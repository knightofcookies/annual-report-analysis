Banking, by its very nature has a multiplier effect on the economy. HDFC 
Bank has been at the forefront of banking in India, through innovation,

critical role in achieving individuals' financial goals, fostering business 
growth, making a difference to the lives of people through our social

to even remote parts of the country. We have consistently grown our 
balance sheet and profits while maintaining a best-in-class asset quality. 
Powering 
Progress

Merger: The Power of One
The merger of HDFC Limited with and into HDFC 
Bank has created a stronger financial services 
conglomerate with the addition of subsidiaries like 
HDFC Life, HDFC ERGO and HDFC AMC. This 
has opened up a fresh pathway for future growth 
through the ownership of a reputed home loan 
product, thereby enhancing our ability to serve 
customers better and tap into opportunities for 
cross-sell. Thus, the merger further fortifies our 
position in the market.
Catering to the Financial Needs  
of Indians
We provide a wide array of products and services 
that cater to the diverse needs of retail and business 
(MSMEs and emerging corporates), customers 
spread across metros, urban, semi-urban and rural 
locations. From personal loans and mortgages to

that are designed to meet the evolving requirements 
of our customers. We strive to support every stage 
of a customer's financial journey.

Experience with Digitalisation 
The customer landscape is ever evolving and our 
dynamic customer-centric approach leverages 
the power of technology in meeting their needs. 
The Bank has a robust digital ecosystem that 
enhances customer experience through seamless 
online journeys, driving operational efficiencies 
and enabling the customer to stay connected 
with the Bank on a continuous basis. We prioritise 
personalised digital banking, offering tailored 
solutions and inclusive access. 
Driving Change Through Parivartan
Through our CSR initiative, Parivartan, we impact 
the lives of people and are committed to developing 
sustainable ecosystems through five focused 
areas. These are Rural Development, Education, 
Skill Development and Livelihood Enhancement, 
Healthcare and Hygiene, and Financial Literacy and 
Inclusion. These contribute towards societal growth 
and social well-being.  
Growing with Our People
At HDFC Bank, we are committed to grow with our 
people. We foster an inclusive environment where 
every employee has the tools to succeed. We value

Sustainability is a core value of the Bank. Evaluating 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
risks is now a part of our credit appraisal process. 
Capturing ESG data from our internal operations 
remains a priority. We have committed to becoming 
a carbon-neutral organisation by Financial Year 
2031-32. Our unrelenting efforts in this direction 
have enabled us to continuously enhance our 
transparency and disclosure practices.

sight of Governance standards. Our Governance 
Framework ensures rigorous compliance with 
regulations maintaining robust risk management 
and internal controls, to ensure sustainable value 
creation for our stakeholders.

a pivotal role. We at HDFC Bank are well positioned 
to contribute to this, through our innovative

ABOUT THE REPORT
The Integrated Annual Report for 
FY 2023-24 offers a comprehensive 
overview of HDFC Bank’s (referred to as 
‘We’, ‘Us’, or ‘the Bank’) journey in fulfilling 
its purpose, demonstrating how the 
Bank generates value for stakeholders, 
including customers, shareholders, 
investors, regulators, employees, and 
society. The merger of HDFC Bank 
and erstwhile HDFC Ltd represents a 
significant milestone, creating a robust 
entity positioned to influence India’s 
growth trajectory. This commitment 
underscores the Bank’s value creation 
narrative and its broader impact. Beyond 
financial metrics, the report delves 
into non-financial performance, risks, 
opportunities, strategic priorities, and 
sustainability efforts. Additionally, it also 
provides insights into the governance 
and risk management framework that 
underpins the Bank’s performance.
Reporting Principles and 
Framework
The financial information presented in this 
report is in line with the requirements of
• The Companies Act, 2013 (including 
the rules made thereunder)
• The Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2006
• The Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015
• The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
other relevant RBI regulations
The report has been prepared in 
alignment with the <IR> framework 
prescribed by the IFRS Foundation and 
also contains disclosures with reference 
to GRI Standards 2021, Task Force on 
Climate related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR), BRSR 
Core and United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs). The Bank 
is committed to the improvement of data 
quality, continuous adoption of evolving 
guidance against reporting standards 
and learning from industry practices. This 
endeavor has prompted some necessary 
restatements to the historical data shared 
in the report. Significant restatements 
are highlighted and explained in the 
notes accompanying the relevant KPIs, 
providing stakeholders with detailed 
information about the reasons for and 
implications of these adjustments.
Materiality and Scope
This report includes information which is 
material to all stakeholders of the Bank 
and provides an overview of its business 
and related activities. The report discloses 
matters that substantially impact or affect 
the Bank’s ability to create value and 
could influence decisions of providers of 
financial capital. In FY23, we conducted 
a materiality assessment in accordance 
with the updated GRI Standards 2021. In 
FY24, the material matters thus identified 
were reviewed and refreshed to integrate 
the concept of double materiality. These 
reprioritised matters now represent topics 
which are not only relevant with respect to 
their financial significance to our business 
but also in terms of potential impacts on 
the planet and the society. For GRI topics

Reporting Boundary
The non-financial information in this 
report covers the activities and progress 
of the Bank on a standalone basis.

HDFC Investments Limited ("eHDFC 
Investments") and erstwhile HDFC 
Holdings Limited ("eHDFC Holdings"), 
merged with and into erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation 
Limited (“eHDFC Limited”) and thereafter 
eHDFC Limited merged with and into 
HDFC Bank Limited , thus the non-

year ended March 31, 2024 includes the

2023 to March 31, 2024.The report covers 
information pertaining to the period from

Further, in order to ensure consistency 
and completeness of the non-financial

methodologies/assumptions with respect 
to scope 1 emissions, which are different 
than those adopted in the previous 
financial year and appropriate notes have 
been given to explain the same under the 
‘Environment’ section.
As a result of the merger and changes 
as mentioned above, the non-financial 
information of the Bank for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 is not comparable with 
that of the previous financial year.

Distribution 
Network
OUR PRESENCE
Our nationwide distribution network 
spans metro, urban, semi-urban and 
rural areas. Through our strategically 
positioned 8,738 branches , we 
not only bolster customer service 
but also broaden accessibility in 
previously underserved markets. 
Our overseas branches are tailored 
specifically to meet the needs of 
Non-Resident Indian (NRI) customers. 
Further, the merger strengthens our 
geographic coverage by integrating 
HDFC Limited's footprint with the 
Bank’s pan India network, ensuring 
comprehensive service across 
the country.
The Bank’s network encompasses 
branches, Business Correspondents 
(BCs), ATMs and Cash Recycler 
Machines. The physical presence, 
the digital platforms and innovative 
products come together to offer 
seamless banking experiences. The 
Bank is aligned with the Government's 
Digital Banking Units Initiative (DBUs) 
to extend efficient, secure, paperless 
banking services to remote areas. 
We have established four DBUs in 
Haridwar, Chandigarh, Faridabad, 
and South 24 Parganas, West Bengal. 
These units offer a human touch, 
fostering trust and connectivity 
within communities.
HDFC Bank's investments in its distribution network 
underscores the significance of these for granular and 
sustainable funding into the future. This is evident through 
the observed geometric progression in deposit mobilisation 
over the tenure of each branch. Moreover, the Bank believes 
that physical presence will be a key factor in customer 
engagement, even as digitalisation becomes ubiquitous. 
Therefore, we envision our branches evolving into 
experience hubs facilitating deeper customer relationships 
and enhancing the overall banking experience.

OUR JOURNEYCHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE
A Year of Synergy, Resilience and Growth 
Dear Stakeholders,
Greetings!
It gives me immense pleasure to  
present to you the Integrated Annual 
Report of your Bank for the Financial 
Year 2023-24.
I would like to congratulate my fellow 
Board members, the entire team of 
the Bank and erstwhile HDFC Limited 
for having accomplished one of the 
most complex mergers in the financial 
services industry by completing the 
process in a very seamless, efficient 
and effective manner. I am grateful for 
the support of Government of India, the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), 
Competition Commission of India (CCI), 
Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (IRDAI), the stock 
exchanges and other regulatory 
authorities for providing their approvals 
and guidance during the entire process.
The merger has further strengthened 
our position as a leading financial 
conglomerate of India and our Bank 
is now the custodian of the venerated 
HDFC brand that was created and 
nurtured by the late Mr. H T Parekh, 
Mr. Deepak Parekh and capable and 
eminent members of his team.
Economy Growing at a 
Rapid Pace and Showing 
Great Resilience
The Indian economy as well as your 
Bank have demonstrated resilience in a 
world characterised by headwinds and 
uncertainties. The sound policies and 
timely interventions of RBI have ensured 
that we were well prepared for the 
monetary tightening that happened in 
the developed world after the inflationary 
pressures manifested themselves across 
the globe. The Bank has responded 
to the evolving liquidity scenario 
and calibrated its response over the 
past year.
The financial year gone by has seen 
the GDP in India grow at 8.2 per cent 
while global GDP growth was 3.2 per 
cent in 2023. We continue to remain the 
world’s fastest growing major economy, 
with GDP growth projected at 7.2 per 
cent in the current financial year. This 
has come about despite a slowdown 
in global growth. The GDP growth has 
been supported by a boost in capital 
expenditure, particularly in infrastructure 
development, including roads, highways, 
railways and housing. Between FY22 
and FY24, overall capex growth in the 
economy stood at 11.0 per cent on an 
average with government doing the 
heavy lifting. Private sector investment 
also showed some signs of resurgence 
in sectors such as cement, steel, and 
oil and gas. Growth has also received 
a fillip through a rise in manufacturing 
and construction activity. This has been 
due to a combination of lower input 
costs, Government support to the Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) 
sector through Emergency Credit Line 
Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and large 
scale manufacturing through schemes 
like Production Linked Incentive (PLI).
Overall, the past fiscal year has shown 
strong macroeconomic fundamentals 
of the country. However, slowdown 
in household savings has put a strain 
on liquidity across the economy. Your 
Bank has been well placed to obtain 
the benefits of this growth and has 
actively funded the small and medium 
enterprises that form the backbone of 
the economy as well retail consumers, 
managing well within the constraints 
of liquidity and elevated costs of 
incremental funding.
Reaping Synergies  
of the Merger
As we complete one year of the merger, 
I am happy to note that the process 
of integration has been completed 
seamlessly and efficiently across 
all dimensions of the business and 
customer services and we have put 
in place robust risk management 
and compliance functions from a 
supervisory perspective for the Bank 
and the subsidiaries, which now cover 
a substantially large footprint in the 
financial services domain. The synergies 
of the merger are being manifested 
through the combined strengths of the 
two merged entities, the home loan 
expertise of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
and the extensive distribution franchise 
of HDFC Bank. Today, most of our 
branches are selling home loans, 
including those in semi urban and 
rural locations. As the nation's growth 
story unfolds, we stand prepared 
to reap the benefits through this 
historic combination.
HDFC Bank Limited

CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE
Financial Performance 
and Beyond
HDFC Bank's financial performance in 
the past year demonstrated resilience 
amidst challenges, with market share 
growth in deposits as well as advances. 
The Bank ensured prudent risk 
management and asset quality across 
portfolios. Its profit after tax grew by 
37.9 per cent to H60,812.3 crore on 
a standalone post-merger basis. A 
comprehensive view of our performance 
is captured in the report placed 
before you.
Governance
As a fully Board governed entity with no 
promoter, the weight of responsibility 
is on us to ensure best standards of 
governance to look after the interests 
of shareholders, depositors, employees 
and other stakeholders. As a responsible 
financial institution, we strive to create 
sustained value for all our stakeholders 
without compromising on our core 
values of Customer Focus, Operational 
Excellence, Product Leadership, People 
and Sustainability in our day-to-day 
operations. These values continue 
to be upheld as we keep maintaining 
stringent standards of corporate 
governance, placing significant 
emphasis on fundamental principles 
such as independence, accountability, 
responsibility, transparency and 
timely disclosure.
Throughout the year, the Board 
Committee meetings were convened 
regularly, playing a pivotal role in 
assessing critical areas of the Bank's 
governance. These Committees facilitate 
the governance and supervisory 
responsibilities of the Board members 
as they provide oversight and feedback 
on critical areas and the performance of 
the management of the Bank. Cognisant 
of our status as a large financial 
conglomerate we have also put in place 
group level oversight of compliance 
and risk management of the diverse 
subsidiaries, while at the same time 
making their respective management 
teams accountable for governance 
and compliance.
During the year Mr. Sashidhar Jagdishan 
was reappointed as the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer 
of the Bank with effect from October 
27, 2023. Mr. Kaizad M Bharucha, was 
elevated as Deputy Managing Director 
of the Bank w.e.f. April 19, 2023. 
Mr. Bhavesh Zaveri and Mr. V. Srinivasa 
Rangan were appointed as Executive 
Directors to the Board with effect from 
April 19, 2023 and November 23, 
2023 respectively.
Customer Experience  
and Building Technology 
for the Future
In the evolving banking landscape 
with fast changing technology, our 
unwavering focus remains on our 
customers and our commitment to 
enhancing customer experiences and 
obtaining increased share of their wallet 
through innovation and technology. 
Over the last year, we have achieved 
significant milestones with key products, 
services and innovations backed 
by robust technology infrastructure, 
reinforcing our dedication to digital 
transformation and fully embracing 
digital banking. The achievements on 
our digital banking initiatives highlight 
our commitment to delivering world 
class and secure banking services, 
ensuring the safety and trust of our 
customers, and making technology our 
key competitive differentiator. We are 
committed to providing personalised 
solutions and ensuring banking services 
are inclusive and accessible to the wide 
spectrum of our society.
Social Value Creation
While the merger with erstwhile HDFC 
Limited has been the core focus during 
the year under review, it is equally 
important to reiterate the strides our 
Bank has made in our continuing 
commitment to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) and social value 
creation. Given the large scale of our 
operations and strong profitability, 
we recognise the criticality of giving 
back to the very communities in which 
we operate.
Economic and financial wellbeing of 
society is what every responsible lender 
should aspire for. Our commitment to 
this principle is underscored in our CSR 
programme. Our core focus areas are 
Rural Development, Education, Skilling 
and Livelihood, Healthcare and Financial 
Literacy and Inclusion. Our Bank has 
cumulatively impacted over 10 crore lives 
through our social initiatives.
As a Bank, we also stand resolute with 
the government in its endeavour to 
promote financial inclusion. The CSR 
programme of your Bank supplements 
the government’s flagship welfare 
schemes aimed at improving the 
lives of farmers, protecting vulnerable 
segments of society through micro 
insurance, pensions, loans to MSMEs 
and urban and rural livelihood initiatives, 
amongst others.
As a large financier, we understand the 
need to align with the country’s strategy 
towards decarbonisation. The Board of 
your Bank increased oversight on ESG 
disclosures and climate-related risks as 
well as keeping abreast with evolving 
regulatory frameworks.
In Conclusion
I extend my sincere thanks to all our 
stakeholders for their continued support, 
and most of all, to the large HDFC Bank 
family of over two hundred thousand 
people. Needless to say, it is the 
collective passion and commitment of 
all that will allow us to achieve the future 
growth of the institution.

OUR JOURNEYMESSAGE FROM THE MD & CEO
Merger Synergies Playing Out
Dear Shareholders,
Warm greetings to you all.
The year gone by was one of both, 
continuity and change. Continuity, as 
India remained the fastest growing 
major economy in the world; change, 
as there was a transformational 
merger between parent, HDFC Limited 
and HDFC Bank. I feel fortunate to 
be a part of the Indian economy 
right now, which is teeming with 
opportunities. As per the International  
Monetary Fund (IMF), India will 
continue to be a driver for global 
growth in the foreseeable future. 
Last year, as you’re aware, we 
concluded the merger of HDFC 
Limited with the Bank, a momentous 
event in the organisation’s history. 
Your Bank worked on fortifying 
all aspects of the merger, during 
the nine months of Financial Year 
2023-24 spent as a merged entity. 
The successful conclusion of the 
merger and seamless integration of 
the entities have further added to 
my confidence in the organisation’s 
resilience and pride in the execution 
capability of the team at HDFC Bank 
and HDFC Limited, which is now part 
of the Bank. 
With our financial discipline, prudent 
investment in technology and a 
passionate commitment to customer 
centricity, I’m pleased to report 
that your Bank has performed well 
in a year that witnessed such a 
significant development.

MESSAGE FROM THE MD & CEO
Macroeconomic 
Environment
Global GDP growth moderated in 
2023 to 3.2 per cent from 3.5 per 
cent amid monetary tightening in 
developed economies, geopolitical 
tensions in parts of the globe and 
rising commodity prices. The Indian 
economy bucked this trend and 
recorded a growth of 8.2 per cent in 
Financial Year 2023-24 from a growth 
rate of 7.0 per cent in the previous 
financial year - the highest among 
major economies. 
The country’s GDP growth averaged 
8.3 per cent annually over the last 
three fiscal years, the highest in 
the Asia-Pacific region. This was 
supported by a capital expenditure 
boost (particularly in infrastructure 
development, including roads, 
railways, and housing), moderating 
inflation, strong manufacturing 
performance and healthy consumer 
demand, especially in urban areas.
Overall credit growth has been in 
double digits since April 2022. Higher 
demand for consumer durables and 
greater retail spends have boosted 
retail credit growth. Retail loans have 
increased at a CAGR of 19 per cent 
over the last five years, outpacing the 
growth in nominal GDP. During this 
period, the RBI has issued advisory 
to banks on strengthening the 
acquisition, monitoring and collection 
process as the unsecured loan growth 
has outpaced the overall loan growth. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
anticipates India’s GDP growth to be 
at 7.2 per cent in Financial Year 2024-
25. Economic activity is likely to be 
supported by further pick-up in private 
capital expenditure and continued 
Government capital spending. 
In addition, domestic consumer 
spending is expected to see further 
recovery particularly in rural areas.
Moreover, the benefit from 
Government reforms and support 
measures over the last few years, 
like the Production Linked Incentive 
(PLI) schemes is likely to boost 
manufacturing activity and attract 
FDI flows. Besides, a continued 
diversification of supply chains to 
newer emerging markets is likely to 
benefit investment flows into India. 
India is clearly in a good place 
for economic growth and we feel 
well placed to capitalise on the 
positive environment. 
The Merger
We’ve recently completed one year of 
the merger which formally came into 
effect on July 1, 2023. In many ways 
it is now a new organisation with a 
different balance sheet composition. 
For example, it has a higher proportion 
of borrowing at 21 per cent versus 
8 per cent pre-merger and a lower 
CASA ratio. Key metrics of the new 
organisation will be different than that 
of pre-merger levels. For us, this is 
HDFC Bank 2.0 that has to be seen 
differently, and comparing with the 
past in terms of metrics would not be 
the right way.
The merger has presented the Bank 
with a massive opportunity which 
we’re working to seize. India is 
today in the midst of unprecedented 
urbanisation, fuelled by rising incomes 
and aspirations cutting across metros 
and beyond. The real estate sector 
is expected to reach a market size 
of US$1 trillion by 2030, a significant 
increase from US$ 200 billion in 
2021, contributing 13 per cent to the 
country’s GDP by 2025.
The merger has opened up fresh 
vistas for growth through the 
mortgage business, not only through 
increase in home loan disbursals, 
but also by leveraging customer 
engagement with the cross-sell 
opportunities across the HDFC 
Bank Group.
Your Bank has exhibited robust and 
consistent double-digit, year-on-
year growth across its Home Loan 
business for the first nine months, 
post the merger. On a sequential basis 
too, it has gained a leading position 
recording a growth of 4 per cent.
Pre-merger approximately 30 to 35 
per cent of incremental home loan 
disbursals were to customers with an 
HDFC Bank savings account. This 
has now touched approximately 85 
per cent of incremental disbursals in 
a space of just nine months. This has 
been possible due to the extensive 
distribution network of the Bank, 
seamless integration of bundled 
journeys and the execution capability 
of our teams on the ground, which I 
am really proud of. Our ability to build 
a strong liability franchise leveraging 
home loan customers is well on its 
way to fruition.
Our home loan customers also enjoy 
the benefit of a strong suite of financial 
products and solutions that the Bank 
can offer, like credit cards, consumer 
durable loans, wealth products, 
and insurance. This approach helps 
strengthen customer relationship and 
enables HDFC Bank emerge as the 
primary banker for these customers. 
While we have seen strong traction 
on savings accounts being opened 
along with home loans, we will now 
focus our energies on leveraging the 
cross-sell opportunity of both, the

MESSAGE FROM THE MD & CEO
Bank and the Group’s products to 
these customers, by way of seamless 
technology enabled customer journeys 
and a value proposition that attracts 
the customers. While we remain 
committed to an open architecture 
model, we do expect to distribute 
more of the subsidiaries investment 
and insurance products, leading to an 
increase in fee income.
We continue to spearhead several 
digital initiatives to enhance customer 
convenience and expedite the home 
loan process. Leveraging technology, 
these initiatives aim to streamline 
the process and ensure faster 
turnaround times.
All in all, the task of bringing together 
the leadership teams, technology 
infrastructures, and cultures of the two 
entities has been successful, allowing 
us to pursue our organisation goals as 
one team. 
Our Performance
Your Bank grew in the last financial 
year while continuing to demonstrate 
its traditional balance sheet resilience. 
The figures for the period ended 
March 31, 2024 include the operations 
of erstwhile HDFC Limited, which 
amalgamated with and into HDFC 
Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence 
the comparisons with the previous 
periods have to be looked at in light of 
the same.
On a standalone basis the Profit After 
Tax (PAT) for the year ended March 31, 
2024 was H60,812.3 crore, up by 37.9 
per cent over the year ended March 
31, 2023. Net Interest Income (NII) for 
the year ended March 31, 2024 was 
H1,08, 532 crore up 25.0 per cent over 
the year ended March 31, 2023. The 
figure crossed the Rupee one trillion 
mark for the first time in the Bank’s 
history. Core Net Interest Margin stood 
at 3.53 per cent and Gross NPAs at 
1.24 per cent. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
around our Net Interest Margin (NIM) 
and credit to deposit ratio post our 
merger as well as the path we would 
pursue, given the scale of deposit 
mobilisation required for our growth 
needs. Post the merger, we are 
looking at a very different liability 
profile. We are clear in our intent of 
pursuing profitable growth. The Bank 
will continue to focus on granular 
deposit mobilisation leveraging 
our inherent distribution strengths 
and the execution focus that we 
are known for. It is our endeavour 
to bring down the credit to deposit 
ratio to pre-merger levels and our 
focus would be to maintain adequate 
liquidity buffers, repayment of eHDFC 
borrowings as and when they mature, 
including weighing any prepayment 
opportunities that may arise, and 
pursuing profitable sources of lending. 
During this time of adjustment, the 
Bank would grow its advances a 
little slower than the deposit growth. 
We will avoid pursuing growth which 
does not meet our risk adjusted 
profitability thresholds, in line with the 
Bank’s  philosophy. 
Technology Update 
I have been consistently sharing 
updates with you on my key focus 
areas - improving technology 
resilience, building for the future, and 
the three Cs: Culture, Conscience, 
and Customer. Let me now elaborate 
on these.
Technology has become the 
cornerstone of modern banking, 
driving innovation, security, efficiency, 
and new customer experiences. The 
Bank embraces technology's evolution 
into a growth catalyst through the 
‘Shift Right’ strategy. Our vision is to 
shift from a product-centric approach 
to a customer-centric one through five 
transformation pillars built on modern 
technology constructs.
With Journeys being a key enabler, 
the Bank now has over 30 acquisition 
journeys and 15 servicing journeys, 
including exciting launches such 
as FD booking, gold loan top-ups, 
and innovative home loan cross-sell 
offerings. Today, more than three-
quarters of our acquisitions are 
digitally driven, with straight-through 
processing leading to paperless 
experiences. Our state-of-the-art 
commercial loan origination engine 
facilitates in-principle approvals for 
customers within 30 minutes.
We are taking significant steps to 
transform our digital Channels  into 
holistic platforms. Our indigenous 
mobile and net banking platforms 
are set to introduce a host of new 
experiences. In the past year, many of 
our platforms have gained significant 
traction. For instance, SmartWealth 
already has over 1,00,000 customers 
and Chat Banking through WhatsApp 
is the preferred channel with over 
90 lakh monthly interactions. On 
PayZapp, we now have more than 75 
lakh registered customers leveraging 
innovative features such as Tap to 
Pay and Swipe to Pay, whereas 
SmartHub Vyapar now has over 16 
lakh merchants. With our dedicated 
API Factory, we seek to build 
upon Banking as a Service (BaaS) 
capabilities, witnessing rapid adoption 
by large and medium corporates, thus 
expanding our footprint. CBX, our 
corporate banking platform, has now 
HDFC Bank Limited
22
scaled up to over 1,30,000 customers 
with more than 2 crore transactions in 
the previous month.
Core banking systems are being 
reinforced with further progress 
in our 'Hollow the Core' strategy 
towards modernised engineering for 
improved resilience and scale. We 
have also scaled up key systems to 
accommodate the further expansion 
of our branches and are increasing 
our hardware and infrastructure 
capacity by upgrading to a next-gen 
core platform. Additionally, we have 
deployed new platforms in retail 
assets and microfinance for increased 
resilience. We introduced a digital-only 
platform for credit cards, enabling us 
to launch PIXEL cards. In summary, 
we are reinforcing our core platforms 
across retail business landscape.
With Data as the focal point of our 
strategy, we have made substantial 
progress in our Data Lake initiative 
for improved data governance and 
quality. This will pave the way for a 
holistic reengineering of our enterprise 
customer database, furthering the 
‘Hollow the Core’ strategy. The Bank 
has taken multiple strides and is 
actively leveraging Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in 
areas such as fraud monitoring, risk 
management, credit decisioning 
and marketing analytics. This year 
saw the explosion of GenAI as a key, 
once-in-a-generation technology 
capability; and your Bank has been 
actively exploring use cases that 
could eventually prove instrumental 
in revolutionising areas like image 
recognition, language translation 
and statement analysis. We are also 
mindful of adopting these technologies 
within regulatory and security 
guardrails in a calibrated manner.
Having a stronger commitment 
than ever to Security, we have 
further bolstered our posture 
through frameworks such as Zero 
Trust Architecture for strengthened 
security and multi-layered defence 
mechanisms. Our Cyber Security 
Operations Center is now powered 
by an advanced AI/ML based 
platform, which can detect attack 
patterns with high accuracy. We are 
also advancing to adopt security 
engineering practices natively 
in our software engineering and 
development lifecycles.
I am proud to share that technology 
played a crucial role in ensuring a 
seamless merger despite substantial 
complexities. Integrating over 100 
applications through data migration 
and a multitude of backend system 
changes, the activity was fully 
managed and executed by in-house 
teams imbibing us with further 
confidence in our capabilities.
Looking ahead, I am excited about 
the opportunities that come our way 
as we continue our journey towards 
becoming a future-ready digital 
bank. Our commitment to delivering 
exceptional experiences and inclusive 
banking services will be driven by the 
adoption of new-age technologies 
focusing on scalability, resilience and 
security while building the bank for 
the future. 
Cyber Security
At HDFC Bank, cybersecurity and 
data privacy best practices are 
important priorities. The Bank remains 
committed to maintaining a secure 
cybersecurity posture to protect its 
technology, confidential information, 
data integrity, and business continuity. 
Our strong information security 
programme, security policies and 
processes are aligned with various 
information security management 
frameworks in the industry and 
provide necessary assurance 
on protecting the Bank’s critical 
information. It is an ongoing battle 
which requires continuous investment 
as the threat landscape is constantly 
evolving.  
Our deepest anguish is the threat 
landscape our customers face leading 
to compromise of their credentials and 
a financial loss. The Bank has invested 
in technology using AI and ML to 
arrest attempts at customers falling 
prey to scams and fraudsters. We urge 
customers to continue to be vigilant 
and follow safe banking practices, not 
allowing socially engineered fraud to 
succeed. The Bank has regularly been 
running Secure Banking campaigns 
through social media, SMS, Emails, 
ATMs, Bank website and various 
other channels. Your Bank’s Vigil 
Aunty campaign covering the various 
modus-operandi of fraudsters is one 
such example of awareness building. 
Further, we continue to collaborate 
with law enforcement agencies, 
regulatory authorities and peer 
banks to educate customers on safe 
banking practices. 
Customer Centricity 
My biggest priorities remain 
deep customer engagement and 
strengthening a Service First culture. 
Our implementation of Net Promoter 
System (NPS), branded as ‘Infinite 
Smiles’ programme has been one 
of the largest implementations in 
the world. This programme provides 
us with immediate and continuous 
customer feedback for us to listen, 
learn and act on the feedback, 
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
23
Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and  
Financial Statements
MESSAGE FROM THE MD & CEO
across our entire suite of products 
and services. We have a robust 
governance framework in place to 
continuously listen to this feedback 
and take appropriate action. I am 
glad to report that compared to the 
last financial year we have an eight 
percentage points improvement in our 
NPS score. 
To further improve the Service First 
culture, we have instituted two 
key initiatives this year along with 
increasing the weightage of service 
in the performance measurement 
framework across all levels in 
the organisation. The first one is 
a structured intervention centre 
framework to continuously monitor 
our customer experience delivery 
across the customer life cycle. The 
response from our colleagues has 
been tremendous for this framework. 
We are seeing good improvements 
in getting the customer experience 
delivery right the first time as well as 
achieving faster turnaround times. The 
digitalisation of many of our service 
and acquisition journeys is also 
being increasingly adopted, both by 
employees and customers, resulting 
in further improvements. The second 
one is highly monitored coaching of 
our front end colleagues for deeper 
customer engagement. Whilst the 
initiatives have yielded results, we have 
a long way to go to reach a new orbit 
in Service First culture. 
People
I am proud to share with you the 
progress that we have made in 
our quest to be a more inclusive 
organisation. The year marked 
several milestones in this journey, an 
important one being our meeting and 
exceeding the threshold we had set 
for ourselves - that 25 per cent of our 
workforce should comprise women 
by 2025. Women representation in our 
workforce currently exceeds 55,000 
employees and has crossed 26 
per cent.
The Bank, like the rest of the BFSI 
sector, has experienced a volatile 
talent landscape in recent times. 
Attrition was a matter of concern for 
the Bank as it was for the industry in 
Financial Year 2022-23. However, in 
Financial year 2023-24, most of the 
industry has seen a slight moderation 
in the attrition rate and that is reflected 
in our numbers too. Nevertheless, in 
Financial Year 2023-24 the Bank has 
taken several efforts to arrest attrition, 
including setting up a task force at the 
highest level to identify the controllable 
causes and taking corrective action. 
Managers are the primary custodians 
of talent, and much effort has 
been made to raise awareness and 
accountability towards retention and 
engagement of their teams. Your Bank 
has invested in improving employee 
experience across various touch 
points along the employee lifecycle. 
This includes an enhanced onboarding 
experience, curated customised 
professional learning through Mpower 
(our learning experience platform) 
and an active listening framework, to 
stay connected with the pulse on the 
ground. As a result, in Financial Year 
2023-24, we saw a drop in new joiner 
attrition by 10 per cent over last year 
and the overall attrition drop by over 7 
per cent.
Your Bank continues to invest in 
upskilling its talent base of over 
2,00,000 employees. Employees are 
actively leveraging learning on a wide 
range of skills as well as emerging 
technologies, clocking over 65 lakh 
learning hours in Financial Year 2023-
24. The year saw the introduction 
of an AI based learning experience 
platform for employees which enjoyed 
an adoption rate of 86 per cent in 
the first 30 days, getting off to a 
promising start.
Over the last few years, we have 
institutionalised Nurture, Care 
and Collaborate as a Managerial 
Behavioural Architecture. This has 
impacted the overall culture and 
employee experience as evidenced 
in the progressive positive shift in 
the employee sentiment scores over 
the last four years (75 per cent in 
Financial Year 2019-20 to 86 per cent 
in Financial Year 2023-24). Having said 
that, there is still much to be done and 
we are earnestly working on it to make 
this institution an even better place to 
work for.
The year gone by has been especially 
memorable for the Bank because 
we welcomed our colleagues from 
erstwhile HDFC Limited into the 
Bank’s fold. The amalgamation was 
a smooth one given that the culture 
and values of the organisations were 
aligned. We have always held that the 
talent, commitment and passion of our 
people is the bedrock of our success 
and investing in this talent pool can 
only add to a service first culture and 
good customer experience. 
Getting The Organisation 
Future Ready 
In 2021, the Bank announced Project 
Future Ready and we continue to 
make considerable progress in this. 
The following areas were identified as 
growth engines: Commercial (MSME) 
and Rural Banking, Government 
and Institutional Business, Wealth 
Management, Retail Assets, Corporate 
Banking, and Payments. These were 
to be driven by our delivery channels 
HDFC Bank Limited
24
of Branch Banking, TeleSales/Service/
Relationship and Digital Marketing 
backed by our technology and 
digital platforms.
The addition of home loans to 
the Bank’s portfolio adds a new 
dimension to the strategy especially 
the retail business.
To report on the past year, our Gross 
Advances (ex-merger) grew by 17.3 
per cent and Deposits (ex-merger) 
grew by 18.4 per cent.
An important word on Branch 
Banking. The Bank added over 900 
branches in the year under review 
and will continue to add more in the 
current financial year. More than half 
our branches are in the semi urban 
and rural areas where a physical 
presence is often a necessity although 
the majority of the transactions are 
digital in nature. These phygital 
branches are our investments. 
They will undoubtedly help garner 
deposits in the future, but it is the 
older branches that will act as current 
engines of deposit mobilisation. Our 
experience clearly reveals that there 
is an exponential growth in deposit 
base as the branches age. Our past 
experience indicates that deposit 
mobilisation has a strong correlation 
to the vintage of the branch. The 
investment in new branches is to 
ensure that we do not lose out on 
opportunities for the future while the 
existing branches continue to drive 
deposit growth.
Environmental, Social  
and Governance 
The significance of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) 
parameters can hardly be understated 
and we are fully conscious of the need 
for increased Board engagement 
on strategies that shape the Bank’s 
future pathways. Your Bank not only 
remains steadfast in its commitment 
to transparency in reporting on both, 
financial and non-financial parameters, 
but is now moving beyond this. 
While globally ESG frameworks are 
still evolving, our ESG disclosures 
are increasingly going through a 
similar rigour as financial parameters 
- especially with the mandating of 
assurance on certain ESG attributes.
The year under review marked the 
issuance of our first sustainable bond 
in the international markets which was 
well received. On the lending side, we 
continue to integrate environmental 
and social due diligence as an integral 
part of our overall credit assessments.
ESG considerations also have 
dependencies on the overall global 
macro and geopolitical environment, 
pace of policy and regulatory reforms 
and technology breakthroughs, 
especially pertaining to the transition 
to cleaner energy pathways. As the 
Bank navigates through the evidently 
growing climate-related financial 
risks and other unknown risks, we 
recognise the importance of a fortified 
and resilient balance sheet and the 
need to build buffers from a position 
of strength, so as to safeguard 
against future unforeseen shocks and 
stress scenarios.
Through our CSR initiatives under 
‘Parivartan’ we have impacted the 
lives of over 10 crore people. From 
upskilling farmers on scientific 
cropping patterns, providing 
placement linked training and 
mentoring of entrepreneurs, to 
supporting start-ups through 
incubators our consistent efforts have 
been to create an inclusive society. 
Providing livelihood opportunities 
remains at the core of all our initiatives.
In Financial Year 2023-24, the 
Bank has met its CSR obligations. 
Your Bank has executed its 
CSR commitments through 
210+ partnerships and over 260 
projects across 28 states and 8 
union territories.
Conclusion 
We began the second quarter of the 
last financial year with the merger. 
As we concluded the year, we saw 
merger synergies starting to play 
out. This fills us with optimism for the 
current financial year and beyond. 
Especially given the anticipated 
growth in the Indian economy. We will 
continue to pursue profitable growth 
without sacrificing asset quality.
Looking to the future, I’m confident 
that with the immensely talented and 
dedicated team at HDFC Bank, we will 
continue to innovate, drive sustainable 
growth, and make a positive impact 
on the communities we serve.
I would like to conclude with 
thanking my colleagues across the 
organisation, for their sterling support 
and commitment to the Bank’s valued 
customers. My thanks also to our 
Board and all stakeholders,  who 
have continuously supported us over 
the years.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Delivering 
Consistent and 
Profitable Growth
The Financial Year 2023-24 was the year of the merger. The 
Balance Sheet size grew by 46.7 per cent in the fiscal, with 
a 26.4 per cent increase in Deposits and a 55.2 per cent 
growth in Advances. The Bank consolidated its position 
as the largest private sector bank by Balance Sheet size in 
India without compromising its asset quality.
This was achieved through the 
extensive reach across our 8,738 
branches as well as our strong digital 
footprint. Our Profit After Tax grew by 
37.9 per cent and GNPA stood at  
1.24 per cent.
The Cost to Income Ratio marginally 
decreased to 40.2 per cent in FY24 
from 40.4 per cent in FY23.
The Bank added over 900 branches 
in the Financial Year ended March 31, 
2024. The Core Net Interest Margin 
was at 3.53 per cent.
We remain well-capitalised which 
is reflected in our Capital Adequacy 
Ratio of 18.8 per cent. As a 
responsible bank, we have built 
a substantial cushion against any 
adverse impact with a Provision 
Coverage Ratio of 74.04 per cent. 
We continued to deliver value to 
shareholders, with an ROE of  
16.1 per cent. Our Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) increased by 8.2 per cent to 
H85.8, while dividend per share rose 
by 2.6 per cent to H19.5 in FY24.

Established in 2021, the Bank's Commercial and Rural 
Banking (CRB) Group caters to a diverse range of entities 
including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), 
farmers (including the small and marginal ones), healthcare 
finance, equipment finance, commercial transport companies 
as well as joint liability and self-help groups. 
COMMERCIAL AND RURAL BANKING
The diverse businesses are bound 
together by the common thread 
of having a significant presence in 
Semi Urban and Rural (SURU) India. 
More than half of our branches are 
located in SURU regions ensuring 
comprehensive coverage and 
accessibility to financial services 
where they are most needed. This 
strategic distribution facilitates 
easier access to banking facilities 
thus empowering individuals and 
businesses in these areas.
The CRB Group significantly 
contributes to the Bank's Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) obligations 
which has assumed further 
significance post the merger. It also 
plays a pivotal role in advancing the 
financial inclusion agenda. Moreover, 
it is a profitable business, with a 
high Return on Assets (ROA) and 
effectively managed Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) due to adept 
sourcing channels and prudent risk 
management practices.
HDFC Bank Limited

Propelled by the extensive geographical 
reach and profound understanding 
of local business dynamics, the CRB 
Business has displayed healthy growth 
since inception. HDFC Bank holds 
a leading position in MSME lending, 
leading in 14 states and securing a 
position among the top 3 in 21 states.
A dedicated relationship team 
ensures regular interactions with CRB 
customers, addressing their banking 
needs comprehensively and cross-
selling various products and services. 
There is a robust growth strategy in 
place for all major offerings. 
Agricultural financing is a key revenue 
stream and the group is geared to 
seize promising opportunities in Agri-
infrastructure financing and diversifying 
into high-income agricultural products 
like dairy and horticulture. The Bank 
is present in 2.25 lakh villages to 
fund traditional agriculture and allied 
activities. Additionally, CRB is also 
dedicated to supporting Government 
schemes like the Agriculture 
Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Farmer 
Producer Organisations (FPOs), and 
Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro 
Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME), 
while also lending to small and 
marginal farmers.
The Bank's strategic emphasis on 
expanding into new territories and 
strengthening the sales force has 
led it to capturing a market leading 
share in the commercial vehicle and 
equipment financing sector. It is also 
actively developing an ecosystem to 
extend reach within the Transportation 
Finance domain supported by a robust 
OEM relationship. 
Digital transformation is pivotal for 
growth across all segments. The Bank 
is digitising various aspects of the 
CRB Business, including customer 
touchpoints, document collection 
processes, sales, and service. 
The emphasis is on building digital 
underwriting capabilities through 
effective data management and 
API integration.
Overall, the CRB segment offers a 
vast market potential, and the Bank 
is poised to seize this opportunity 
through its expansive reach, innovative 
capabilities and digital prowess.

Aligning for 
Impact
HDFC Bank conducts a materiality assessment to discern 
and assess the issues that hold utmost importance for 
our business as well as both our internal and external 
stakeholders. In FY24, we reviewed our materiality assessment 
to comply with the latest GRI Universal Standards 2021 and 
integrate the concept of double materiality. 
MATERIALITY
HDFC Bank Limited
38
This multi-faceted approach 
led to the final ranking of the 
14 sustainability issues into a 
materiality matrix.
The final analysis was presented 
to the Board of Directors.
We began by reviewing 
the 16 sustainability topics 
included in our FY23 materiality 
assessment, identified as a 
result of internal and external 
stakeholder engagements, data 
analysis, regulatory compliance 
and industry benchmarking.
In FY23, we prioritised our material topics by 
consolidating stakeholder survey responses. 
In the first stage, the responses within each 
group were consolidated to derive the 
priorities for the respective groups.
Next, the responses across different 
aspects were consolidated by assigning 
weights to each stakeholder group. The 
collective scores were then used to prioritise 
the topics as "Most important", "Important" 
and "Less important" (considering the reach 
of impacts within our value chain, magnitude 
of the impact, and likelihood of occurrence).
Drawing from the results of FY23, we further 
conducted a thorough analysis for assessing 
the economic, environmental and social impacts 
(positive and/or negative) associated with each 
topic. This was superimposed with the impact 
scores derived from the previous stakeholder 
consultations across two key dimensions 
reflecting impact of the material topics on the 
organisation (financial materiality) and society 
(impact materiality). After careful revaluation of 
16 material topics, few topics were merged to 
derive a list 14 topics relevant to the Bank.
As part of our risk assessment process, 
we have mapped the identified material 
topics against the risk categories which 
are a part of our risk management 
framework. Of the 14 material topics, 
9 have been identified as areas with 
opportunity and the remaining 5 
have the potential to pose risk to 
our business.

Management of Material Topic
At HDFC Bank, we recognise the significant influence we 
hold through our lending and financing activities. Engaging 
in sustainable and responsible financing practices allows 
us to invest in projects and industries that have positive 
environmental and social impacts. This not only aligns our 
values with the growing demand for ethical and sustainable 
investments but also enhances the Bank's reputation as 
a socially responsible institution. Furthermore, sustainable 
financing helps us improve our risk management practices 
by reducing exposure to environmentally and socially risky 
assets as well as foster long-term relationships with clients 
who prioritise sustainability.
We believe in Responsible Financing and, as a rule, do not 
fund projects that are part of our Prohibition List owing to 
the negative impact on the environment, health, and safety. 
Our goal is to make funding available for environmentally 
viable projects that help mitigate climate change. To reduce 
our carbon footprint, we continue to invest in renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects and encourage our 
customers to make "green banking" decisions.
Description of Impact

At HDFC Bank, we have adopted an enhanced and more

Effective risk management safeguards our financial health 
by identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential losses 
from credit defaults, market fluctuations, liquidity issues, 
interest rate changes, and operational failures. Through the 
effective use of processes, information, and technology, 
we have developed a multi-layered risk management 
strategy that identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages 
risks (credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk, and operational risk). Our framework incorporates a 
Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & System, a vital 
component of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP). Stress testing plays a vital role in this 
assessment by simulating a variety of stressful, yet realistic 
scenarios to assess our vulnerability to extreme conditions.
Description of Impact
(Risk: Reputational Risk
Impact: Negative, Potential, Within and  
Outside the Bank)
Effective risk management is crucial to safeguard our 
financial health and prevent systemic instability. As 
a result, our multi-layered risk management strategy 
actively identifies, assesses, and reports the risks 
inherent to our business operations to the appropriate 
levels of management so that risk mitigation actions can 
be implemented. 
Furthermore, we recognise the growing importance of 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Our 
ESG & Climate Change Assessment framework helps 
us identify and mitigate potential ESG risks and climate 
change threats associated with our borrowers and their 
business operations. 
Our independent risk management function ensures 
objectivity and oversight. A robust risk assessment helps 
us evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. 
We then implement a combination of mitigation techniques, 
such as setting credit limits, diversifying loan portfolios, 
managing interest rate exposure, and implementing robust 
internal controls, to proactively manage these risks.

HDFC Bank implements a strategic approach to 
procurement, integrating environmentally and socially 
responsible considerations into our procurement 
practices. This approach yields operational efficiency, 
minimises waste generation, and reduces long-term

As part of our ESG Policy Framework, we recognise the 
need to work closely with our suppliers to reduce waste, 
improve efficiency, reduce carbon footprint, and engage 
with them to understand their commitment towards 
human rights and labour practices. 
We will thus continue to work towards greater 
integration of environmental & social considerations in

HDFC Bank prioritises responsible asset management 
practices throughout the loan lifecycle, contributing to a 
sustainable financial system. Regularly monitoring and 
managing asset quality are essential for maintaining the 
Bank's financial stability and ensuring that we meet the 
obligations to depositors and other stakeholders.
Description of Impact
(Risk: Reputational Risk 
Impact: Risk, Negative, Potential, Within and 
Outside the Bank)
Asset quality is a fundamental risk for banks, directly 
impacting our financial stability. Our assets are 
essentially promises of future repayment. Weak asset 
quality can lead to financial losses and trigger a domino 
effect. This in turn can limit our ability to lend. In 
severe cases, very poor asset quality can even lead to 
disrupting the financial system and impacting depositors 
and the broader economy. Therefore, maintaining a 
high standard of asset quality is critical for us to ensure 
our own financial well-being and contribute to a healthy 
financial system. As part of our Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) Risk Management Policy 
Framework, we evaluate the environmental and social 
risks and opportunities associated with our lending 
activities. This analysis guides our lending decisions 
and fosters client relationships that promote sustainable 
business practices.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
These factors collectively fuel growth 
in GDP and per capita income, 
consequently increasing the demand 
for financial products and services. 
At the Bank, we are well poised to 
capitalise on this opportunity through 
consistent innovation in our offerings 
and technological capabilities. The 
merger of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
with the Bank has further enriched 
our product suite with mortgage and 
realty finance business. Our focus is 
on risk adjusted consistent, profitable 
growth and this drives our strategy 
across all businesses. While pursuing 
this growth trajectory, we remain 
committed to robust governance 
and risk management practices, 
ensuring a harmonious balance 
between expansion and maintaining a 
portfolio quality.
Execution is our strength, as 
evidenced by the seamless integration 
of two financial powerhouses’ post-
merger. This facilitates a deeper 
customer engagement, establishes 
an extensive distribution network and 
fosters growth across all segments. 
We aim to further harness it’s potential

Re-Imagining the

As we recognise the increasing shift 
towards digital transactions, we 
envision the transformation of retail 
branches into engagement centres. 
Rather than being solely transactional, 
branches will serve as platforms 
for meaningful conversations with 
customers. We aim to provide holistic, 
need-based financial solutions by 
leveraging our diverse range of 
products and services. To achieve 
this, we have identified the following

Micro-market Focused Multi 
Format Distribution
We are transforming branch banking 
into a multi-format model based on a 
granular micro market approach. This 
involves using a multi-variate model 
to identify high potential markets, 
considering factors such as population 
demographics, deposits and 
advances data, delinquency insights, 
climate risk assessments and future 
trends. Branch formats may vary from 
full service physical branches to smart 
banking lobbies or digital banking 
units with self-service kiosks as well 
as business correspondent-based 
models. We closely track profitability 
and break-even for each format to 
ensure targeted investments and 
cost-effectiveness. By expanding 
our presence in identified locations 
through multiple formats, we not only 
increase our catchment area but 
also benefit from network effects. 
Therefore, we continue to invest in 
expanding our presence in identified 
locations through multiple formats.

results in recommendations for the 
next best action for each customer. 
Relationship Managers are also

Our capabilities are built to serve

designed to serve and solve for unique 
payment requirements of several 
customer segments and industries 
at scale.
Our payment products are key to 
customer engagement and are built 
on the ethos of payments being a 
crucial driver to deepen the overall 
relationship with the customer and 
become the preferred banker, both for 
liabilities and assets. The narrative is 
always about enabling solutions which 
enhance the customers quality of life 
and also be a part of the customers 
growth journey.
Our credit card business continues 
to be a leader on many fronts. 
Having built best in class products 
and platforms over the last two 
decades we continue to maintain our 
dominance with more than 2 crore 
satisfied customers. A wide range of 
card products backed with superior 
customer service experience across 
the physical and digital mediums, have 
ensured that we continue to build 
momentum by issuing more than 5 
lakh cards every month.
Commercial cards which are used 
by various business entities to cater 
to multiple expenses around travel, 
entertainment, procurement and 
statutory payments have also been 
a key area of focus for the HDFC 
Bank payments business. With an 
experience of more than two decades 
of serving SMEs and large corporates, 
our payments business offers 
unique payment solutions for various 
industries like Aviation, Travel and 
Insurance. By leveraging advanced 
data analytics, we identify traditional 
payment flows and migrate them to 
a convenient and seamless digital 
payment flow thereby helping our 
customers manage their payments in 
a more efficient manner.
Our commercial payment solutions 
have found wide acceptance across 
the industry ensuring that we are the 
market leaders not only on an overall 
basis but also on an individual basis 
across multiple segments.
The Bank is a leading issuer of debit 
cards with more than 5 crore debit 
cards in force. The spend per card 
is 3x of the industry average thereby 
reflecting a healthy profile of the 
Bank’s customers.
In addition to credit and debit cards 
the Bank also offers a wide range of 
prepaid cards for use by individuals 
and corporates. These cards can 
be used across multiple merchant 
categories in India as well as overseas.
Our Acceptance Business which is 
spread across the length and the 
breadth of the country has been a 
significant contributor to the digital 
payments growth in the country. 
Over the last few decades, we have 
continued to invest and grow this 
business by ensuring that we onboard 
small, medium & large businesses to 
accept multiple payment form factors 
which includes Cards, UPI, Central 
Bank Digital Currency and Wallets.
Equipped with “Vyapar” our digital 
acceptance platform, we continue to 
maintain our leadership position in the 
acceptance business serving more 
than 30 lakh merchant establishments.
Our wide array of products gives 
us the ability to serve our merchant 
partners to collect timely payments 
through the offline as well as the 
online medium. Our product suite 
which includes Online Payment 
Gateways for collecting payments 
via Cards, NetBanking, UPI are well 
designed and not only suited to meet 
the needs of Start-Ups as well as 
large businesses but also cater to 
HDFC Bank Limited

the growing requirements of various 
associations, trusts, religious and 
Government institutions.
We also have the full array of products 
catering to our merchants partners 
enabling them to seamlessly collect 
payments in the offline world. We 
support collection of payments 
through the ubiquitous PoS terminals 
and are also a leading player in 
the UPI dominated QR payments. 
Our product range is flexible and 
complemented by latest technology to 
accommodate customisations.
Innovation has been a constant theme 
across the Payments Business. The 
Financial Year 2023-24 saw the Bank 
introducing several new products and 
payment platforms.
The Bank’s MyCards platform which 
is a one stop platform to manage 
HDFC Bank Credit and Debit Cards, 
FASTag and Consumer Durable loans 
continued to grow at a rapid pace, 
with more than 1.3 crore card users 
being added only in the last year. The 
platform continues to be enriched 
through addition of new features at 
regular intervals.
SmartHub Vyapar, an integrated 
payment, banking and business 
solution that caters to the daily needs 
of merchants and helps them drive 
business growth also continued 
to witness widespread adoption 
with more than 16 lakh merchants 
onboarded across the country. It 
handled over 45 lakh transactions 
daily in March 2024.
The newly launched PayZapp has 
seen a strong growth with 75 lakh 
customers onboarded as on March 
31, 2024. PayZapp provides a unified 
experience across contactless, QR 
and UPI payments. It is currently 
among the top-rated payments 
application in the country.
Given HDFC Bank's strong franchise 
on the issuance as well as the 
acceptance side, the Bank also 
leverages its network of consumers 
and merchants to enable affordability 
solutions. It has a very strong 
consumer finance programme helping 
consumers to purchase goods and 
services complimenting their lifestyle.
The Bank's future strategy revolves 
around the opportunities in the 
payment’s ecosystem and the vibrant 
Indian economy. It continues to focus 
on sustainable growth strategies, 
emphasising on resilience and holistic 
impacts. The digital strategy is aligned 
to enhance customer engagement 
across all touchpoints of the Bank.
As an extension of the digital strategy, 
the Bank is poised to launch a 
completely new and refreshed Mobile 
and NetBanking platform which is user 
friendly and offers a very high level 
of security.
Tech and Digital: A 
Customer Centric 
Evolution
The digital transformation witnessed 
in the financial landscape has 
brought institutions closer to their 
customers than ever before. From 
instant microfinance to the largest 
corporates and from the urban youth 
to agri and dairy farmers - our Bank is 
proud to offer best-in-class products 
and services to customers across 
the spectrum.
To further harness next-gen 
technologies and innovations for 
serving our customers better, we are 
pivoting our strategic direction with 
“Shift Right”: shifting from a product-
centric approach to a customer-
centric focus.
Our product-centric approach ensured 
that our core banking infrastructure 
was the heart of our operations, 
supported by layers of data, 
integrations and diverse channels and 
partnerships for customer interaction.
Now, as we embrace a customer-
centric model, we understand that 
Data enhanced with Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Machine 
Learning (ML)  at the core of our 
operations will enable deeper insights 
into our customers’ behaviour, 
preferences, and needs, further 
allowing customer personalisations 
and customisations while protecting 
their privacy and security.
The data would be powered by 
modernised, decoupled core  
systems built for scalability and 
demand with higher availabilities. The 
‘lightened core’ would leverage cloud-
native architectures delivering greater 
performance and secure access.
Next, an API orchestration layer  
will facilitate seamless integration 
and communication across services 
and platforms. This will ensure that 
our systems and services are always

cater to MSMEs in manufacturing, 
exports, retail and wholesale 
trade, supply chain network, 
infrastructure companies, farmer

liability and self-help groups under 
microfinance, commercial equipment

ready with plug-&-play connectivity 
providing enriched, streamlined

Further,  by supporting a variety of 
channels for customer engagement 
such as mobile apps, online banking, 
chatbots and in-person services, we 
can meet customers where they are 
and provide consistent, high-quality 
engagement across touchpoints. This 
multi-channel approach ensures that 
customers can access our services in 
the way that is most convenient and 
comfortable to them.
As organisations are increasingly 
taking their experiences directly to 
customers rather than expecting 
customers to come to them, 
Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS)  has 
begun assuming relevance. We see 
this as an opportunity to embed our 
digital offerings into the channels that 
customers prefer to use.
“Shift Right” will not only expand our 
reach and market presence but also 
foster innovation and collaboration 
within the financial ecosystem, 
ultimately benefiting our customers 
through a broader range of innovative 
solutions. By adopting a customer-

our services are more responsive 
and personalised while accelerating 
scalability, flexibility and innovation 
thus driving long-term customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.
Our dedication to delivering 
personalised digital banking solutions 
and ensuring inclusive access to 
banking services underscores our 
mission to be a trusted partner for 
all our customers. As we continue to

businesses. We are committed to 
resolving challenges such as limited 
credit access, high borrowing costs 
and collateral constraints that are 
faced by this sector. Our lending 
activities under this segment play a 
significant role in meeting our Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) obligations. 
The goals in CRB are three-fold: to 
increase PSL lending, to grow the 
book and to generate income while 
maintaining portfolio quality. Our 
Bank’s PSL lending comprises 53 
per cent of our total book of which 
46 per cent is organic. CRB Group 
has been clocking a y-o-y growth in 
the range of 25-30 per cent for the 
past ten quarters with a GNPA of 1.65 
per cent which is one of the lowest in 
the industry.
We have in place a robust growth 
strategy for all our major offerings. In 
MSME segment, we already have a 
strong presence across all states with 
a leading market share in 14 of them 
and securing a position among the top 
3 in 21 states. We are now building 
in granularity by targeting district-
level leadership.
We continue to pursue agricultural 
financing and consider the portfolio 
an important wallet generator for 
the Bank in the future. We see this 
potential, as trends shift from pre-
crop working capital financing to agri 
infrastructure financing. Further as 
envisioned, we have built a strong 
portfolio of diverse offerings across 
high income agri products such 
as dairy and horticulture. Under 
agriculture finance, we currently 
have a presence in 2.25 lakh villages 
and we aim to penetrate more in 
these villages to build further on the 
portfolio. We are currently the no.1 in 
the transportation finance business. 
While we continue to innovate and 
enhance our digital offerings, we 
have ensured robust analytics and 
risk management capabilities to back 
these offerings. Risk Management is 
at the core of our product offerings. 
Also, there are offerings in new and 
under-penetrated equipment category 
as well as non-equipment financing. 
We will do this by leveraging our 
strong OEM relationships, common 
distribution channels, geographies 
and customer base across our 
existing portfolio and presence. Digital 
journeys and digitalisation is a key 
enabler for growth in this segment. We 
continue to digitalise a major part of 
CRB business.
We are digitalising customer 
touchpoints, document collection 
processes, sales service and others. 
We have enabled self-service digital 
capabilities across all our branches. 
Going forward, we aim to build 
capabilities for digital underwriting 
through data management and 
APIfication. The segment that the 
CRB Group serves has tremendous 
market potential and the Bank is in a 
strong position to capitalise on this 
opportunity through our extensive 
reach, innovative capabilities and 
digital prowess.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
Retail Assets Strategy
The Bank has been the market leader 
in all the asset categories relating to 
personal finance and continues to 
maintain its lead position. It has been 
a combination of both secured and 
unsecured business. Our strategy 
involves a comprehensive approach 
to ensure sustainable growth and 
maintain impeccable asset quality. Our 
strength has been to continually look 
out for new opportunities and build up 
business propositions to cater to every 
segment of the industry. We have an 
array of products for both personal 
and business needs.
Our strategy is to continually enhance 
digital offerings across all our retail 
assets, do this at prices attuned to 
our risk appetite and consistently 
maintain our portfolio quality. 
We would continue our focus on 
digital distribution and increase the 
unassisted sourcing through Xpress 
Personal Loan, Xpress Business 
Loan, Xpress Auto Loan, Loan Against 
Shares / Mutual Funds. Introduction 
of new workflow system for Gold 
Loan, will bring in enhanced customer 
experience. We continuously strive to 
acquire New to Bank customers with 
our best-in-class asset offerings. Our 
indigenous digital journey not only 
enables our existing customers but 
also seamlessly propels business from 
New to Bank customers.
The large, existing customer base of 
over 9 crore provides a fertile ground 
for future growth. We would continue 
to provide products and offer solutions 
for customers’ needs based on our 
rich understanding of their profile. This 
would bring in higher engagement 
through our internal channels viz., 
branch network and virtual team to 
step up the business growth. Both the 
channels put together would reduce 
the overall cost of sourcing and 
improve our Cost to Income Ratio.
While we continue to innovate and 
enhance our digital offerings, we 
have ensured robust analytics and 
risk management capabilities to back 
these offerings. Risk Management is 
at the core of our product offerings 
with robust underwriting mechanisms 
in place to support our lending 
decisions. We ensure prudent pricing 
across all products factoring in 
the risk.
The Bank has expanded its branch 
network and we would capitalise on 
the same by increasing our offering 
and reaching emerging geographies. 
Our delinquency levels have been 
one of the lowest, with a large portion 
of the customers have better credit 
scores. Our robust processes and 
controls have managed the risk 
associated with varied asset lending. 
Our Gold Loan presence has also 
increased by 5X in the last 2 years.
As we move forward, all retail asset 
products would be made available 
to the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
customers thus enhancing our 
customer base. The way forward 
for us is to continue to offer loans 
seamlessly across geographies, 
expanding our reach in Semi-Urban 
and Rural markets for deeper 
penetration and maintain our 
leadership in urban areas and cities.
Home Loans
The merger of the erstwhile HDFC 
Limited with HDFC Bank has been 
transformational for the Bank. It has 
now emerged as a Bank with one of 
the largest home loan portfolios in 
the country.
A trusted home loan product is now 
riding on HDFC Bank’s network 
of over 8,700 branches, digital 
touchpoints, complete product range 
and superior technology. 
This synergy has enabled us to offer 
best-in-class home loan offerings to 
existing and new customers. Post-
merger turnaround time has improved 
significantly. This coupled with the 
erstwhile HDFC Limited’s strength of 
connecting with customers in person 
is a potential game changer in terms of 
both sales’ turnover and cross- sell.
The Bank is in the process of 
converting erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
service centres to branches in 
a phased manner. As a part of 
enhancing the cross-sell strategy, 
home loan customers are now able 
to avail of a wide range of products/
services like Deposits, Consumer 
Durable Loans, Credit Cards, Wealth 
Advisory Products, Unsecured Loans 
and other retail loans.
Savings Accounts for New to Bank 
customers has moved to about 85 per 
cent from 35 per cent. This sets the 
foundation for a stronger connect with 
incremental customers.
In addition to this, our strategy is 
to improve the focus on the self-
employed category which will 
further increase opportunity in this 
segment. Post-merger, the Bank has 
launched and expanded its product 
basket through banking surrogate 
programmes as well as leveraging its 
knowledge for better assessment of 
such profiles for home loans.
With differentiated strengths and 
despite having a larger book 
than peers, the Bank’s model is 
generating huge benefits on a monthly 
basis without compromising on 
its underwriting standards and is 
expected to generate substantial value 
for both customers and the Bank in 
the future.
The gross retail mortgages stood 
at H7,72,786 crore, compared to the 
previous year's H1,78,840 crore. The 
figures for the period ended March 
31, 2024 include the operations 
of erstwhile HDFC Limited which 
HDFC Bank Limited
62
amalgamated with and into HDFC 
Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence 
comparisons with the previous 
periods have to be looked at in light of 
the same.
The Bank believes that the 
fundamental demand for housing 
will continue to be strong in the 
long run in India due to a favourable 
environment. India is expected to 
have the largest working population 
by 2050, which is likely to give a 
major fillip to urbanisation in the 
country. Eight crore families are 
likely to move from rural areas to 
cities in the country, increasing the 
need for housing. This is clearly an 
opportunity for the industry and 
HDFC Bank is well positioned to help 
fulfill the housing dreams of millions. 
The Bank is committed to offering 
home loan solutions to diverse 
income categories.
Going forward, our aim is to retain 
and built on our strengths to offer a 
best-in-class service and capitalise 
on the immense opportunities that are 
available in the country.
HDFC Bank Edge for 
Corporate Cluster
Corporate Banking remains a 
steady contributor to our growth 
and profitability. Our customer base 
spans from prominent large business 
houses, multinational corporations, 
manufacturing and service sector 
companies to public sector 
enterprises and financial institutions, 
amongst others. Our focus is on 
holistic corporate engagement. We 
serve them by extending credit as well 
as by offering banking products and 
solutions that assist in managing their 
entire financial business cycle. Our 
corporate solutions include working 
capital and term loans at the inception 
of a project, operational solutions 
such as cash management, supply-
chain integration, international trade 
financing and payment solutions 
such as tax management as well as 
payroll management.
Our comprehensive range of 
products and services along with our 
relationship approach provides us 
with competitive advantage. While we 
focus on growth, we ensure pricing 
discipline and are selective in the 
exposures we undertake. We have a 
well-diversified book across multiple 
industries. The average rating of the 
book is between AA to AA+.
We endeavour to leverage our 
strong relationships with existing 
customers to increase our wallet 
share. This entails deepening share 
within existing products as well as 
designing effective solutions across 
their needs to increase their product 
holding. In addition, we are also 
focusing on New to Bank acquisitions 
through engagement with large 
corporates, targeting Government 
undertakings and multinational 
corporations to expand our reach. We 
aim to capitalise on the Government 
infrastructure push and Production 
Linked Incentive scheme (PLI) which 
will open up incremental opportunity 
for the banking sector. We have 
also put in place a liability strategy 
to improve wallet share through 
our transaction banking, viz, cash 
management, payments and trade 
solutions. Supply chain financing is 
also a key growth driver for the Bank. 
We are bolstering this through the 
use of technology such as our supply 
chain platform that acts as a one-
stop shop for transaction needs, as 
well as the development of need-
based offerings.

KEY GROWTH DRIVERS
We are continuing on a path of 
strategic digital transformation to 
further widen and deepen wallet 
share from corporates by enhancing 
Employee Experience (EX), Customer 
Engagement (CE) and creating an 
ecosystem for seamless banking. We 
are enhancing Employee Experience 
through the launch of platforms 
enabling an end-to-end journey for 
the Relationship Managers, actionable 
analytics, pricing intelligence and 
dashboard automation. On the 
customer front, we are progressing 
on the path of shifting from a product 
focus to an ecosystem approach and 
investing in enabling ERP integration 
across functions.
In addition to pure construction 
finance facility, we are also financing 
Greenfield under-construction 
commercial office space with 
developers having a proven track 
record. The construction finance 
facilities will get converted into low-
risk Lease Rental Discounting (LRD) 
facilities resulting in a healthy pipeline 
of LRD book for the Bank.
Through these initiatives, we are 
re-imagining the corporate cluster to 
function as a digital corporate bank. 
We believe the runway is long and 
our aim is to serve corporates with 
the entire gamut of products and 
services and capitalise on the benefit 
of synergies across our Bank.
HDFC Bank offers comprehensive 
structured solutions to help corporates 
make their supply chain more 
robust. These programmes cater 
to the working capital requirements 
by easing liquidity and removing 
the underlying trade risk of 
the transaction.
Supply Chain Finance (SCF)
As part of our digital transformation 
strategy, we have launched the 
SCF Underwriting & Onboarding 
platform to ease the anchor client’s 
counterparty onboarding process 
and provide instantaneous credit 
decisioning in less than 30 minutes of 
application submission. In addition to 
the enhanced Customer Experience, 
the platform also enhances the 
productivity of the Bank’s internal 
stakeholders. It enables HDFC Bank 
to build a granular SCF book and 
given the automation of the origination 
and underwriting legs, the platform 
is also expected to give an impetus 
to higher deal velocity on the existing 
SCF Transaction Platform.
Realty Business Finance 
Post-merger, the Bank inherited 
the realty business finance. It has 
commenced offering Construction 
Finance facilities mainly to well 
established borrowers with a strong 
track record. This business largely 
covers the rental discounting business 
as well as construction finance. There 
was a significant shift in regulation and 
processes. The Bank has successfully 
managed to ensure that the transition 
was smooth and seamless. There 
is a continuous endeavour to make 
borrower’s journey from application 
to disbursement smooth and fast. 
With continuous automation and 
digitalisation of various processes, 
we have been successful in reducing 
our overall TAT resulting in customer 
satisfaction and better service.
We offer funding for ready / under 
construction residential / commercial 
properties, Hotels, clubs, schools, 
hospitals among others. Lease Rental 
Discounting is another key product 
offered by Realty Business Finance.
HDFC Bank is the largest player 
in Real Estate finance with market 
share of close to 20 per cent. We are 
geographically spread across 15 cities 
across India and are present in both

Estate and related products.
There is an immense scope of 
providing other banking services to

provide them with services like CMS, 
liability products like Term Deposits 
and others.
Technological advancements and 
seamless end to end customer 
journeys are our key focus. Realty 
Business Finance strives hard to 
achieve this objective and play a 
pivotal role in Bank’s growth story 
and adhering to the mantra of 
‘Customer First’.

Digital Marketing
Digital Marketing plays a vital role in 
the Bank’s overall marketing strategy. 
Digital is a platform where increasing 
number of our customers spend their 
time and hence, it is crucial to be 
present in this medium to engage and 
build our brand with our key target 
audience. We have built a strong 
brand IP through Vigil Aunty – our own 
social media influencer, who creates 
awareness amongst customers about 
frauds and helps them to be aware 
of how to avoid them. She has 21+ 
lakh followers in social media and 
about 8 lakh on WhatsApp. This 
IP has helped us to strengthen our 
leadership position by taking the lead 
on an issue which plagues the entire 
industry. We also leverage social 
media platforms to drive moment 
marketing by celebrating key Indian 
stories, responding to trending 
themes and being present topically 
to establish brand associations of 
modern, dynamic, and progressive. 
Our digital marketing strategy has

IMPACT OF DIGITAL MARKETING
helped create brand love amongst 
the new and digitally savvy set of 
customers leading to increased brand 
awareness and brand loyalty for our 
financial solutions and services.
The second key aspect which digital 
marketing delivers on is to create a 
strong digital first culture amongst 
both the employees of the Bank as 
well as its customers. This primarily 
aims at creating frictionless customer 
experiences for availing our products, 
for taking care of their servicing needs 
as well as providing app platforms 
to manage their day-to-day money 
and payments needs. And then 
leveraging these digital journeys to 
shift the purchase behaviour of our 
customers to adopt unassisted digital 
journeys and save costs for the Bank. 
By executing this strategy, we aim 
to improve our direct contribution 
through digital to business generation.
We invest in advanced analytics and 
data science using cloud-based 
tools and advanced AI / ML models 
to gain a deep understanding of 
customer behaviour and preferences, 
curate personalised interventions and 
execute digital marketing plans at 
scale. We have revamped our digital 
journeys for loans, deposits and 
payment solutions enabling customers 
to purchase products in a frictionless 
manner. Our advanced analytics 
engine allows us to test hypotheses, 
build models and understand 
customer needs for meaningful 
interactions and relationship building. 
Our goal is to address relevant 
customer needs with the right product, 
at the right time and through their 
preferred communication channel.
To drive end-to-end outcome of 
unassisted business generation, we 
work in cross-functional teams called 
PODs. These PODs comprising the 
marketing, business and product 
teams are responsible for leveraging 
data-backed analyses to solve 
business problems. To implement

Nevertheless, the global landscape 
remains dynamic with major Central 
Banks closely monitoring inflation 
and economic indicators. Qualitative 
factors such as enhanced disclosures, 
robust codes of conduct and 
transparent governance structures 
remain pivotal for ensuring stability 
and trust in the financial sector. 
Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) has prioritised initiatives to foster

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
India Holds Steady Amidst 
Global Volatility 
The global economy is expected 
to maintain its resilience despite a 
tight monetary policy in 2024. The 
International Monetary Fund raised 
its global growth forecast by 10 
basis points to 3.2 per cent for 2024. 
It is expected that emerging and 
developing economies will experience 
a growth rate of 4.2 per cent in 2024, 
which is largely consistent with the 
4.3 per cent growth recorded in 2023. 
Conversely, advanced economies are 
projected to witness a slight uptick 
in growth estimated at 1.7 per cent 
in 2024 compared to 1.6 per cent 
in 2023. Certain Central Banks in 
advanced economies are expected 
to maintain higher policy rates for 
an extended period due to elevated 
inflation readings. Additionally, a surge 
in commodity prices including crude 
oil and disruptions in the supply chain 
amidst escalating tensions in the 
Middle East may impede progress in 
disinflation and present challenges for 
Central Banks.
India is poised to maintain its position 
as one of the fastest-growing 
economies globally in the Financial 
Year 2024-25. The Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) anticipates GDP to grow 
by 7.2 per cent in FY25, compared 
to 8.2 per cent in FY24. Economic 
momentum is expected to receive 
a boost from a further uptick in 
private capital expenditure and 
ongoing Government capital outlays. 
Additionally, the stronger-than-
anticipated global growth outlook 
augurs well for India's economic 
growth. Moreover, domestic 
consumer spending is expected to 
rebound especially in rural areas 
supported by a normal monsoon, 
stable inflation, and a reduction in 
interest rates. Domestic inflation is 
projected to average 4.6 per cent in 
FY25, assuming a normal monsoon, 
compared to 5.4 per cent in FY24. A 
favourable base effect and subdued 
core inflation (excluding food and fuel) 
are anticipated to lend support.
HDFC Bank has a robust risk 
management framework that helps 
maintain stability and resilience in 
its operations. It regularly conducts 
topical stress tests to assess the 
potential impact of geopolitical, 
macroeconomic and sectoral trends. 
The Bank continuously adapts its 
strategies and actions to enhance 
its ability to withstand potential 
challenges. Furthermore, HDFC Bank 
is dedicated to fostering inclusive 
growth by innovating and developing 
tailored offerings for the Semi-Urban 
and Rural market. The merger has 
further strengthened the Bank’s 
capacity to serve its customers 
and has opened up opportunities 
for cross-selling. Through these 
initiatives, HDFC Bank continues to 
contribute to India's economic growth

Focus on Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
In recent years, the banking sector has 
undergone a profound transformation 
with the extensive integration of 
digitalisation and cutting-edge 
technologies. This transformation 
has brought forth not only numerous 
opportunities but also formidable 
challenges particularly in the realms 
of cybersecurity and data privacy. 
The landscape of cyber threats 
has undergone rapid and complex 
changes fuelled by targeted attacks, 
the proliferation of Ransomware-as-a-
Service (RaaS) incidents, the utilisation 
of AI/ML to orchestrate sophisticated 
attacks as well as the prevalence of 
DDoS attacks and coordinated group 
cyber assaults. The repercussions of 
cyberattacks are profound, impacting 
not only financial institutions' bottom 
lines but also their brand reputation 
and customer trust.  
Moreover, these incidents often result 
in attrition and significant financial 
losses. As the banking sector 
increasingly adopts cloud-enabled 
services as part of IT modernisation 
initiatives and digital-first business 
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to robust cyber security and data 
privacy as part of our technology 
transformation journey. Key initiatives 
include the establishment of a next-
generation Cyber Security Operations 
Center, Advanced Security Incident 
and Event Management solutions 
augmented by AI and ML capabilities, 
24/7 defacement monitoring and a

related threats have intensified. 
Recognising securing the cloud entails

Growing Emphasis on 
Sustainable Financing and 
Climate Risk Management
The escalating impact of climate-
related events has prompted a 
heightened emphasis on resilience 
across sectors with the financial 
sector playing a pivotal role in 
mobilising resources for green 
activities. Climate change and 
transition finance have become central 
to global discourse.  
In addition, integrating climate and 
ESG related risks in underwriting 
policies and risk management 
framework is becoming increasingly 
important for financial services 
companies. The increasing threat 
of climate change and its physical 
damage are significant concerns that 
may impact portfolio performance. 
Shifting market perceptions and 
increasing demand for environmentally 
friendly products and services also 
have an impact on the cashflows of 
portfolio companies as the world 
transitions to a low-carbon economy. 
Effective risk management is essential 
to manage and mitigate these impacts. 
Moreover, inadequate information 
about climate-related financial risks 
can lead to mispricing of assets and 
misallocation of capital emphasising 
the need for a better, more consistent 
and comparable disclosures. 
Globally, the publication of IFRS 
Sustainability Standards in June 2023 
is a step in this direction. Aligned 
with global trends, SEBI introduced 
mandatory reporting of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR) for top 1,000 listed 
entities in India in May 2021. SEBI 
also mandated assurance on select 
metrics in the BRSR to further 
enhance the quality and comparability 
of ESG Disclosures. Additionally, 
RBI's draft disclosure framework on 
Climate-related Financial Risks in 
February 2024 focuses specifically 
on disclosures related to governance 
systems, risk management policies, 
and the strategies and targets 
developed by financial services entities 
to manage climate-related risks.
The Bank has conducted internal 
exercises to evaluate physical and 
transition risks arising from climate 
change. The Bank has developed 
initiatives to manage climate-related 
risks at the project, portfolio, and 
organisational levels. Further details 
on these initiatives can be found in the 
'climate related disclosures' section of 
the report.
Additionally, we actively monitor 
and externally verify the carbon 
emissions resulting from the Bank’s 
operations to manage and reduce our 
environmental impact. We also comply 
with all relevant regulations including 
those related to the BRSR, mandated 
by SEBI.

Regulatory Changes and 
Government Initiatives
The Government of India has made 
significant strides in promoting 
financial inclusion through the Pradhan 
Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). 
Leveraging the PMJDY accounts, 
the Government has effectively 
facilitated Direct Benefit Transfers 
(DBTs), streamlining the distribution 
of subsidies and welfare benefits. 
In FY24, transactions totalling 
H6.36 lakh crore were executed 
through DBT. Additionally, there is 
a continued focus on affordable 
housing with the extension of 
the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana 
(Gramin) in the Interim Union Budget 
for FY25, sanctioning additional two 
crore houses over the next five years. 
Concurrently, RBI also continued its 
commitment to promoting financial 
inclusion through the expansion of 
digital payment infrastructure and the 
introduction of innovative banking 
services. Further in FY24, RBI also 
implemented stringent licensing 
requirements and heightened 
scrutiny aimed at ensuring the 
sector's financial stability and 
responsible operations.
As a responsible Bank, we are 
committed to taking banking solutions 
to the remote areas of the country 
and enabling underbanked sections 
of the population to access formal 
financial channels.
With over 50 per cent of our branches 
located in semi-urban and rural 
(SURU) areas we ensure banking 
solutions reach the remote areas 
of the country and provide formal 
banking channels to the under-banked 
population. We are committed to 
the Government’s flagship initiative, 
Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana 
(PMJDY), along with other initiatives 
such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti

have revolutionised banking and 
finance sectors, driving innovation 
and efficiency. The rise of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning 
(ML) and Generative AI has 
transformed industry operations from 
asset management to fraud detection. 
Aligning with the Payments Vision 
2025, the Government of India is 
actively shaping payment systems, 
exploring alternate authentication 
methods and facilitating IoT-based 
payments. The introduction of UPI 
Lite X and conversational instructions 
enhances accessibility to digital 
payments and ease of use. UPI 
Lite X utilises NFC technology, 
facilitating seamless retail digital 
payments in areas with limited internet 
connectivity, reducing transaction 
declines and promoting financial 
inclusion. Additionally, conversational 
instructions powered by AI offer an 
intuitive and secure method for users 
to initiate and complete transactions 
through engaging conversations on 
smartphones and feature phones. 
Drawing insights gleaned from Kisan 
Credit Card (KCC) and dairy pilots, RBI 
alongside the Reserve Bank Innovation 
Hub (RBIH), launched the Public Tech 
Platform in August 2023. This platform 
leverages open APIs and standards to 
integrate services like Aadhaar e-KYC, 
land records, milk pouring data and 
bank account verification. It aims to 
boost lending efficiency, reduce costs 
and enable quicker disbursement 
and scalability. Additionally, the 
RBI's pilot programme for Central 
Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) now 
involving thirteen Banks nationwide 
demonstrates a commitment to 
fostering digital currency adoption. 
India's fintech industry is rapidly 
growing, projected to reach US$150 
billion by 2025 reflecting the country's 
emergence as a global fintech hub 
with over 2,000 recognised FinTech 
businesses. This vibrant ecosystem 
signifies India's rapid development and 
promising opportunities for innovation 
and expansion.
In an era of rapid technological

HDFC BANK'S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Risk Governance
At the apex of our risk governance 
framework lies our Board of Directors, 
responsible for supervising our risk 
management initiatives. They've 
set up the Risk Policy & Monitoring 
Committee (RPMC) to ensure our risk 
strategy is effectively implemented. 
The RPMC guides the development 
of policies, procedures, and systems, 
constantly assessing their suitability 
for our evolving business landscape.
Heading the independent Risk 
Management Group (RMG) is the Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO), who maintains 
regular communication with RPMC 
members. The RMG is responsible for 
executing the approved risk strategy, 
developing policies, procedures, and 
systems to manage risks effectively.
An executive committee oversees the 
nature and quantum of risks taken as 
well as risk management practices 
across the Group Entities.
Risk Frameworks and Their 
Implementation
Given the nature of our business and 
the regulatory landscape, we are 
exposed to a spectrum of risks. Among 
our principal risks are credit, market, 
liquidity, operational, cybersecurity, 
and technology risks. Moreover, our 
operations encompass compliance 
and reputation risks and ESG-related 
risks. To manage these, we've 
instituted an overarching risk appetite 
framework. We have implemented 
specific policies, limits, and triggers 
tailored to each risk category to 
operationalise our risk appetite for 
individual risk types. Furthermore, 
we've undertaken thorough measures 
to ensure proper measurement and 
management of risks inherent in the 
activities integrated through the merger 
within our framework. Our structured 
management framework, the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP), is designed to 
identify, assess, and manage all risks 
that could significantly affect our 
business, financial position, or capital 
adequacy. It helps us systematically 
analyse and address these risks to 
ensure the stability and soundness 
of our operations, protecting our 
business and capital adequacy from 
potential threats.
Ensuring informed decision-making, 
we regularly capture and report risk 
exposures, initiating appropriate 
mitigation measures. Additionally, we 
continuously refine our risk models 
to adapt to changing circumstances. 
To ensure independent evaluation, 
the Bank has an independent Internal 
Audit Department for assessing the 
adequacy and effectiveness of all 
internal controls, risk management 
practices, governance systems, 
and processes. 
We are intensifying our attention 
on non-financial risks by amplifying 
discussions within our Risk 
Management and Board committees. 
These discussions encompass 
compliance, personnel, technology, 
reputation risks, and others. This 
involves enhancing our policies, 
procedures, and risk assessment 
frameworks to effectively manage 
these risks, with an ongoing 
commitment to improvement. 
Furthermore, we are leveraging 
technology to automate our risk 
management processes, aiming to 
bring efficiencies, improve accuracy, 
enhance user control, and maintain 
thorough audit trails. By embracing 
technological advancements, we aim 
to strengthen our risk management 
capabilities while recognising the 
inherent risks in technology. Risks 
emanating from new-age solutions 
based on AI/ML techniques are 
comprehensively assessed through 
the lenses of Data Privacy, Data 
Security, Data Quality, Model fairness, 
and efficacy. The Risk Management 
Group independently validates relevant 
models across the Bank.

KEY RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES
Acknowledging the significance of stress testing in risk management, the Bank conducts stress tests beyond standard 
scenarios. We focus on topical themes influenced by geopolitical, macroeconomic, and sectoral trends to pinpoint 
specific areas of our portfolio. This approach serves as an early warning system, prompting potential actions. Various 
stress tests have been conducted to evaluate their impact on our portfolio and identify affected borrowers. Furthermore, 
we implement various measures to mitigate global risks, as detailed below
In the last year, the Bank has 
made significant efforts to protect 
itself from potential global banking 
crises. We've put in place a strict 
credit risk assessment process, 
conducting thorough due diligence 
and continuous monitoring of our 
loan portfolio. This approach has 
enabled us to identify and tackle 
potential credit risks promptly, 
thereby minimising our exposure to 
such events.
Throughout the year, the Bank has 
taken steps to manage risks linked 
to increasing interest rates. These 
include robust risk management 
practices, diversifying our asset 
portfolio, and maintaining strong 
capital and liquidity positions. We 
stay alert, monitoring interest rate 
movements and taking proactive 
steps to handle any potential 
shocks from rising rates. 
Recently, nations and market 
participants have increasingly 
sought alternatives to the U.S. 
dollar, exploring different currencies 
or payment systems. The Bank 
is closely monitoring the ongoing 
geopolitical events and shift in 
global trade patterns to take 
necessary actions.
As part of our risk management 
strategy, we've broadly assessed 
the impact of recent developments 
in the Middle East, including the 
conflict between Hamas and Israel 
and subsequent actions, as well 
as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and intermittent tensions 
between China and Taiwan. While 
we don't anticipate significant direct 
impact on the Bank, we're closely 
monitoring the situation.

RISK MANAGEMENT
At a broader level, risks from climate change are typically 
divided into:
• Physical risks -  Economic losses (physical damage 
to property and assets) from acute impacts on 
account of extreme weather events (floods, cyclones, 
droughts, landslides, etc) attributed to climate change, 
or long-term chronic impacts on environment such 
as rise in sea levels, increased global temperature or 
irreversible precipitation changes. 
• Transition risks -  The possible process of 
adjustment to a low carbon economy and its 
possible effects on the value of financial assets 
and liabilities including the likelihood of formation of 
stranded assets.
Mitigation
We actively support the financing and investment in 
environmentally friendly technologies and  
low-carbon infrastructure projects, leveraging our 
product offerings and financial expertise to assist our 
customers and clients in transitioning to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.
We are pursuing this through three thematic areas 
including ESG integration in products, sustainable 
finance and portfolio emissions. These are discussed in 
detail in the subsequent chapter on ESG strategy.
Strategies
We partnered with an independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for assessing climate 
transition risk at a counterparty level.
The Bank has initiated capacity-building programs 
to acquaint the Board and staff members with key 
developments in climate risk assessment.
Furthermore, the Bank has launched an internal 
pilot exercise to estimate financed emissions for its 
lending portfolio.
Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people, and systems or from external 
events. It includes risk of loss due to legal risk but 
excludes strategic and reputational risks.
Mitigation
The Bank follows a Board-approved Operational Risk 
Management Policy, detailing how operational risks 
are governed and managed. It details on a three-line 
defence system: the business line (including support 
and operations) is the first line, the Operational Risk

Key Measures Undertaken 
by Us to Mitigate 
Information Security 
Related Risks
Logging and Monitoring
The logging and monitoring 
procedures at the Bank entail 
logging user actions, system activity, 
infrastructure changes, ensuring the 
logs are securely stored and protected 
against unauthorised access. Alerts 
are generated for audit log failures 
based on asset risk levels. Monitoring 
tools aggregate log files, automatically 
reporting suspicious activity to the 
Cyber Security Operations Center 
(CSOC) team.
The CSOC team performs the 
following:
1.  Analysis and Incident 
Detection
  The CSOC team conducts 
analysis and incident detection 
by gathering information from 
system-generated events 
and other sources to identify 
potential incidents.
2.   Event Tracking and Escalation
  Events are evaluated according 
to their risk level and escalated 
as per the guidance provided 
in the Bank’s Incident 
Management Policy. This may 
involve referring incidents to the 
Cyber Incident Response Team 
(CIRT) for detailed analysis, 
forensics and management of 
situation awareness.
3.  Reporting
  The CSOC team periodically 
reports the events and incidents to 
the senior management.

Financial Institutions have an essential 
role to play in addressing sustainability 
challenges, facilitating the transition 
to a low-carbon economy, and 
stimulating sustainable development. 
There are increasing expectations 
for Banks to embrace sustainable 
practices from the perspective of 
borrower credit evaluation, making 
this a key focus area for regulators, 
investors, and other stakeholders. 
Moreover, financial products with 
environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) elements, such as green 
bonds and social bonds are being 
curated to satisfy the increasing 
demand for sustainable investment 
options. Additionally, Banks are 
also increasingly incorporating 
ESG considerations into their risk 
management practices, including 
climate scenario analysis and climate-
related stress testing. In response 
to the growing focus on climate 
change and ESG factors, regulatory 
bodies across many jurisdictions 
are also implementing stricter 
disclosure requirements.

India's Green Push
India is increasingly recognising 
the urgency of addressing climate 
change and the necessity for 
innovative financial mechanisms to 
support sustainable green initiatives. 
Projections from the Reserve Bank 
of India indicate a need for over H 85 
trillion by 2030 to align industries with 
climate regulations.
Recent policy measures aimed at 
promoting green finance highlight 
India's proactive efforts in this 
direction. One notable advancement 
is the Government of India making 
its debut in the sovereign green 
bond space, issuing sovereign green 
bonds worth H16,000 Crore in FY23 
and further increasing it to H 20,000 
Crore in FY24. Aligning with these 
trends, a jump in ESG investments 
by venture capitalists has been 
observed, signifying a growing 
interest in sustainable financing. 
Taking this forward, Banks and 
other lending institutions are also 
working to evolve their strategies 
to actively supporting clients' 
sustainability goals, streamlining 
green financing processes, and 
encouraging businesses towards a 
low-carbon future.
The Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI) has accelerated ESG 
transition by mandating reasonable 
assurance on quantifiable metrics 
for the nine principles of National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct for the top 150 companies 
starting in FY24 which shall be 
gradually extended to the top 1,000 
listed entities by FY27. Building on 
a decade of promoting sustainable 
development in banking, the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) has also intensified 
its focus on climate-related issues in 
the past years, demonstrated through 
release of a discussion paper, "Climate 
Risk and Sustainable Finance," 
in July 2022, and more recently 
through release of draft guidelines on 
climate-related financial disclosures in 
February 2024.
Our ESG Strategy
The evolving landscape of ESG 
integration in the Banking sector 
necessitates a holistic approach 
that encompasses ESG aligned 
decision-making not only for our 
internal operational practices, but also 
extending beyond onto our external 
financing activities.
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to aligning our strategy with global 
benchmarks. Our previously 
established Social & Environment 
Monitoring System (SEMS) Framework 
for credit risk assessment for financing 
large industrial/infrastructure projects 
has now been replaced by a detailed 
“ESG & Climate Change Assessment 
Framework”. This framework operates 
under the auspices of our “ESG Risk 
Management Policy”, for integration 
of borrower’s current ESG stance and 
climate transition plans in our credit 
appraisal process. As we progress, we 
are also engaging with our wholesale 
borrowers to understand their current 
ESG strategy and long- term climate 
transition plans, with a view to tailor 
our corporate loan portfolio towards 
climate-sensitive financing.
To strengthen our strategy for climate 
risk assessments and tracking 
financed emissions, we are proactively 
aligning our sustainability and climate 
reporting frameworks to increasingly 
integrate best practices and comply 
with the extant regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate. 
This keeps us abreast of the latest 
developments and practices in 
climate-related risk management, and 
serves as guidance to reshape our 
business model and operations across 
different geographies.
In managing our internal operational 
practices, capturing ESG performance 
data remains one of our top priorities, 
albeit a significant challenge. This 
challenge stems from the distributed 
nature of our operations and is 
compounded by the diverse formats 
for data recording and the sheer 
volume of data to be recorded. 
We continuously engage with 
stakeholders to communicate ESG 
requirements and refine our data 
collection processes to progressively 
enhance data completeness and 
accuracy to better align with various 
reporting frameworks and formats 
such as the BRSR, GRI, IR, etc., while 
obtaining external assurance for key 
ESG performance metrics.
Three years ago, we made a strategic 
commitment to achieve carbon 
neutrality on our own operations by 
FY32. We have, since developed 
and implemented a framework to 
guide us towards this goal amidst our 
expanding operations. The merger 
with erstwhile HDFC Ltd., in FY24, 
while unlocking exciting growth 
opportunities, has also prompted us to 
holistically reassess our performance 
milestones and adapt our course 
of action, ensuring that our carbon 
neutrality strategy remains aligned 
with this expansion.
To reduce emissions from all our 
operating locations, we continue 
to make informed investments 
encompassing operational and 
technological measures including IT 
capabilities and IT-enabled solutions. 
We shall continuously leverage these 
investments to optimise our data 
architecture and data governance 
practices, ensuring robust data 
collection strategies for informed 
decision-making.

CSR & ESG Committee of the Board. 
A separate ESG apex council at the 
management level, comprising senior 
members from various functions, 
reports to the CSR & ESG Committee 
and provides regular updates to 
the Board for annual review. This 
Committee is further supported by 
ESG Working Groups including the 
Environment Working Group which 
oversees the environmental impact 
from our operations; the Social and 
Governance Working Group which 
works on workplace policies and 
governance initiatives; and the Product 
Responsibility Working Group which 
looks at ESG risks (including climate 
risks) in the existing portfolio and ESG- 
linked opportunities.
We are in the process of setting out 
specific and measurable targets 
aligned with our business operations 
and portfolio to track and evaluate 
our progress, and report on the same 
to the CSR and ESG Committee 
of the Board through thorough 
consultations with ESG Council and 
Working Groups. We also intend to 
accelerate the scale and pace of 
delivering value by using collaboration 
as a mechanism to effectively foster 
strategic partnerships with solution 
providers, civil societies, government 
agencies that would help us bring 
together capabilities and resources to 
achieve our ESG objectives.

strategies in the form of enhanced 
environmental and social due diligence 
in lending and investment decisions 
thematic investing, ESG engagement 
and sustainable finance frameworks.
Directing capital towards sustainable 
projects allows us to integrate ESG as 
the fundamental determinant in our 
core lending strategy, and generate a 
positive impact through our business 
model. Being one of the key players 
in the banking industry, we recognise 
our role in facilitating the transition to 
a low-carbon economy. With our pan-
India presence and strong customer 
relationships, we aim to drive positive 
change by promoting environmentally 
friendly technologies and financing 
sustainable infrastructure projects.
We actively support the financing 
and investment in environmentally-
friendly technologies and low-carbon 
infrastructure projects, leveraging 
our product offerings and financial 
expertise to assist our customers and 
clients in transitioning to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.
The Bank has identified its products 
as one of the foremost business 
focus areas wherein ESG risks, and 
opportunities will be considered 
for improvement in systems and 
processes, taking into account 
the expectations from various 
stakeholders including investors 
and regulators.
The Bank is pursuing this through 
three thematic areas including ESG 
integration in products, sustainable 
finance and portfolio emissions. As the 
next step, long-term targets to strive to 
contribute to a more sustainable future 
are being set.
ESG Integration in Products
We have adopted a robust five-
dimensional approach for steadily 
incorporating ESG factors into 
the design, development, and 
management of our products with 
the aforementioned “Environmental 
Social Governance Risk Management 
Policy”. This integration is guided 
by our board approved ESG Risk 
Management Policy that overlooks 
assessment, management and 
monitoring of material ESG risks in 
our lending portfolio in line with global 
ESG / Climate Change assessment 
standards and practices.
“ESG Risk Management” framework, 
is a part of the overall credit 
assessment process for our wholesale 
corporate borrowers and has replaced 
the erstwhile “SEMS Framework”. 
This framework under the aegis of 
our ESG Risk Management Policy 
ensures thorough Environmental and 
Social Due Diligence of various loan 
proposals above the defined credit 
exposure thresholds, including direct 
customer loans (exceeding H 100 
Crore), wholesale loans (ranging from 
H50 Crore to 100 Crore), supply chain 
finance, offshore, and capital market 
loans (exceeding H50 Crore), as well as 
loans to banks, financial institutions, or 
NBFCs (exceeding H50 Crore).
For large project financing 
transactions, particularly those that 
are specialised and long-term, we 
conduct additional due diligence 
beyond the standard borrower-level 
assessment carried out in all Credit 
Approval Memorandums (CAMs). 
This involves the engagement of a 
Lenders' Independent Engineer (LIE) 
who evaluates various environmental 
and social aspects pertinent to 
the transaction. The LIE Report 
encapsulates identified risks along 
with suggested mitigation measures. 
Pre-disbursement compliance 
mandates the implementation of 
these measures, which are then 
continuously monitored throughout 
the project's implementation phase. 
Should any adverse developments 
arise, corrective action is 
promptly taken.
Under the revised framework, the 
assessment of ESG and climate 
change risks is also conducted basis 
borrower's overall ESG performance 
and climate change risks in relation 
to our total loan portfolio. This applies 
when our aggregate credit appetite 
surpasses a certain threshold, 
instead of evaluating each loan 
individually. The primary objective 
of this assessment is to evaluate 
the borrower's current position 
regarding ESG and climate change 
considerations so that we can analyze 
their transition plans and initiatives for 
mitigating risks associated with these 
factors. This assessment becomes a 
mandatory section included in Credit

The Bank has also been focusing 
on providing requisite training and 
capacity building to internal credit and 
relationship teams to equip them with 
the necessary knowledge on ESG and 
the assessment templates, to help 
them better evaluate these proposals.
Additional diligence for Large 
Project Financing Transactions
For specialised, long-term project 
financing, in addition to the above 
assessment which is carried out at 
borrower level in all CAMs, Lenders’ 
Independent Engineer (LIE) assesses 
various environmental and social 
issues related to the transaction 
and the various identified risks and 
suggested mitigation measures 
are captured in an LIE Report. 
Implementation of necessary 
safeguards to address potential risks 
is a pre-requisite for disbursement 
of funds. Post disbursement, these 
safeguards are monitored on an on-
going basis and corrective actions are 
taken where required.
Client Engagement
As the largest private sector Indian 
Bank, our role is to create awareness 
amongst our borrowers, thereby 
encouraging them to measure and 
disclose their footprint. This would 
eventually reflect in our Scope 3 
emissions and help us move towards 
a net-zero portfolio commitment. As 
a part of the regular credit monitoring 
process, Credit and Relationship 
teams regularly engage with 
customers to assess the operational 
and financial performance of the 
Borrower. Through this assessment, 
relevant issues on the environmental & 
social front are discussed. The impact 
of climate change on the borrower’s 
operations are also covered.
We understand that there are 
opportunities in transitioning to a net- 
zero economy, but the ecosystem (in 
the country) needs to be developed 
to take up such opportunities. The 
Bank has been engaging with its large 
corporate customers specifically those 
with businesses in “hard to abate” 
industries. The purpose of these 
engagements is to identify current 
ESG & Climate change related focus 
areas/practices and to identify best 
practices and emerging initiatives 
being taken by industry players on 
ESG and climate risk related issues 
including, but not limited to:
• Short term emission reduction 
targets and long-term net-zero goals
• Practices with respect 
to hazardous/ polluting 
waste management
• ESG & climate related disclosures
• Supply chain decarbonisation

The Bank has been sharing such best 
practices in wider client engagements 
with other borrowers in the same 
segments. ESG compliance and the 
impact of climate change has also 
become one of the areas of discussion 
in our regular customer calls/meetings 
with the customers. The discussions 
are expected to continue with different 
borrowers and best practices/
learnings from the same would 
be documented.

Related to ESG Compliance in 
Facility Documentation
As part of the Bank’s standard 
facility documentation, an addendum 
schedule has now been included, 
which comprises representations/ 
warranties/covenants agreed to, by 
the borrower on various ESG related 
issues. This schedule is included in all 
standard sanction letters.
Sustainable Finance 
Framework
Our commitment to enhancing 
our portfolio from a climate and 
ESG perspective is reflected in the 
development of our Sustainable 
Financing Criteria Framework (“the 
Framework”). This Board approved 
framework, is intended to issue green, 
social and sustainability bonds, 
originate loans, and use the proceeds 
to finance or refinance projects 
that are expected to facilitate the 
transition to a low-carbon economy 
and advance socio-economic 
development in India.
The framework aligns with the 
overall sustainability strategy of the 
Bank and is robust, transparent, 
and harmonised with the four core 
components of the Sustainability Bond 
Guidelines 2021 (SBG), Green Bond 
Principles 2021 (GBP), Social Bond 
Principles 2021 (SBP), Green Loan 
Principles 2023 (GLP), and Social 
Loan Principles 2023 (SLP). It aims 
to identify facilities within our credit 
portfolio where financing has been 
provided to borrowers in industries 
meeting sustainable lending criteria, 
categorising such credit facilities as 
either "green" or "social" facilities. 
Developed with guidance from the 
Bond Principles by the International 
Capital Markets Association (ICMA) 
and Loan Principles by the Loan 
Market Association (LMA), the 
Framework establishes eligibility 
criteria across ten green categories 
and six social categories.
It outlines a process by which 
proceeds will be tracked, allocated 
and managed. We are committed to 
reporting on allocation and impact of 
the use of proceeds - including those 
contributing to the advancement of the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals 2, 
3 ,4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13.

Environmental governance is 
essential for managing risks, ensuring 
compliance, enhancing reputation, 
fostering sustainability, and seizing 
opportunities in the transition to a 
more environmentally responsible 
economy. Our Board of Directors 
play a proactive role in environmental 
governance by setting the strategic 
direction for sustainability initiatives. 
At the management level, the ESG 
Apex Council is supported by 
three dedicated working groups- 
Environment; Social & Governance; 
and Product Responsibility. The ESG

Metrics and Targets
In alignment with the regulatory 
developments and stakeholder 
expectations, we continuously strive 
to identify material key performance 
indicators (KPIs) for reporting our 
environmental performance. We 
maintain a vigilant monitoring 
system for the identified KPIs and 
for the outcomes of new initiatives 
across all our operations. These 
KPIs encompass metrics related to 
energy consumption, greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, water usage, and 
waste management.
The valuable insights drawn from the 
monitored data are used for decision-
making and target-setting that propels 
us forward in our sustainability journey. 
We are expanding our reach by 
opening new branches, particularly 
in unbanked semi-urban and rural 
areas; this expansion necessitates 
increased investment in infrastructure, 
personnel and technology to fortify 
data collection across all locations 
– which remains an instrumental 
component of our progress towards 
our sustainability goals.
Three years ago, the Bank set an 
ambitious goal of achieving carbon 
neutrality on emissions from its own 
operations by FY32. Our recent 
successful merger and expansion 
is a significant achievement, which 
necessitates revisiting our strategy 
to ensure continued progress. While 
the FY32 target remains unchanged, 
the expansion has temporarily 
impacted data comparability between 
the current year and previous 
years – necessitating a potential 
adjustment to our interim targets on 
energy and emissions to reflect our 
growing footprint. 
Our Energy Performance
As a service-based industry, energy 
plays a critical role in our operations. In 
FY24, we consumed 3.03 million GJ of 
energy – which has increased by 1.06 
million GJ on account of our increased 
operational footprint.

Notes:
• Energy consumed from fuels include 
energy from consumption of petrol 
and diesel in company-owned vehicles 
and gensets. 
• For gensets and company-owned vehicles, 
petrol/diesel purchase data is extracted 
from the Bank’s financial records and 
the cost of petrol/diesel purchased is 
converted into litres of petrol/diesel using 
state-wise/national average rates derived 
from information in the public domain. 
• Electricity consumption from local grids 
is considered for (i) branches, offices 
and ATMs from financial records through 
spent based approach and (ii) data 
centers on actual consumption. Electricity 
consumption from renewable energy 
sources is (i) generated through in-house 
solar rooftops installed at 25 locations 
and (ii) purchased ‘green’ energy for 
12 locations.
While some of our operations do 
use fossil fuel as primary energy 
(such as in generators for backup 
purposes and in company owned 
vehicles), majority (83.59%) of our 
energy consumption is in the form 
of electricity (2.54 million GJ). Most 
of this electrical energy is primarily 
procured from the grid-although we 
continue to look out for sources of 
renewable energy (RE) to replace grid 
energy, wherever feasible.

recent merger, our rooftop solar 
portfolio has expanded. We have 
now commissioned a total of 25 
rooftop solar installations  (14 added 
as a result of the merger), with a total 
capacity of approximately 720 kWp,

progressive rules like "Promoting 
Renewable Energy through Green 
Energy Open Access Rules, 2022, 
and Promoting Renewable Energy 
Through Green Energy Open Access 
(Second Amendment) Rules, 2023, 
there remain a number of regulatory 
and market challenges for us to scale 
up our RE procurement. Several states 
are yet to adopt the Rules in the form 
of Regulations for implementation of 
Green Energy Open Access (GEOA) 
at the state level, hindering the pace 
of adoption of open access RE 
across our locations. We consider 
it crucial to eliminate these external 
challenges to enable at-scale adoption 
of green power across our distributed 
consumption centres.
Buildings Management and 
Green Buildings:  To support our 
decarbonisation efforts, we are 
actively engaged in reducing energy 
consumption across all aspects 
of our operations. This objective is 
achieved through a multifaceted 
approach, including the regulation 
of existing equipment, installation 
of energy-efficient alternatives, and 
the implementation of automated 
energy management solutions. Our 
comprehensive energy management 
and efficiency strategy encompasses 
various initiatives, reflecting our 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and mitigating climate change.
By leveraging digital systems and data 
analytics, we gain valuable insights 
into energy consumption patterns. 
Our focus extends to maintaining 
branches at optimal temperatures, 
improving power efficiency and 
automating energy-consuming 
assets. These initiatives enable us 
to optimise energy usage, enhance 
operational efficiency and reduce our 
environmental footprint.
In FY24, the Bank accounted for 
electricity consumption from all four 
of our co-located data centers. We 
are also implementing measures 
to increase the energy efficiency of 
our data centres which also leads to 
operational efficiency enhancement.

We have incorporated several changes 
within our infrastructure to improve 
energy efficiency through auto controls 
& environment-friendly equipment, 
and have installed centrally controlled 
energy management system in about 
568 branches across India as on date. 
This system has allowed us to control 
consumption patterns, resulting in 
savings to the tune of 16 per cent 
annually on an average. 
We are using technology and 
innovation as facilitators in our journey 
towards low-carbon growth. We have 
implemented elevator and equipment 
scheduling to reduce our energy 
consumption. We have also installed 
occupancy sensors, capacitor banks 
as well as Building Management 
Systems at several of our operating 
locations. The energy management 
modules with auto controls deployed 
across select branches have resulted 
in significant energy savings. We have 
also piloted the use of modular UPS 
in our branches and plan to scale it 
further. Additionally, all air conditioners 
in our new premises will conform to 
the latest standards developed by 
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE).
Moving beyond energy consumption, 
we have taken it upon ourselves to 
implement other green measures 
including waste and water 
management in our existing and new 
fit-outs. We intend to adopt a more 
holistic approach towards reducing 
our environmental footprint at our 
operating locations. As of March 
31, 2024, a total of 2,026 projects 
in different cities are certified under 
the Green Interiors Rating System 
of the Indian Green Building Council 
(IGBC). We intend to ensure that all 
our upcoming branches are evaluated 
for green building certification. 
IGBC's comprehensive rating 
modules encompassing Eco Design 
Approach, Interior Materials, Water 
Conservation, Indoor Environment, 
Energy Efficiency, and Innovation in 
Interior Design have been diligently 
implemented and met with excellence 
throughout our certified branches 
and offices. Additionally, some of our 
offices are also LEED certified. We 
prioritise environmental sustainability 
and have been using GreenPro 
certified materials such as plywood, 
laminates, flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, 
paints, adhesives, finishes, and 
equipment at our select locations. 
Additionally, we include low VOCs 
(Volatile Organic Compounds) finishes 
in our Bills of Quantity and contractor 
tendering process.
GHG Emissions 
We are dedicated to playing our part 
in addressing climate change and 
promoting sustainable practices not 
only within our operations but also 
throughout our value chain. However, 
collecting complete and accurate 
activity data from our myriad locations 
of varying sizes and nature, is one 
of our key challenges and hence 
a strategic priority action area for 
us. We are continuously enhancing 
our data collection processes and 
exploring suitable technological / 
automation solutions to collect data 
and enhance stakeholder confidence 
on completeness & accuracy of 
our inventory.
In FY24, our total Scope 1 and 21

77.33 per cent, and Scope 3 
emissions accounted for 9.70 per cent 
of our total reported emissions. 
In our ongoing efforts to enhance 
completeness of our GHG inventory, 
in FY24, we expanded our Scope 1 
inventory to include fugitive emissions 
from Air Conditioners (ACs) and 
Fire Extinguishers (FEs). Together, 
these two new sources contribute 
over 50 per cent of our total Scope 
1 emissions. Out of the total Scope 
1 emissions, fugitive emissions from 
ACs contribute 53.00 per cent, 
followed by emissions from fuel 
consumption in company-owned 
vehicles with a share of 23.93 per 
cent. Emissions from fuel consumption 
in gensets emerge as the third-largest 
contributor with a share of 19.21 per 
cent in the total Scope 1 emissions, 
followed by fugitive emissions from fire 
extinguishers accounting for a share of 
3.87 per cent. 
Our Scope 2 emissions encompass 
emissions associated with electricity 
purchased from the grid at all locations 
that are under the operational control 
of the Bank as well as our  co-located 
data centers. We are continuously 
taking measures to seek ways to 
reduce our Scope 2 emissions 
through interventions in our own 
operations and through collaboration 
with our data center service providers. 
We report our Scope 2 emissions 
using location-based as well as 
market-based approach as per the 
WRI GHG Protocol.
Electricity consumption at our other 
ATMs3, along with emissions on 
account of air travel, car/cab travel, 
train travel, paper waste, battery 
waste, and e-waste generated 
contribute to our reported Scope 3 
emissions that cover Categories 5, 6, 
and 8 as per the Technical Guidance 
for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions 
(version 1.0) by WRI Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol.
Our Scope 1 emissions increased

to 0.09 million tCO2e in FY24. 
This rise is primarily attributed to 
inclusion of two new sources of 
fugitive GHG emissions - ACs and 
fire extinguishers, apart from some 
increase on account of increased 
fuel consumption in company-
owned vehicles due to increased 
employee activity during the

In FY24, we witnessed an increase 
of 0.20 million tCO2e in Scope 2 
emissions despite 3,270.23 MWh 
of our electricity consumption 
having renewable energy attributes 
(generated from solar rooftop and 
procured through green tariff). This 
increase can be attributed to several 
factors including an increase in 
the number of locations under our 
operational control on account of 
merger with eHDFC Limited with effect 
from July 1, 2023 and our rapidly 
increasing geographical footprint to 
serve underbanked regions. Further, 
as a result of the merger in order to 
ensure uniformity across our reporting 
boundary, the Bank used a  spend-
based approach for estimation of 
procured electricity. 
We are using actual electricity 
procurement data for our data 
centers which contributes to 4.18

Measures to Reduce GHG 
Emissions
We remain committed to implementing 
meaningful and system-driven 
changes within the organisation to 
reduce the GHG intensity of our 
operations. Three years ago, we set a 
bold goal: achieving carbon neutrality 
for our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 
FY32. To that end, we have adopted 
firm-level guidelines for operations and 
procurement encompassing supply-
side and demand-side interventions; 
and established a carbon neutrality 
pathway to guide our progress, 
even as our operations have grown. 
The recent merger with eHDFC Ltd. 
presents exciting opportunities for 
growth, while also necessitating 
a strategic review of our carbon 
neutrality strategy. The observed 
increase in Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions prompts us to adopt 
a more holistic approach. We will be 
reviewing our baseline emissions and 
setting a new, post-merger baseline in 
alignment with base year recalculation 
methodologies of the WRI Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. This comprehensive 
review and realignment will allow us 
to continuously adapt and strengthen 
our efforts.

Notes:
• Scope 1 emissions include emissions from 
company-owned cars, gensets, fugitive 
emissions from air conditioners and 
fire extinguishers.
• Two sources of GHG emissions i.e. Air 
Conditioners and Fire Extinguishers have 
been included for Scope 1 emissions for 
FY 2023-24, which were not included in 
Scope 1 emissions for FY 2022-23
• For the computation of emissions from 
company-owned cars and gensets, 
emission factors from IPCC guidelines 
2006 have been applied to quantities 
deemed for energy consumption in ‘Our 
Energy Performance’ section.
• Fugitive emissions for fire extinguishers are 
estimated using operational database and 
public factors on leakage from USEPA's 
guidance, with GWP values derived from 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC 
AR6).
• For air conditioners, the Bank’s Fixed 
Asset Register for ACs sets the boundary, 
with asset characteristics derived from 
internal databases. Emissions have 
been calculated using India's refrigerant 
trends, average capacity of refrigerant as 
provided by vendors, refrigerant leakage 
as considered from Council on Energy, 
Environment and Water (CEEW) and 
GWP derived from IPCC AR 6. Scope 
2 emissions are reported using market-
based approach with grid emission factor 
from Version 19 of the Central Electrical 
Authority’s  CO2 database.
For Scope 3 GHG emissions, the Bank 
reports on the below categories:
• Business travel through air and rail: The 
distance travelled is estimated using 
sources available in the public domain. 
The applicable emission factors have been 
sourced from India Specific Air Transport 
Emission Factors, 2015 for domestic, 
Department for Environment, Food & Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA) 2023 for international and 
India Specific Rail Transport Emission 
Factors, 2015 for rail.
• Business Travel (Cab Hire): The distance 
is calculated using estimates of applicable 
taxi fares available in the public domain. 
For travel within India, the applicable 
emission factors have been sourced from 
India Specific Road Transport Emission 
Factors, 2015. For travel outside India, 
emission factors for average diesel cars 
from DEFRA have been considered.
• Emissions from e-waste, paper waste and 
battery waste have been considered. To 
calculate emissions, recycling emission 
factors and conservative emission factors 
for disposal have been sourced from 
WARM Version 16, EPA 2023.  For the 
computation of waste quantities, refer 
notes given under BRSR Principle 6, 
Essential Indicators: Question 9.
• Emissions from 'other ATMs' (i.e. electricity 
consumption for ATMs with no operational 
control):  Electricity consumption at these 
locations has been derived using internally 
derived benchmarks (i.e. Geo-climatic 
averages of kWh consumption from other 
offsite ATMs).

Our Carbon Neutrality Pathway Actions Taken in FY24
Demonstrating our unwavering commitment 
to environmental sustainability, we have set an 
ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality for our 
Scope 1 & 2 emissions by FY32. Our performance 
against our interim targets for FY24 is illustrated in 
the figure below. With our ever-expanding footprint, 
we acknowledge the challenges on our path to 
carbon neutrality.
While our ultimate target for FY32 remains 
unchanged, recent, unanticipated changes in our 
organisational structure have necessitated a review 
of our carbon neutrality strategy and its various 
milestones and levers. Therefore, we will be realigning 
our interim targets to account for our enhanced 
organisational boundary (following the merger with 
eHDFC Limited as well as the enhanced operational 
boundary (new sources of Scope 1 emissions and 
increased physical footprint). 
ENVIRONMENT
This year, we actively implemented our carbon 
neutrality strategy, focusing on both demand-side 
and supply-side initiatives.  While some measures 
were introduced later in the reporting period, we are 
confident they will translate to significant emission 
reductions starting in the near future.

ENVIRONMENT
As a responsible bank, we recognise our impact on the environment beyond our core operations. While we diligently address 
emissions within our operating boundary, we also acknowledge the importance of taking measures outside our direct 
operations. We have thus, prioritised two key aspects that have a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions within our value 
chain: paper waste reduction and tree plantation.
Our digital products 
and services, along 
with automation of 
several internal as 
well as customer-
linked processes 
and channels, 
have enabled us 
to reduce paper 
waste generation. 
The ‘Green Event 
Guidelines’ rolled 
out by our retail 
marketing team has 
helped save about 
58.09 lakh sq. ft. 
of paper during the 
reporting period.
We have launched 
an ambitious 
tree plantation 
initiative and 
have successfully 
planted over 30 
lakh trees to date. 
This program has 
not only resulted 
in significant 
reductions in our 
GHG emissions but 
has also served 
as a catalyst 
for enhancing 
our social and 
relationship capital.
Our digitised 
processes and 
products have 
helped customers 
reduce their 
frequency of visits 
to the Bank’s 
branches, ATMs, 
and offices - thereby 
reducing associated 
emissions.
Where paper use 
is unavoidable, 
we are switching 
to recycled paper. 
In FY24, recycled 
paper constituted 
7.07% of our total 
paper procurement 
which reduces the 
upstream emissions 
associated with 
paper procurement.
We made an eco-
conscious effort 
of responsibly 
disposing flex 
materials from 
eHDFC Ltd's 
signage transition 
to HDFC Bank. To 
prevent unintended 
reuse, we 
collaborated with 
signage converters 
to deliver all our 
6.76 tonnes of 
flex waste to the 
cement plants for 
environmentally 
friendly co-
processing, setting 
a pioneering 
example.

Waste Management
Our goal is to work progressively 
towards sustainable management 
of the waste generated from our 
operations. We are in the advanced 
stage of formalising the internal 
standard operating procedures for 
monitoring and reporting of waste 
generated as well as waste avoided. 
The roles and responsibilities of 
various functional departments 
have been defined to improve data 
governance and management with an 
aim to minimise waste generation and 
enhance the share of waste recycled.
As the first step towards improved 
environmental stewardship, we are 
progressively enhancing the quality 
and accuracy of our sustainability 
disclosures. This includes reporting 
waste generation and disposal by end-
use for various categories.

Notes:
E-Waste generated, recycled and disposed, 
includes IT related e-waste and data centers 
e-waste which is centrally managed and 
recycled through vendors.  
 From FY24 onwards, battery waste is being 
reported separately. Battery waste is centrally 
managed and recycled through vendors.
Paper waste majorly constitutes paper 
procured for the Bank’s own use and is 
shown as sector-specific paper waste. The 
quantity of waste generated is assumed to be 
disposed through other disposal operations.
Generation of plastic waste, hazardous 
waste, some quantities of paper & e-waste 
and non-hazardous waste are extrapolated 
based on actual data collected at select 
locations and the quantity of waste generated 
is assumed to be disposed through other 
disposal operations.
We recognise our responsibility and 
strive to ensure that all these wastes 
are disposed responsibly. 
Responsible waste management is 
critical to minimising our environmental 
footprint. This includes minimising 
waste generation, promoting 
responsible disposal practices, 
and ensuring proper handling 
and processing. 
We achieve this through partnerships 
with authorised recycling vendors for 
various waste streams. Furthermore, 
we are actively expanding our waste 
tracking program. Through internal 
consultations and collaboration with 
vendors, we will progressively track 
dry waste across more facilities over 
the next few years. We recycled 
109.74 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 
tonnes of batteries n FY24, all handled 
by authorised recyclers. 
At some of our locations, used diesel 
oil is produced due to the operation 
of gensets which is classified as 
hazardous waste and disposed using 
approved, authorised vendors.

Water Conservation
Reflecting the nature of our business, 
our water consumption is primarily 
for domestic purposes and drinking. 
We obtain water from municipal or 
third-party suppliers at most of our 
locations. Effective water management 
requires accurate assessment 
of performance data. We will be 
prioritising  measuring and monitoring 
water usage across our facilities, 
with a focus on larger sites first. 
This phased approach allows us to 
gather data, refine our strategy, and 
gradually expand meter coverage in 
the coming years.
As we continue to strengthen 
our systems for monitoring water 
consumption, we are also working 
on reducing our overall water usage 
through the implementation of water-
saving practices and technologies. 
In our IGBC-certified branches, 
all washrooms are equipped with 
low-flow fixtures and sensor-based 
urinals with a flow rate of 1 to 1.5 
liters per flush. Our total estimated 
water consumption5 for FY24 is 
approximately 4,81,615.63 kl.
The wastewater generated by the 
Bank is sent to third party.
Besides our operation, we also have 
an impact outside our operational 
boundaries by working with 
communities to conserve water and 
to rejuvenate water bodies. The 
details of this can be found in our 
‘Social- Communities’ chapter.

Climate Risk-related 
Disclosures
In response to the escalating urgency 
of climate change, various sectors are 
adapting to new regulatory landscapes 
to mitigate environmental impacts. The 
global fight against climate change 
has led to the advent of regulations 
like Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM). This has spurred 
India to create a regulated carbon 
market, paving the way for the Carbon 
Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 
under the Energy Conservation 
Act. This scheme envisages both, 
compliance and the development of 
a voluntary carbon market. Some of 
the operational guidelines for CCTS 
are currently work-in-progress. 
To navigate this new landscape, 
organisations need to reassess 
their climate risks and become 
more climate transparent. Global 
guidelines like the IFRS S2 standard, 
which subsumes the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) recommendations, present a 
framework for such disclosures.
Recognising the growing concerns 
of regulators, investors, and clients 
regarding climate risks, particularly 
for banks and financial institutions, 
the Bank has been reporting on 
governance, risks and opportunities, 
strategy as well as metrics and 
emission reduction targets linked to 
climate change.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has 
issued various draft guidelines on 
such disclosures, the latest one being 
the Draft Disclosure framework on 
Climate-related Financial Risks, 2024 
published on February 28, 2024.
We are continuously striving to align 
ourselves to make increased climate 
risk related disclosures.
Governance
Board Oversight
The Board of Directors have 
increased their oversight on climate-
related issues. The CSR and ESG 
Committee of the Board oversees 
the Bank’s sustainability and climate 
change initiatives. This Committee 
monitors the ESG framework, the 
Environmental Policy, actionables and 
initiatives strategised and executed 
by the management level ESG Apex 
Council and the ESG Working Groups. 
The Committee also maintains 
an oversight over the Bank’s ESG 
disclosures, highlighting the Bank’s 
ESG performance and prioritisation 
of material topics. A dedicated ESG 
vertical that works in conjunction 
with several internal and external 
stakeholders, to drive the Bank’s 
ESG agenda including managing, 
mitigating, and reporting on climate 
metrics. The Deputy Managing 
Director of the Bank has direct 
oversight on the ESG function and 
reports to the Board on such matters.
The Bank has initiated capacity-
building programs to acquaint our 
staff members with key developments 
in climate risk assessment. Credit 
officers assess overall E&S risks, 
especially climate risks through a 
comprehensive “ESG and Climate 
Change Assessment” framework, as 
a part of the overall credit assessment 
for select wholesale corporate

borrowers with exposures above a 
specified threshold as defined in the 
ESG Risk Management Policy.  
Further, the Bank has partnered with 
an independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for 
assessing climate transition risk at 
a counter-party level. The Bank has 
launched an internal pilot exercise to 
estimate financed emissions.
During FY24, the Board received 
regular updates on matters such 
as key government and regulatory 
policy, regulatory engagement and 
ESG matters including areas such 
as progress on our climate strategy, 
policy updates, industry trends, 
stakeholder engagement and target-
setting.
The Board members participate in 
dedicated familiarisation sessions 
to enhance their understanding 
of emerging climate related risks 
impacting the Bank and the adequacy 
of actions for management of 
the identified risks. In FY24, two 
meetings were conducted for the 
Board on emerging regulations and 
best practices related to ESG and 
climate risk management. The CSR 
and ESG Committee of the Board 
meets on a quarterly basis. During the 
year, the Risk Policy and Monitoring 
Committee also reviewed key risks 
and opportunities arising from 
climate change.
Policies and Frameworks Guiding 
Climate Risk Management
HDFC Bank’s approach to identifying 
climate-related risks, impacts, 
and opportunities is guided by 
the Board-approved ESG, Risk 
Management Policy (ESGRM Policy), 
Operational Risk Management Policy, 
Sustainable Finance Framework 
and the Environmental Policy. 
ENVIRONMENT
These policies inter alia inform 
the categorisation of risks and 
implementation of risk mitigation and 
management measures.
Specifically, the Bank’s ESGRM 
Policy addresses climate transition 
and mitigation plans and includes 
a prohibition list criterion and 
‘Category-A’ tagging of climate risk-
related vulnerable sectors. As part of 
this policy, we use our ESG & Climate 
Change Assessment Framework as a 
part of the overall credit assessment 
for certain wholesale borrowers as per 
the ESGRM Policy. Under this policy, 
the Credit Appetite Memorandum 
assesses ESG and climate change 
risks associated with the borrowers’ 
operations and mitigation measures/
controls.
The framework also captures various 
aspects of ESG compliance and 
climate change risks/mitigants in 
relation to the borrower, and their 
business operations. Through 
the framework, risk exposures 
are identified and reported to 
management, thus enabling the 
implementation of necessary risk 
mitigation actions.
The Board-approved Operational 
Risk Management Policy outlines the 
governance structure and processes 
for managing operational risk. This 
structure consists of three lines of 
defense: the business line (including 
support and operations) is the first 
line, an independent Operational Risk 
Management Department (ORMD) 
is the second line, and Internal Audit 
is the third line. The Risk Policy and 
Monitoring Committee (RPMC) of the 
Board oversees the risk management 
strategy of the Bank and ultimately 
reports to the Board of Directors.
The Bank had also implemented 
a Board-approved ESG policy 
framework, a guiding document 
for all ESG initiatives and activities 
undertaken by the Bank, focusing 
on climate change strategy, 
environmental and social risk 
management in lending, procurement 
practices, workforce and employment 
practices, good governance, and 
stakeholder management.
We have developed a Sustainable 
Financing Framework in line 
with International Capital Market 
Association (ICMA) Green Bond 
Principles 2021, Social Bond 
Principles 2023, and Sustainability 
Bond Guidelines 2021. This 
Framework, approved by the Bank’s 
CSR and ESG Committee, the RPMC 
and the Board of Directors, has also 
received a second-party opinion, 
concluding the credibility of the 
Framework as well as its alignment 
with global principles. This framework 
serves as a basis for the Bank’s 
on going and future Sustainable 
Financing Transactions (SFTs).
A Board-approved Stress Testing 
Policy and System, which is an 
integral aspect of our ICAAP (Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process), is part of our overall risk 
management framework. Stress 
testing involves employing a variety 
of ways to determine our vulnerability 
to excessive yet realistically stressful 
work conditions.
Climate risk stress testing captures 
financial impact of borrowers and 
associated credit losses due to 
physical risk and credit losses due to 
transition risk.
Committees Guiding Climate Risk 
Management
We have established a robust 
governance structure to oversee our 
ESG approach, comprising the CSR 
and ESG Committee of the Board 
HDFC Bank Limited
110
and the ESG Apex Council. Under 
the aegis of the Apex Council, three 
ESG working groups drive the Bank’s 
ESG agenda.
Our Board-level CSR and ESG 
Committee oversees sustainability 
and climate change initiatives, and is 
responsible for monitoring the ESG 
Policy framework, Environmental 
Policy, and other climate-related 
action plans. It ensures that the 
Bank’s ESG disclosures effectively 
communicate the Bank’s performance 
and prioritisation of material topics 
like climate change. The Committee 
reviews climate-related plans, 
targets, performance against those 
targets, and employee/business unit 
initiatives to mitigate climate change. 
Additionally, it allocates annual 
budgets for ESG initiatives. The 
CSR and ESG Committee convenes 
quarterly and discusses and updates 
on climate change initiatives and 
guides on further course of action.
The Bank has established a 
separate ESG Apex Council at the 
management level, that shapes 
and guides the Bank’s overall ESG 
strategy and provides actionable 
recommendations which are further 
reported quarterly to the Bank’s CSR 
and ESG Committee. The Council 
comprises of senior management that 
governs and reviews the progress of 
Bank’s ESG strategy and roadmap 
through three distinct working groups, 
namely Environment Working Group, 
Social & Governance Working Group, 
& Product Responsibility Working 
Group, and targets climate risk related 
governance across environment, 
social, and product dimensions.
The Bank’s comprehensive risk 
management is overseen by the 
Board of Directors. The RPMC 
is a Board-level committee that 
supervises the implementation of the 
risk strategy, has been formed as per 
the guidelines of Reserve Bank of 
India on Asset Liability Management/
Risk Management Systems. The 
RPMC monitors compliance with risk 
parameters and aggregate exposures 
within the appetite set by the Board. 
It also reviews the enterprise-wide 
risk frameworks viz. Risk Appetite 
framework (RAF), Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), and the stress testing 
framework for the Bank’s borrowers.
The independent Risk Management 
Group (RMG) maintains regular 
communication with RPMC members 
and is primarily responsible for 
executing the risk strategy approved 
by the Board. This entails developing 
policies, procedures, and systems to 
identify, measure, monitor, assess, 
and manage risks effectively. The 
RMG is headed by the Chief Risk 
Officer who is also accountable for all 
aspects of managing operational risks.
The risk management function of the 
Bank is independent from business 
and reports directly to the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive 
Officer. The risk management team 
conducts periodic topical stress 
testing to assess the potential impact 
of geopolitical, macroeconomic, 
and sectoral trends. The Bank has 
integrated ESG considerations into its 
credit appraisal and approval process 
for select wholesale borrowers. 
encompassing environmental, health, 
social, and safety risks.

Strategy
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to mitigating risks and leveraging 
opportunities arising from the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We endeavor to build our capability to 
manage risk from climate change and 
deliver our regulatory commitments, 
thereby demonstrating to our investors 
that the Bank is effectively managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities.
Identifying Climate-related Risks 
and Opportunities
Our strategy is underpinned by the 
way we assess and manage our 
exposure to climate-related risk. 
There are two main types of climate 
related risks:
• Physical Risks:  Extreme weather 
events like floods and cyclones 
can cause physical damage to 
property and assets, leading to 
economic losses (physical damage 
to property and assets). The Bank 
is assessing the potential financial 
impacts of these physical risks on 
the Bank’s operations.
• Transition Risks:  The shift 
towards a low-carbon economy 
may impact the value of certain 
assets and liabilities including the 
likelihood of formation of stranded 
assets. The Bank is exploring 
opportunities in green financing and 
sustainable infrastructure projects 
to mitigate these risks and capitalise 
on emerging market trends. The 
Bank has also partnered with an 
independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for 
assessing climate transition risk at a 
counterparty level.
Additionally, we have identified some climate-related risks and opportunities that the banking sector may face over the short, 
medium, and long term, as well as their corresponding impacts including:
Risk Type of risk Description
Current 
regulation
Transition risk 
factor
Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations 
are always integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current 
regulations are also factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the 
comprehensive ESG and Climate Change assessment framework for its wholesale 
corporate borrowers.
Emerging 
regulation
Transition risk 
factor
Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the 
climate policy, technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. This is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in 
loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and certain infrastructure sectors. 
Technology Transition risk 
factor
While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of 
our business today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology 
to have a significant impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use 
technology to enable business.
Legal Transition risk 
factor
For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental 
rules, failing to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the 
project goes into litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no 
other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit. 
Market Transition risk 
factor
In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in market repricing or 
shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in 
low-carbon digital products. However, the Bank recognises the relevance of change in 
consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this risk.

The Bank has also envisaged climate-related opportunities over the short, medium, and long term:
Opportunity Description Timeframe
Green services Expansion in demand for lower-emissions goods and services is expected 
to continue to scale in the medium to longer term. 
Medium
Lowering  
carbon emissions
Resource and energy efficiency in own business operations that help 
lower carbon emissions while also potentially strengthening operational 
efficiency is expected to scale up. 
Short
Greening of  
portfolio 
The diversification of the Bank’s financial portfolio and growth of green 
portfolio is expected to scale up.
Medium
Risk Type of risk Description
Reputation Transition risk 
factor
Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary risk to our business. 
We thus invest in community and customer involvement through surveys and structured 
engagements to educate and enlighten them on climate risks and mitigation. Further, 
ESG performance measures are increasingly being used by the global investor 
community, especially sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to assess long-term 
profitable growth. We strive to implement environment-friendly measures throughout our 
operations. We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate change, by 
including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report. In addition, in 
our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint 
(third-party assured).
Acute  
physical
Physical  
risk factor
Acute physical hazards such as cyclones, floods, and water stress can have a negative 
influence on the credit portfolio by causing bad debts, impairing assets or collaterals due 
to damage to property, infrastructure, and land, and interrupting operations. This is also 
relevant for climate disasters destroying assets (that serve as collaterals). The Bank’s 
Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams conduct business impact analyses 
and have rapid response procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as 
floods.
Chronic  
physical
Physical  
risk factor
Chronic physical risks are far into the future. Rise in global temperature more than 1.5 
degree Celsius may cause changes in climate patterns and sea level, impacting the 
economy and operations of the Bank, thus impairing assets or causing early replacement 
of assets. Given that climate risk is an emerging and long-term risk for the Bank, a 
suitable methodology/pathway shall be considered for adoption, to analyze the Bank’s 
exposures under different climate scenarios.
HDFC Bank Limited

Building a Climate-Resilient 
Strategy
By integrating climate risk 
considerations into financial planning 
processes, the Bank is building a 
more resilient strategy. This includes 
evaluating the potential impact of 
climate change on the Bank’s lending 
practices, customer base, and 
operational costs. The Bank believes 
that this proactive approach will help 
navigate the evolving landscape 
of climate change while seizing 
opportunities for sustainable growth.
The Bank actively reports to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), 
on its strategy that integrates both 
the potential risks and opportunities 
presented by climate change. We 
understand that climate change 
provides both risks and potential 
opportunities for our business. 
From the perspective of climate risk 
assessment, we plan on assessing the 
priority of physical and transition risks 
in the near to medium term.
We have a three-pronged strategy 
to adapt to climate change: 
decarbonising our operations; 
managing climate risk & financed 
emissions; and financing the transition.
Decarbonising Our Operations
• Minimising our operational carbon 
footprint is central to the Bank’s 
sustainability strategy. 
• We are committed to effectively 
managing and mitigating the 
environmental impacts of our 
operations by adopting industry 
best practices and standards.
• Our comprehensive Scope 1 
& 2 carbon neutrality strategy 
encompasses various initiatives, 
reflecting our commitment to 
sustainable practices and mitigating 
climate change.
Managing Climate Risks
• The Bank's credit exposure is 
well diversified across numerous 
industries, with no single industry 
having a high concentration. 
• We have strengthened the 
assessment of climate risks as a 
part of credit diligence, particularly 
in project financing above a certain 
threshold under the aegis of our 
ESG Risk Management Policy. As a 
part of this framework, identification 
of exposure for Category-A tagging 
sectors (business activities with 
significant adverse environmental 
and social risks) is underway. (Refer 
to the ESG Strategy chapter). 
• We are endeavouring to develop 
more robust frameworks to measure 
and assess material climate risks 
related to our lending operations 
and apply a climate lens to more of 
our business decisions.
• We are firming up an internal 
strategy on conducting climate 
risk assessments and tracking 
our financed emissions. The Bank 
shall continue to expand the scope 
of assessment, and refine the 
methodologies basis the finalisation 
of the disclosure frameworks in 
India, including the guidelines and 
timelines put forth by the RBI. This 
shall also help in the development 
of the Bank’s targets on financed 
emissions in the future.
• We have a Business Continuity Plan 
to address and manage continuity 
of critical business operations, 
ensuring accelerated resumption of 
services after a disaster.
Financing the Transition 
• HDFC Bank's Sustainable Financing 
Framework aligned to International 
Capital Market Association (ICMA) 
Green Bond Principles 2021, 
Social Bond Principles 2023, and 
Sustainability Bond Guidelines 
2021], serves as a basis for HDFC 
Bank’s future Sustainable Financing 
Transactions (SFTs), including 
green, social & sustainability bonds 
and loans. The Framework defines 
the eligibility criteria in ten distinct 
‘green’ categories. The policy is 
available on the Bank's website.

ENVIRONMENT
In addition to our three-pronged 
strategy, we also engage with our 
larger corporate clients as well as 
industry bodies and regulators on 
climate change. This enables us 
to strengthen our strategy while 
ensuring a well-rounded approach to 
implementation of the same.
Client Engagement
As a trusted financial institution, we 
continue to proactively engage with 
many of our larger corporate clients 
on both the risks and opportunities 
related to their businesses. To 
enable us to provide the appropriate 
advice and capital solutions, we 
also encourage clients to share and 
enhance their climate disclosures.
Through client engagement, our 
goal is to determine current ESG 
and climate change focus areas 
and practices. We strive to identify 
industry best practices and emerging 
initiatives on ESG and climate risk 
issues, including short-term emission 
reduction targets, long-term net-
zero goals, ESG and climate-related 
disclosures, and supply chain 
decarbonisation. Of the wholesale 
loans approved during the year, 26 
per cent in value terms underwent an 
enhanced environmental and social 
due diligence as part of the Credit 
Appetite Memorandum.
Industry engagement/
Government/Public Policy 
Engagement
We believe that industry co-operation, 
particularly in setting common 
standards and transparent reporting, 
is important for all our stakeholders. 
We continue to engage with peers, 
industry experts and academics to 
assess the transition to a low-carbon 
economy and consider emerging 
methodologies and taxonomies. 
We are member to a number of 
industry bodies and endeavor 
to advance our climate change 
policy through such industry/
trade associations.
We actively contribute to the 
processes of influencing the 
evolution of positions taken 
by trade associations through 
advocacy and negotiations. Our 
organisational strategy and climate 
goals guide our engagement with the 
trade associations.
The Bank also intends to accelerate 
the scale and pace of delivering 
value by using collaboration as a 
mechanism to effectively foster 
strategic partnerships with solution 
providers, civil societies, government 
agencies that would help bring 
together capabilities and resources to 
achieve its ESG objectives.
Risk Management
Risk Identification
Effectively managing climate risk 
requires proactive identification, 
a thorough understanding of the 
domain, as well as comprehensive 
inputs from stakeholders. At the 
Bank, risk identification is an 
ongoing process that includes the 
consideration of climate-related 
factors such as physical (acute and 
chronic) and transition risks in the 
lending portfolio. We are actively 
seeking opportunities to enhance our 
capabilities in identifying these risks 
and their impacts on our business and 
endeavor to incorporate additional 
climate risk considerations related 
to sector, product, and geography, 
aligning specific perils and transition 
categories, linking new and existing 
risks to other sustainability categories, 
and identifying the applicable time 
horizons for impacts.
Climate-related Risk 
Management
In line with its sustainability-
focused vision and commitments, 
the Bank has developed several 
initiatives to manage climate-related 
risks at the project, portfolio, and 
organisational levels.
Project Risk
At a project level, a risk assessment 
focused on social and environmental 
aspects is integrated into the Bank’s 
overall credit approval framework. 
The Bank’s ESG & Climate Change 
Assessment Framework, under the 
aegis of our ESG Risk Management 
Policy (ESGRM), ensures thorough 
environmental and social due 
diligence of various loan proposals 
above the defined credit exposure 
thresholds, including direct customer 
loans, wholesale loans, supply chain 
finance, offshore, and capital market 
loans, as well as loans to banks, 
financial institutions, or NBFCs. 
This assessment helps the Bank 
evaluate the borrower's current 
position regarding ESG and climate 
change considerations and analyze 
their transition plans and initiatives 
for mitigating risks associated with 
these factors.
HDFC Bank Limited
116
Portfolio Risk
The Bank has partnered with an 
independent, reputable global agency 
to develop a framework for assessing 
climate transition risk at a counterparty 
level. Furthermore, the Bank has 
launched an internal pilot exercise 
to estimate financed emissions for 
specific sectors in its lending portfolio.
Climate Risk Measurement  
(Portfolio level)
The development of methodologies 
and tools to link climate risk to 
traditional financial risk parameters, 
economic impact modelling, scenario 
analysis, and stress testing is still 
being progressively explored through 
global collaborations. Addressing 
challenges such as the availability of 
climate-related data (including the 
frequency of climate events at good 
spatial resolution, and regional and 
global sector impacts), regional climate 
impact scenarios, and comprehensive 
climate risk assessment tools and 
methodologies remains crucial. 
The Bank is committed to staying 
ahead of the curve and building 
capacity and understanding of the 
financial and non-financial impact of 
climate change.
The Bank undertakes stress testing 
and scenario analysis to assess 
the potential impact of geopolitical, 
macroeconomic, and sectoral trends 
on its portfolio and subsequently build 
its climate resilience.

At the Bank, stress testing involves 
the use of various techniques to 
assess the potential vulnerability 
to extreme but plausible stressed 
business conditions. The changes in 
the levels of Pillar I Risks and select 
Pillar II Risks, along with the changes 
in the on and off-Balance Sheet 
positions of the Bank are assessed 
under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and 
sensitivity factors. The suite of stress 
scenarios includes topical themes 
as well as historically observed 
geopolitical/macroeconomic/sectoral 
and other trends.
From the perspective of climate 
risk assessment, we are exploring 
third-party frameworks to assess the 
physical and transition risks in the near 
to medium term.
We intend to integrate our climate 
strategy and the impact of climate-
related issues into our financial 
planning processes, and to that 
effect, are developing processes and 
tools that will influence our business 
activities. We aim to:
• decarbonise our operations
• expand our green and sustainable 
banking products
• enhance the scope and accuracy 
of our climate scenario analysis and 
stress testing, applicable for the 
bank’s lending portfolio.
• monitor and estimate our lending 
portfolio related financed emissions.
As disclosure requirements and 
regulations continue to evolve, we 
expect to take these into consideration 
while developing our financial strategy.
As a Bank, we recognise that we 
do bear some responsibility for the 
environmental impacts of projects 
and entities that we finance. We have 
on a voluntary basis, commenced 
the exercise of measuring financed 
emissions of the bank’s lending 
portfolio. We are working with a 
climate tech startup to help in the 
assessment of measuring financed 
emissions based on our lending to 
various industries/sectors. We are 
testing the efficacy of India specific 
sectoral emission intensities based on 
Environmentally Extended Economic 
Input-Output models. 
On some of our corporate/ wholesale 
loans, it has been our constant 
endeavor to collect E&S information as 
per our ESG Risk Management Policy. 
While we recognise the challenges in 
collecting data on emissions, we are 
encouraged that a growing number of 
our wholesale borrowers are reporting 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 data.   
Financed emissions refer to 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions that are associated 
with lending and investment 
activities of financial 
institutions. As per the GHG 
Protocol, financed emissions 
are a specific category 
of indirect, downstream 
emissions and are classified as 
Scope 3 emissions. Financed 
emissions are critical to better 
understand the role of the 
financial sector in climate 
change. However, the lack 
of reliable and standardised 
India specific emission 
factors remains a challenge in 
measuring financed emissions. 
The Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) 
provides a framework to help 
financial institutions report 
their financed emissions. 
While the PCAF guidance 
varies across different 
asset classes, the broad 
methodology for corporate 
loans revolves around the 
concept of determining the 
financed emissions of a 
given exposure using the 
concept of an ‘attribution 
factor’ and then applying it 
to the estimated emissions 
of the underlying company 
or sub-sector. Further, PCAF 
guidance is available for 
only a few asset classes, 
which poses constraints in 
determining overall portfolio 
level emissions.
The PCAF methodology 
ascribes data quality scores 
from level 1 to 5. Level 1 data 
is where emission factors of 
the underlying entity has been 
verified by an independent 
third party. Level 2 data entails 
emissions that are reported 
by companies but have not 
been externally verified. Level 
3 to 5 data is where emissions 
are calculated based on 
production level activity or 
sectoral /proxy data.
Measurement of Financed Emissions: Pilot Study
HDFC Bank Limited
118
Based on loans of the previous year, we undertook a pilot study of a sample pool of 2,768 wholesale loans to 309 
listed entities disclosing Level 1 or Level 2 data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, across 34 sectors, which included 
certain hard-to-abate industries. Our reporting of financed emissions followed the PCAF standard for corporate loans as 
described below:
Using the above-mentioned PCAF 
methodology, the sample pool totalling 
approximately H1.5 lakh crore had 
financed emissions of 12.2 million t of 
CO2e. Although it is acknowledged 
that the exercise is backward looking, 
rather than futuristic, it still represents 
a significant milestone in the Bank’s 
journey towards measuring and 
managing its financed emissions. 
The exercise has enabled the Bank 
to identify variances based on 
actual entity-level data of Scope 1 
and 2 emissions versus applying 
sectoral level emission factors. This 
understanding shall help the Bank 
to establish more accurate baselines 
which will serve as the foundation 
for setting realistic and achievable 
emission reduction targets. Further, 
the Bank shall also continue to work 
towards widening its coverage for 
financed emissions, whilst also 
ensuring that it plays a role in being 
enablers of transition finance.
Organisational Risk
The Bank’s operations entail 
compliance and reputation risks, as 
well as ESG risks. To address these 
risks, the Bank has established an 
aggregate Risk Appetite Framework. 
Furthermore, risk-specific policies, 
limits and triggers are implemented 
to operationalise the appetites for 
individual risk types. The Bank 
recognises climate risk as a material 
risk. The Bank has a structured 
management framework called the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess, 
and manage all risks that could 
potentially have a significant negative 
impact on our business, financial 
position, or capital adequacy.
Metrics and Targets
We have taken on an ambitious 
target for achieving carbon neutrality 
of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
FY32 and are already aligning our 
operations to progressively stringent 
internal benchmarks for enhancing our 
energy performance and integration 
of renewable energy. (Refer GHG 
emissions section for further details).
Additionally, we aspire to fortify our 
commitment to financing climate 
change solutions such as energy 
transition, renewables, energy 
efficiency, sustainable transportation, 
green buildings, climate smart 
agriculture, among others, and have 
already embarked on a process to 
examine our financed emissions 
and carbon-related asset exposure 
with the intent to develop KPIs and 
track the progress towards assisting 
our customers in transitioning to a 
sustainable, lower-carbon economy.

CUSTOMER CENTRICITY
Service Quality Initiatives 
and Grievance Redressal
Customer Focus is one of the five core 
values of the Bank. Given a highly 
competitive business environment, 
especially with diverse lines of 
businesses, we continuously strive 
to enhance customer experience. 
Delivering exceptional product quality 
and customer service delivery is a 
prerequisite for sustained growth. The 
Bank strives to achieve this by seeking 
customer feedback, benchmarking 
with best-in-class business entities 
and implementing customer-centric 
improvements. We have adopted 
a three-step strategy regarding 
Customer Service - Define, Measure, 
and Improve.
HDFC Bank has adopted a multi-
pronged approach to provide an 
omnichannel experience to its 
customers. On the one hand, it has 
traditional touchpoints like Branches, 
Email Care and PhoneBanking. 
On the other hand, it has state-of-
the-art platforms like NetBanking, 
MobileBanking, WhatsApp Banking, 
the chatbot Eva and the Bank's 
exclusive social care handles. The 
Bank also has a Virtual Relationship 
Management (VRM) programme to 
cater to various financial needs in a 
personalised manner.
Customer service performance and 
grievance redressal are regularly 
assessed at various levels, including 
Branch Level Customer Service 
Committees, Standing Committee 
on Customer Service and Customer 
Service Committee of the Board. 
HDFC Bank has implemented 
robust methods to monitor and 
measure service quality levels across 
touchpoints including at product and 
process level, through the efforts of 
the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts 
regular reviews across various 
products, processes, and channels 
focusing on improving the customer 
experience. A unique Service Quality 
Index (SQI) has been developed to 
measure the performance of key 
customer facing channels based on 
critical customer service parameters. 
This SQI enables continuous 
improvement of initiatives to raise 
service standards.
One of the basic building blocks 
of providing acceptable level of 
customer service is to have an 
effective internal Grievance Redressal 
Mechanism/Framework. HDFC Bank 
has developed a comprehensive 
Grievance Redressal Policy, 
Customer Rights Policy, Customer 
Compensation Policy duly approved 
by the Board which outlines a 
framework for resolving customer 
grievances. These policies are 
accessible to customers through the 
Bank’s website and branch network.
HDFC Bank has created multiple 
channels for customers to provide 
feedback and register grievances 
facilitating a transparent and 
accessible system. As a pioneer in 
innovative financial solutions and 
digital platforms, it has witnessed 
an increased utilisation of its digital 
channels. Keeping customer interest 
in focus, the Bank has formulated a 
Board approved Protection Policy 
which limits the liability of customers 
in case of unauthorised electronic 
banking transactions.
This Bank is compliant with the RBI 
Internal Ombudsman Guidelines. At 
the apex level, as a part of the Internal 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism, the 
Bank has appointed seasoned-retired 
bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to 
independently review any customer 
grievance which is partly/wholly 
rejected by the bank before the 
final decision is communicated to 
the customer.
HDFC Bank is on a journey to 
measure customer loyalty through a 
high velocity, closed loop customer 
feedback system. This customer 
experience transformation programme 
helps employees to empathise 
better with customers and improve 
turnaround times. Branded as 
‘Infinite Smiles,’ the programme helps 
establish behaviours and practices 
that result in customer-centric actions 
through continuous improvement 
in products, services, process 
and policies.
The Bank remains committed to 
placing the customer at the centre 
of its operations. By consistently 
improving customer experience, 
adopting an omnichannel approach 
and implementing robust service 
quality and Grievance Redressal 
Mechanisms, it aims to build 
lasting relationships.

‘Infinite Smiles’
We, at the Bank, believe that 
delivering an outstanding customer 
experience is a strong differentiator 
for a great product and is key to a 
sustained competitive advantage. 
The primary aim of the Infinite Smiles 
programme is to establish employee 
behaviour and practices which lead 
to customer- centric actions and 
continuous improvements.

CUSTOMER CENTRICITY
In March 2020, we initiated 
measurement on key journeys, 
identified action areas to improve 
customer experience and implemented 
several key initiatives. This has led to 
a steady improvement on our NPS 
over the years. This year, we built on 
our commitment to our customers 
by scaling the coverage of our Infinite 
Smiles programme – we introduced 
new journeys, new episodes and 
new products ensuring a much wider 
coverage. Customer focus has seen 
increased focus - regular cadence 
with key stakeholders and rigorous 
follow-up on actions have become the 
cornerstones of Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses 
critical episodes – On-Boarding 
journeys, customer instructions, CQR. 
We now cover 140+ episodes and 
have contacted around 100 million+ 
customers in Financial Year 2023-24 for 
their feedback.
Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ program rests on 
three meticulously designed pillars 
– ‘Listen’; ‘Learn’; and ‘Act’ which 
enables us to embed customer- 
feedback led transformation as a 
discipline into our systems, challenge 
what is considered as the standard, 
and offer a customer experience 
that places us amongst the best 
service brands.
This well-defined System builds on 
the Score and requires every level 
of the organisation to be rigorously, 
consistently focused on the quality of 
customer and employee relationships. 
In order to foster individual learning and 
inspire front-line employees to do right 
by customers, we created an advocacy 
organisation that ensures
1.  Sustained Leadership 
Commitment
  Embraced the goal of creating 
more promoters and fewer 
detractors as a mission to building 
Service First Culture.
2.  Building Greater Focus on 
Understanding Customer 
Needs
  Operationalising customer 
empathy, through Detractor 
engagement; front-line 
employees hear positive and 
constructive feedback directly 
from customers enabling them 
to support actions that improve 
customer experience.
3.  Robust Operational and 
Analytical Infrastructure
  Customer Experience 
Transformation team leads the 
effort and is responsible for 
maintaining rigour. It rallies across 
departments to drive the mission 
of serving the customer and 
bringing voice of the customer 
into decision making.

4. Reliable and Trusted Metric
  We use Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) branded as Smile Score - a 
simple and easy to understand 
metric which is reliable and 
valued. We have now embedded 
Smile Score and customer 
feedback as an outside-in 
perspective for measuring 
process efficiency.
  Infinite Smiles program is a 
practical framework to grow 
by enriching the lives of our 
customers and employees. It is 
the business equivalent of the 
Golden Rule: Treat others as you 
would want to be treated.
  Guided by our aspiration to move 
from score to systems, we have 
been working to institutionalise 
the process for addressing 
Driving Customer-Centric Initiatives Through Innovation
HDFC Bank’s foundation is built on three pillars: technology, innovation and providing excellent customer experience. 
This philosophy has guided the Bank’s marketing journey over nearly three decades in driving key campaigns that 
focus on consumer awareness and education, offering innovative and tech first products and continually enhancing 
customer experience. 
The Merger of HDFC Limited 
with HDFC Bank 
The merger was successfully 
executed in-house, accompanied 
by a large-scale announcement

guidelines but a living embodiment 
of our values, beliefs and aspirations.

HDFC LimitedHDFC Bank
July 01, 2023 marked a historical 
moment for the Bank as we 
welcomed over 4,000 employees 
through the merger with erstwhile 
HDFC Limited. This was the coming 
together of two  iconic brands 
that  are known for excellence in 
their respective sectors. Hereon, 
it will be our joint responsibility to 
take the Bank to its next level with 
enhanced customer experience and 
an engaged employee ecosystem. 
On the people front, extensive 
efforts were made to assimilate our 
colleagues into the HDFC Bank 
culture and ethos.
An all employee Virtual Townhall 
was conducted by the Managing 
Director, Deputy Managing Director 
and Executive Director to warmly 
welcome our erstwhile HDFC 
Limited (eHL) colleagues into the 
Bank. Multiple Meet and Greet 
sessions were organised with the 
Bank Leaders and Senior Level 
Supervisors. The HR Business 
Partnering teams conducted 
multiple Orientation Sessions and 
Roadshows for eHL employees 
across locations. The focus was on 
sensitisation around Bank policies, 
processes, systems, culture and 
the way of working. A Grievance 
Committee was also set up for 
real-time support for addressing 
employee concerns and queries. 
The efforts have gone a long way 
in enabling people integration 
and assimilation, relationship 
building and over the year our eHL 
colleagues have got accustomed to 
the HDFC Bank Way of life.

SOCIAL – PEOPLE
Cultural transformation is an enduring 
journey marked by numerous small 
and big milestones propelling it 
forward. However, the critical success 
factor in this is Leadership Conviction, 
Sustained Commitment and Collective 
Action. We began this journey in the 
year 2021 and several initiatives over 
the last three years have been taken 
to sustain the momentum of change.  
20,000 plus people managers of 
the Bank who are the real Culture 
Champions were trained on the 
supervisory behaviour framework 
– Nurture, Care, Collaborate (NCC),  
to further strengthen on ground 
supervisory behaviours in line with our 
espoused Cultural ethos. Extensive 
investments on enabling, equipping 
and measuring managerial impact on 
culture have been made over the last 
three years. 
One such investment was the launch 
of NCC Leadership Dialogues .
Through this initiative, senior leaders 
from across the country engaged 
with employees sharing personal 
stories and anecdotes from their life 
journey that amplify our core values. 
These dialogues not only served as 
inspiration but also provided valuable 
insights into overcoming challenges, 
embracing resilience and staying 
hopeful.  
Additionally, we introduced 
an engaging and educational 
communication campaign, Living 
the HDFC Bank Way. This Bank 
wide campaign offers practical 
scenarios to illustrate acceptable 
and unacceptable behaviours. 
By equipping our workforce with 
knowledge and guidance they 
need, we are empowering them 
to lead the transformation in their 
area of influence. Culture is the 
collective behaviour of our 2 lakh 
plus employees  and it has been 
our endeavour to inspire them at 
an individual level to participate in 
this journey.

#Mind your Language NCC Short Films NCC Micro-experiences Evolve
NCC short films were 
conceptualised, scripted 
and enacted by HDFC 
Bank employees. The 
films picturise the negative 
impact of bad behaviour 
on team morale and how 
managers can correct 
the situation. The films 
encourage our viewers to 
adopt NCC principles as a 
way of life.
NCC micro-experiences 
is a communication series 
to guide employees 
especially managers in 
creating instant, realistic 
and meaningful micro 
experiences for their 
teams. The idea is to create 
a positive environment 
which will strengthen 
emotional bonds among 
team members and build 
stronger, cohesive teams. 
These micro experiences 
focus on the 9 practices 
of NCC and are shared 
with all employees on a 
regular basis.
Evolve aims at building 
capability of our people 
managers’ to effectively 
demonstrate managerial 
behaviours including holding 
performance conversations, 
using appreciative inquiry, 
bridging the generational 
gap at work and improving 
connect with new joiners in 
their teams.
30 second reels were 
created to explicitly 
articulate managers’ or 
colleagues' unacceptable 
behaviours @HDFC Bank. 
The reels reiterate the 
message that HDFC Bank is 
psychologically a safe place 
to work, where employees 
should feel valued, trusted 
be authentic.
Some of the interventions shared below are examples of various communication themes that were used during the year. 
We successfully launched Bi-
annual Culture Pulse Survey in 2023 
to assess the on-ground sentiment 
of employees. The survey broadly 
measured Culture parameters 
- Humility, Integrity, Inclusion, 
Nurture, Care, Collaborate. Over 
one lakh employees responded to 
the survey.
Vibes is a team-sentiment 
survey tool designed to measure 
employee experience with 
their managers in the Bank. 
Over 15,000 people managers 
received feedback from 1.16 
lakh employees.
Listening Architecture
Our Listening Architecture 
uses phygital platforms to 
conduct regular surveys 
and dipsticks gathering 
feedback to understand 
employee sentiment. 
This allows us to create 
tailored actions to improve 
employee morale and 
reinforce our culture.

Accelerated Journey 
on Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion
The Bank had a stated objective of 
reaching 25 per cent gender diversity 
by FY25 . Our active leadership, 
sponsorship and relentless effort 
on the ground has accelerated 
our journey towards crossing this 
milestone a year ahead of the targeted 
date. At the end of FY24, our gender 
ratio was 26.04 per cent, up from 18 
per cent in FY21, marking a change 
of almost 8 per cent in three years. 
This represents a more than 2.5 times 
increase in the number of women, 
from 21,746 in FY21 to 55,610 in FY24. 
We now aim to achieve 27 per cent 
gender diversity by FY27.

‘Great Place to Work 
Recertification’
The Bank has been certified as 
a ‘Great Place to Work’ for 3 rd 
consecutive time and we continue 
to focus on building our employer 
brand around the tenets of Pride, Care 
and Inclusion.
HDFC Bank has been consistently 
recognised as a Great Place to 
Work® organisation for three 
consecutive cycles, highlighting 
A. Intensifying Diversity Hiring
Diversity hiring was a key focus 
area for the Bank and this was 
seamlessly woven into our overall 
talent acquisition strategy. Throughout 
the year, we spearheaded targeted 
initiatives such as women hiring 
drives and specialised programs 
to reintegrate returning women 
professionals after career breaks. 
Our partnerships with all-women 
colleges and diversity partners further 
underscore our dedication to fostering 
an inclusive workforce. Innovation 
continues to drive efficiency and 
effectiveness in our talent acquisition 
function. With the introduction of AI 
powered hiring the attempt is to make 
our hiring process fair and unbiased. 
This has especially helped in our 
diversity hiring agenda.
We take pride in several ‘All Women 
Branches’  doing exceptionally well 
on customer service, compliance, 
performance and all other major 
parameters. This serves as a 
testimony to the fact that inclusive 
organisations perform better in the 
long run. Many of these branches 
are situated in deep geographies 
where they also serve as a lever for 
social change.
Building an inclusive organisation 
requires continuous effort of 
recognising and addressing 
unconscious biases and building 
support structures. Over the past year, 
we have focused on identifying high-
potential women in junior and middle 
management and actively guiding their 
career paths. This includes helping 
them take on higher-impact roles, 
equipping them with the necessary 
skills and competencies and providing 
visibility of opportunities.

B. Women Retention and Engagement
The Bank has developed various initiatives and supportive policy measures which would enable us to ensure higher women 
engagement, offer them career growth opportunities, thereby retain women and build the leadership pipeline. Some of our 
key initiatives include:
The ‘Broken Rung’ is a global 
phenomenon where diversity ratios 
across mid and senior levels in 
organisations drop significantly. This 
is because life-stage milestones often 
coincide with career milestones for 
women. In recognition of this, the 
Bank had introduced the ‘Pleasant 
Parenthood Program’ which is 
a slew of benefits for primary 
caregivers.  This includes flexibility 
options, rating protection, wellness 
support and manager guidance. 
These policy measures are now 
becoming a ‘Way of life’ in the Bank. 
The 'Career Accelerator Program' 
is our flagship initiative designed for 
mid-senior level women  in the 
Bank. Given its success, we continue 
to run this program to maintain a 
robust talent pipeline of women 
advancing into senior leadership 
roles. Over 200 high-potential 
women leaders have been part of 
the CAP journey across two cycles. 
Sponsored by the DEI Council, the 
program focuses on authenticity and 
self-awareness, building a leadership 
brand, executive presence, influencing 
and networking.
‘Stay interviews’ with select women 
employees across levels have helped 
us pre-empt support requirements 
and customise solutions at an 
individual employee level.

21st June -  
Inclusion Day for the Bank
This year, we marked our progress 
in the DEI journey by announcing 
the Bank’s Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion policy on Inclusion Day. 
The campaigns revolved around 
the theme "Respect for All" 
highlighting humility and respect as 
central pillars of our inclusive culture. 
Employees nationwide shared their 
personal stories on the meaning of 
'Respect' for them. On June 21st, our 
events featured notable speakers, 
including Mr. Sanjiv Mehta, Mrs. Zia 
Mody, Mr. Patanjali Keswani and 
Ms. Dia Mirza.

All the above actions have resulted 
in higher retention rates for women 
and significant improvement in their 
engagement scores. The number 
of women employees who reported 
a positive workplace experience 
has significantly increased over the 
years. The gap between employee 
experience of men and women has 
also steadily declined. This evolution 
underscores the Bank's commitment 
to nurturing an inclusive and 
diverse workplace.

Focus on Arresting Attrition
Post the pandemic, the BFSI sector had experienced a significant surge in employee attrition. It is also among the largest 
employers of a young workforce. Research indicates a notable shift in the younger generation's response to 'what you want 
from life’. This heightens our challenges in retaining young talent, especially on the frontline. However, in FY24 the Bank took 
up the challenge to arrest the trend and reverse it which involved a multi-pronged approach led by a Task Force at the highest 
level. The Task Force has recommended several actions which have been taken up for implementation.

Talent Acquisition
FY24 was, characterised by 
significant investments in building 
Talent Acquisition capability. Our 
efforts were centred on improving 
efficiency, ensuring diversity, 
enhancing multi-channel sourcing 
capabilities, optimising costs per 
hire and integrating advanced AI-
based technologies.
With a keen focus on sustainability 
and innovation, we have invested in 
building a fresh talent pipeline through 
strategic partnerships and job-ready 
models. For example, participation in 
the Future Banker 2.0 program has 
surged impressively compared to the 
previous fiscal year.
Gender diversity remains a 
cornerstone of our organisational 
ethos, seamlessly integrated into our 
talent acquisition strategy. Throughout 
the year, we ran targeted initiatives 
such as women hiring drives and 
the "Bank Again" program, which 
invited women ex-bankers to rejoin 
the workforce after a career break. 
We also have partnerships with 
several colleges especially in deep 
geographies. We maintained a gender 
ratio in hiring of 33 per cent in FY24.

Talent Management
The Bank further strengthened the 
Talent Management framework by 
leveraging a technology platform 
which enables access, use and 
recording of information in real 
time mode. We conducted talent 
reviews across various job bands 
primarily using digital platforms. This 
has aided our endeavour to build 
a strong pipeline of talent across 
various leadership and critical roles in 
the organisation.
On Talent Management, the Bank 
follows a process of assessing 
potential through tools like 
Development Centres at various levels, 
then reviewing Talent through Talent 
Review Councils on a performance 
potential matrix and then putting 
in place a development plan at an 
individual employee level for the 
identified talent. This year an additional 
psychometric profiling tool has been 
introduced for better understanding 
of employee profiles and assist in the 
career planning process.
The Bank continued to strengthen 
its succession planning process at 
senior levels in order to ensure the 
mitigation of Business Continuity Risk. 
Succession planning process focuses 
on providing employees with relevant 
role exposures, specific mentoring as 
well as coaching opportunities and 
addressing their identified learning 
needs. By doing so, the Bank ensures 
that employees are prepared to take 
up higher responsibilities when the 
opportunity arises.
HR Technology
In FY24, we continued to focus 
on investing in technology in the 
HR domain to ensure a seamless 
employee experience given the 
distributed nature of our workforce. 
This has helped create value for 
employees and the organisation as a 
whole. Deployment of critical talent 
processes across the employee life 
cycle across our large and scattered 
workforce has been enabled through 
technology solutions.

Learning and Development
The Learning and Development team 
at the Bank fosters a continuous

to deliver a world-class customer 
experience aligned with the Bank’s 
strategic priorities. This encompasses 
customised onboarding, functional

Our biggest highlight in the learning 
space this year has been the launch

we have partnered with global leaders 
in learning technology. The platform 
features the Bank’s proprietary 
content alongside a diverse range 
of material from top-tier content 
providers worldwide. The success of 
a newly launched technology platform 
is measured by its adoption. We are 
pleased to report that within the first 
30 days 86 per cent of our employees 
had adopted the platform, and by 
year-end, this figure rose to 98 
per cent. This is the highest adoption 
rate in the industry for an organisation 
of our size.
L&D collaborated with business 
teams to roll-out a range of 
learning interventions including 
product and process training, 
FAQs, toolkits, amongst others to 
enable a quick assimilation of the 
incoming employees.
All Sales and Associate Workforce 
joining the Bank undergo a structured 
onboarding programme called 
‘Swagat’. It is followed by mandatory/
regulatory modules on our learning 
platform. In collaboration with 
respective business teams, we also 
offered curated programmes on 
products, policies and procedures 
to strengthen their domain expertise. 
Additionally, theme based monthly 
learning campaigns were delivered in 
vernacular languages across various 
professional development areas.

Financial Year 2023-24
This year we conducted 
Impact assessments for our 
CSR projects with a budget of 
J1 crore or more.
The impact assessments 
considered the OECD-DAC 
criteria , which is widely 
regarded as one of the gold 
standards in evaluation 
frameworks. This framework 
assesses the project’s 
indicators by determining 
their Relevance, Coherence, 
Effectiveness, Efficiency, 
Impact and Sustainability. 
These criteria provide a 
normative framework used to 
determine the merit or worth 
of an intervention (policy, 
strategy, programme, project 
or activity). Other frameworks 
like the standard Outcome-
Impact Framework  was 
also followed to analyse and 
measure the outcomes and 
impact of the selected project 
by tracing the changes since 
the implementation of the 
project and establishing the 
causes of these changes.
In FY24, we conducted 
an impact assessment of 
61 projects. Based on the 
assessment findings, several 
recommendations were 
proposed for the evaluated 
projects to enhance their 
effectiveness & accessibility, 
and to strengthen their 
capacity to scale, deepen 
and extend the duration 
of outcomes.
We also conducted evaluative 
SROI studies of two projects 
within the overarching theme 
of ‘Skill Development and 
Livelihood Enhancement’ 
based on actual outcomes 
that had already taken 
place. The evaluation 
was guided by the seven 
principles outlined by the 
SROI Network. The findings 
and observations from 
this study shall be used 
to formulate future course 
corrective actions and a 
strategy for scaling up 
the project.

Rural Development 
As a cornerstone of our commitment 
to empowering marginalised 
communities, improving infrastructure 
and enhancing livelihood 
opportunities; we prioritise rural 
areas for the implementation of our 
programs. Currently, a considerable 
number of our initiatives are 
being implemented in such areas. 
Furthermore, we have ensured the 
coverage of 85 aspirational districts 
(out of the total of 112) through our 
CSR programs.
The World Bank defines rural 
development as the improvement 
in the social and economic 
environment of the rural population. 
The fundamental aims of rural 
development include planning, 
creating and using resources such as 
land, water and manpower to promote 
equal opportunity for the population 
reliant on them. 
Given this context, Holistic Rural 
Development Programme (HRDP) 
strives to enhance the lives of people 
in rural communities by primarily 
bringing about sustainable socio-
economic transformation and 
ecological development. HRDP 
adopts a comprehensive approach 
to sustainable development by 
integrating various interventions, 
ranging from Natural Resource 
Management, Education and 
Livelihood Enhancement & Skill 
Development to Healthcare. Targeted 
interventions for rural livelihood 
enhancement are also undertaken as 
a part of HRDP , including providing 
income-generating training for youth 
and women, creating alternate 
sources of livelihood such as livestock 
management, orchard development 
and promoting entrepreneurship 
activities like embroidery, masala 
making and toy manufacturing, 
among others. 
This program focuses on a diverse 
array of activities including but not 
limited to enhancing the income 
of farmers, access to appropriate 
irrigation facilities, improving school 
infrastructure, providing access 
to potable water and irrigation, 
and promoting alternative energy 
sources such as solar, biogas and 
biomass energy. Additionally, HRDP 
encompasses the organisation of 
health camps, demonstration of 
sustainable agricultural practices, 
initiatives for soil and water 
conservation and financial literacy. 
Furthermore, our Focused 
Development Program (FDP), which 
is aimed at specific interventions and 
limited goals, assist us in achieving our 
objectives in a concentrated manner. 
Under Rural Development, we have 
identified three key targets that we 
aim to achieve through our HRDP and 
FDP projects.

OUR GOALS
Reducing our carbon footprint
Our aim is to support 25 per cent 
of households in each village with 
solar home lights, biomass chulha, 
biogas plants, solar study lamps and 
irrigation units.
This intervention includes promoting 
biomass stoves as it improves indoor 
air quality and women's health.
We have surpassed our tree planting 
target, reaching 38 lakh, exceeding 
the initial goal of 25 lakh trees 
by FY25.
Promoting chemical-free 
farming
Our aim is to educate farmers on 
various agricultural techniques 
that improve productivity while 
using locally produced manure and 
fertilisers, to reduce the reliance on 
chemical fertilisers.
This intervention is designed to allow 
us to maintain the soil, environment 
and human health by combining 
tradition, creativity and science.
Bringing unirrigated 
land under irrigation and 
uncultivated land under 
cultivation
Our aim is to increase the area 
under cultivation and enhance 
the cropping intensity of the 
land, thereby bolstering the 
agricultural sector.
We are working diligently to increase 
the cultivable land pan India.
OUR TARGETS
Bringing land under 
cultivation
• Irrigate 2 lakh acres of unirrigated 
land by the year 2025
• Bringing 1 lakh acres of land 
under cultivation by the year 2025
Reducing the carbon and the 
ecological footprint of our 
communities
• 1,000 villages to have clean and 
renewable energy solutions

By focusing on improving land 
and crop productivity, providing 
agricultural training, enhancing 
health and sanitation infrastructure, 
and upgrading educational facilities, 
HRDP aims to build local capacities, 
strengthen institutions and 
introduce technological inputs. This 
comprehensive approach ensures 
sustainable development, better 
income opportunities, improved 
health outcomes and enhanced 
educational experiences for rural 
populations. The intervention under 
HRDP was implemented by our 
partner Aga Khan Rural Support 
Programme (India) and undertaken 
from April 2019 to March 2022. The 
intervention covered 12 villages 
across the Nandod block wherein 
the villages were selected for 
implementation because of their 
remote location near the border 
thereby making it difficult for any 
support to reach.

Based on the design of the 
HRDP program supported 
by HDFC Bank, a composite 
index has been developed 
called the Holistic Rural 
Development Index 
(HRDI) that indicates the 
achievements of the HRDP 
interventions leading to 
overall improvements of 
the results indicators. As 
the program interventions 
vary across projects 
and geographies, it is 
not possible to ascribe 
a single impact indicator 
that might be able to 
accurately capture the 
overall performance of 
HRDP. Thus, HRDI serves 
the purpose of quantifying 
the impact through the 
blending of results of 
various indicators grouped 
into four thematic areas 
namely Natural Resource 
Management, Skill Training 
& Livelihood Enhancement, 
Health & Sanitation and 
Promotion of Education.

In Biswanath, where diminishing 
rainfall and receding groundwater 
levels exacerbate water scarcity 
and deforestation, our initiative 
focuses on establishing sustainable 
water sources and promoting 
alternative energy sources like 
biogas units and improved 
cookstoves. Through village-level 
meetings and the construction 
of Jal Minars for water storage, 
we engage communities in 
the transformative process 
empowering them with the tools to 
combat environmental degradation 
while enhancing their quality of 
life. In Nainital, Uttarakhand, facing 
threats from declining glacial 
meltwater and erratic rainfall 
patterns, our interventions prioritise 
clean water provision, rainwater 
harvesting and the distribution of 
eco-friendly cooking solutions. 
Through meticulous needs 
assessments and transparent 
end-user selection processes, we 
ensure equitable distribution of 
resources, empowering households 
with access to clean water and 
sustainable energy sources. 
Meanwhile, in Khorda, Odisha, 
where uneven rainfall distribution 
compounds water scarcity issues, 
our project endeavours to provide 
clean water access through 
innovative water management 
techniques and promote climate-
smart agricultural practices like 
orchard development.

Awareness session for a Self 
Help Group at Samastipur, Bihar
OUR GOALS
Increase in Individual Income
Our aim is to enhance income with 
a focus on underprivileged farmers, 
youth, and women nationwide. We 
have devised three distinct sub-
goals to approach this in a targeted 
and methodical manner.
Increasing the income of small 
and marginal farmers
We encourage farmers to diversify 
their income by supporting them 
in allied activities such as livestock 
rearing, horticulture, timber and 
fishery, amongst others.
To achieve this, we are equipping 
farmers with contemporary and 
innovative farming tools and 
techniques by organising visits 
to various agricultural institutes 
and fields and providing them 
with seeds, fertilisers and other 
necessary support materials.
Promoting 25,000 Community-
led Enterprises
We encourage economically 
deprived communities to engage in 
entrepreneurship on an individual or 
cluster basis.
Development and Sustenance 
of Institutions
Our aim is the development and 
sustenance of institutions for 
livelihood enhancement, primarily 
community institutions such as 
village development committees, 
farmers’ groups, SHGs, water user 
groups, sanitation committees and 
adolescent groups. 
Under this intervention, the 
activities we engage in are related 
to agriculture, water, sanitation, 
health, livelihood and other rural 
development work.
Our interventions consist of 
establishing and operating enterprises, 
which include beauty parlours, 
small shops, livestock management, 
tailoring and more - for individual 
beneficiaries, as well as processing 
units, packaging units, fisheries and 
handicrafts - for group enterprises 
established through Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPO), Self Help Groups 
(SHG) and Joint Liability Group (JLG).
Skill Development for Employment 
Generation
Our focus is on skill development 
for employment generation and we 
are providing classroom/online/
blended skill development training to 
unemployed youth, school dropouts 
and landless farmers.
Our interventions include training 
programs which come with 
certifications from National Skill 
Development Corporation (NSDC), 
Sector Skill Council or other qualified 
non-government agencies and 
are aimed at trades that could 
lead to job placement or self-
employment opportunities.
Increase in Individual Income
• Increase in income of ~5 lakh farmers with an annual income under 
H60,000 across the country by the year 2025
• 2 Lakh individuals to be trained/skills upgraded
• Development and sustenance 
of 20,000 institutions by the 
year 2025
• Local economic activation with 
25,000 community-led enterprises 
promoted with approximately 50% 
being women-led

Healthcare and Hygiene
Our approach to healthcare and 
hygiene is comprehensive and 
multi-faceted. We provide essential 
healthcare services through initiatives 
like refurbishing health clinics, 
supplying medical equipment, 
conducting nutrition programs 
and health awareness drives. 
Simultaneously, we actively promote 
hygiene and sanitation practices in 
schools and local communities to 
create a conducive environment for 
good health and well-being.
Additionally, Waste Management 
remains one of our major intervention 
areas. We have been diligently 
working towards the goals of the 
Swachh Bharat initiative, with a 
particular emphasis on sanitation 
projects. These projects not only 
develop necessary infrastructure 
but also strive to foster behavioural 
change towards better hygiene 
and cleanliness practices among 
individuals and communities.
We are focusing on establishing 
dry waste management systems, 
particularly targeting Multi-Layered 
Plastics (MLPs), in collaboration 
with municipal corporations and 
block-level administrations. These 
efforts aim to enhance the socio-
economic conditions of waste pickers 
in alignment with the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2018 and Swachh 
Bharat Mission. 
Furthermore, we are institutionalising 
waste pickers in Swachh Centres 
(SCs)/MRFs and ULBs for long-
term solutions, thereby contributing 
to sustainable waste management 
practices. Through our initiatives, 
we are also generating awareness 
and mobilising communities for safe 
plastic disposal, emphasising the 
importance of responsible waste 
management for environmental and 
public health benefits.
Under this thematic area of Healthcare 
and Hygiene, our objective is to 
enhance the standard of sanitation 
facilities. Our efforts towards achieving 
this objective are directed towards 
three distinct sub-goals, namely 
waste management, access to 
clean drinking water and creating 
hygiene awareness.

Facility in Bastar, Chhattisgarh
OUR GOALS
Access to Clean Drinking Water
We aim to promote clean drinking water availability at 
both the community level through Jal-minar or other 
water buildings, and at the family level, through piped 
water connections.
Our interventions will result in making three litres of water 
available per person per day. We are also forming and 
orienting water user groups to ensure that the services 
are sustainable, with post-project maintenance and water 
quality testing entrusted to these groups.
Waste Management
We aim to provide the necessary infrastructure, instilling 
behavioural changes towards responsible consumption, 
source segregation and litter prevention. 
Our interventions include setting up material recovery and

Transforming Communities: Innovative Plastic Management Initiatives
In Golaghat District of Assam, our 
collaboration with Gramin Vikas 
Trust resulted in the establishment 
of a state of the art Plastic Waste 
Management Unit. This initiative, 
equipped with innovative features 
like wastewater utilisation for fisheries 
has not only tackled immediate 
waste management needs but also 
laid the foundation for a sustainable 
future through collaborative efforts 
with local administrations and 
educational institutions.
Expanding our footprint across 
states like Assam, Bihar and 
Telangana, we partnered with 
organisations like the Centre for 
Environment Education (CEE) to 
implement comprehensive dry 
waste management projects. These 
initiatives, ranging from establishing 
Swachh Centres to enhancing 
the socio-economic conditions 
of waste pickers highlight the 
scale of our impact in mitigating 
environmental degradation.
Additionally, in locations like 
Dharamshala and Bir in the state of

with the Central Government's 
flagship initiative, Jal Jeevan 
Mission (JJM) - ‘Har Ghar Nal 
se Jal’, focused on ‘improving 
access to safe water among 
target communities by 
facilitating the construction of 
water supply services, capacity 
building of communities to 
plan and manage their water 
demand and ultimately ensure 
sustainability.’
The project was implemented by the 
Aga Khan Foundation, an NGO which 
was supported by HDFC Bank. 
The key goal of the project was to 
accomplish the target of delivering 
potable water via tap connections. 
Over 60 per cent of the project

SOCIAL - COMMUNITY
Financial Literacy  
and Inclusion
In India, a significant portion of the 
population remains excluded from the 
formal economy, missing out on its 
advantages. Without basic financial 
literacy and inclusion, communities 
struggle to progress and engage with 
the broader world. Recognising this 
pressing need, we are committed 
to addressing financial exclusion by 
reaching out to the unbanked and 
under-banked populations in rural, 
semi-urban and urban areas across 
the country. As part of this effort, 
the Bank considers it a responsibility 
to promote financial awareness, 
particularly among marginalised 
sections of society, through 
various initiatives.
Additionally, we conduct financial 
literacy camps and support Self-Help 
Groups (SHGs) to promote financial 
awareness within communities. 
The primary objective of these 
initiatives is to empower individuals 
with the necessary knowledge to 
make informed decisions about their 
finances, thereby enhancing their 
financial well-being.
Dairy Support
The dairy support program 
is instrumental in facilitating a 
substantial shift in the payment 
methods of farmers, moving from 
cash transactions to digital banking. 
This transition effectively addresses 
the challenges associated with 
managing payments in the dairy 
sector and navigating a farmer 
in mainstream banking services. 
Women play a significant role in the 
dairy sector, contributing to various 
aspects of production, processing 
and management. In many states, 
women are actively involved in milking 
cows, feeding livestock, and ensuring 
animal health.
This project is vital to rural 
development & financial inclusion, 
playing a key role in advancing 
the progress and sustainability of 
the rural economy. This project 
further emphasises the larger CSR 
objective of Women Empowerment 
and facilitating their social and 
economic standard.
By fostering credit history and 
embracing digitisation, this program 
significantly elevates banking services 
for dairy farmers. This will also help in 
promoting healthy savings habits in 
farmers which is ultimately contributing 
to financial inclusion for the rural 
economy. Encouraging regular 
deposits, setting achievable savings 
goals and utilising interest-bearing 
accounts are effective strategies to 
build savings over time. By educating 
farmers on the importance of saving 
and providing access to financial 
services in rural areas, we can 
empower communities to secure their 
financial futures and participate more 
fully in the economy.

Dedicated to the 
Nation’s Progress
HDFC Bank actively collaborates with various tiers of 
Government to support its nation-building initiatives. By 
partnering with central, state and local authorities, the 
Bank aids in the efficient collection of diverse revenue 
receipts and the disbursement of welfare schemes. 
Furthermore, HDFC Bank is committed to fuelling the 
growth of the Start-Up ecosystem and actively participates 
in the Government's efforts to foster financial inclusion.
NATION BUILDING
Collecting Taxes
HDFC Bank is one among the top 
three Agency Banks, according to 
data reported by the Press Information 
Bureau and Controller General of 
Accounts, Government of India. An 
area where the Bank has significantly 
stepped–up collections for the 
exchequer is e-freight services. 
Collections grew by 25 times as 
compared to the previous year.
Tax collections through the Bank 
witnessed a 6 per cent growth as 
compared to FY23 and crossed 10 
lakh crore in FY24.
The Bank’s leading position in the 
collection of taxes demonstrates its 
large customer base, wide distribution 
and strong commitment to leveraging 
its strengths to contribute to the overall 
development of the nation.
To enable collection of taxes, the 
Bank is integrated with various central 
Government systems including TIN 2.0 
(Direct Tax), GSTN, ICEGATE (Custom 
Duties) and FOIS. Further, HDFC Bank 
is also integrated with the upgraded 
version of the ICEGATE platform for 
custom duty collections.

Enabling Infrastructure Development
The Government of India is focused on building infrastructure to fuel growth. The Bank works closely with Government 
agencies that drive such development efforts. It enables these Government entities to centrally monitor such projects for 
timely completion and disbursement of payments linked to delivery milestones. This has helped reduce delays and minimise 
cost overruns. 
Digitalise Land 
Acquisition
Online Collection 
of Lease Rentals
Streamline 
Finances
Integration with 
the Government’s 
Auction Platform
Availability of land 
is a key prerequisite 
for infrastructure 
development. The Bank 
has helped digitalise 
land acquisition as well 
as the compensation 
process for those 
affected by the project.
The Bank has also 
helped in the digital 
transformation of the 
Dedicated Freight 
Corridor Corporation of 
India. It has helped the 
entity to streamline its 
finances and simplify 
payments to vendors.
To increase the 
efficiency of revenue 
collection from services 
linked to national 
highways like food-
courts and petrol- 
pumps, the Bank has 
worked with National 
Highways Logistics 
Management Limited (a 
wholly owned subsidiary 
of National Highways 
Authority of India) to 
facilitate online collection 
of lease rentals from 
such service providers. 
The Bank’s collection 
channels like payment 
gateways have been 
integrated with the 
Government’s auction 
platform to help 
monetise its assets. 
Assets worth over 
H20,000 crores were 
auctioned last year.
Further the Bank has completed 
integration with the PRAKALP Portal 
(Pratyaksh Kar Lekhankan Pranali), a 
system introduced by the Ministry of 
Finance for reporting of direct taxes 
collected by banks. This is key for 
the Government since the PRAKALP 
portal helps it optimise utilisation of the 
collected funds and therefore minimise 
its borrowings.
The Bank has also integrated with 
eSampark centres in Chandigarh 
which enables collection of tax 
through multiple modes across 
47 centres.
Digitalising Local 
Administration
HDFC Bank has continued to drive 
digitalisation of local administration 
by enabling tax collections for local 
bodies and Gram Panchayats.
The Bank has aligned to the 
Government’s Smart City Mission by 
integrating with Smart City Mobile 
Apps. This has accelerated local 
tax collections by delivering 24x7 
availability of payment channels to 
its citizens.
Gram Panchayats play a crucial 
role in the development of the rural 
regions as they implement various 
centrally sponsored schemes. 
The Bank has on-boarded 4,500 
plus Gram Panchayats for smooth 
implementation of the Rashtriya Gram 
Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) Scheme and 
collection of taxes through QR and 
PoS solutions.

Disbursement of  
Government Funds
HDFC Bank continues to be one of 
the leading banks to mobilise funds 
under the public welfare schemes. It 
has helped disburse over H 1 lakh crore 
by processing 8.81 crore transactions. 
This represents approximately 39 
per cent growth as compared to the 
previous fiscal.
The Bank also handled approximately 
30 per cent of the total funds flowing 
from the Central Government to 
various beneficiaries under the aegis 
of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, 
Central Sector Schemes and the 15th 
Finance Commission.
HDFC Bank continues to be 
committed to supporting the evolving 
financial needs of the Government. 
It continues to invest in necessary 
capacity building and technology 
advancements to achieve this.
The Bank has also enhanced its own 
systems to ensure compliance with 
public expenditure guidelines.
The FARSight Dashboard launched 
last year has been extended to a wider 
base of Government departments. 
The dashboard helps monitor the 
flow and utilisation of funds at various 
levels of the administration.
Partnering with 
Institutions
The Bank aids education and 
religious institutions by advancing 
their digitalisation efforts, facilitating 
smooth fee and donation collection 
processes along with their day-to-day 
activities. It is working with more than 
10,000 institutions to help digitalise 
their collections and payouts, thereby 
improving their overall efficiency.
The Bank continues to expand 
its presence in the key sectors of 
education and religious institutions. 
Relationships were established with 
eminent educational institutions 
like IIMs, NITs, BITS Pilani amongst 
others. Some prominent religious 
institutions on-boarded this past year 
include Shrinathji Temple - Nathdwara, 
Shri Badrinath Kedarnath Mandir 
Samiti, Catholic Mission of Western 
Bengal, Ramakrishna Mission, Sree 
Ayyappan Temple Trust and a chain of 
ISKCON temples.
Collect Now
The Bank’s Collect Now platform has 
gained momentum in the last year. 
This platform helps the Government 
manage its collections more 
efficiently. It brings 15+ online and 
offline payment modes together with 
realtime validations. This has not only 
provided ease of reconciliation but 
also provided them with a seamless 
onboarding experience. Importantly, it 
provides unique benefits such as:
• Single settlement cycle for cards, 
UPI and other online modes
• Unified payout reports across 
collection modes
• A self–service dashboard for 
institutions to track their daily 
collections across various collection 
modes, generate refunds, send 
payment links to customers and 
generate QR codes amongst others

Nodal Officers for the continuous 
enhancement of its services to 
pensioners. It also participates 
regularly in Pension Adalats to 
understand the needs of this segment.
Further, the Bank has enhanced its 
internal systems for faster onboarding 
of pensioners through digital channels.
HDFC Bank has also extended 
its branch network for Defence 
pensioners to avail various pension 
services. This has been made possible 
by integrating with the SPARSH portal, 
a system implemented by the Principal 
Controller of Defence Accounts 
(Pension).
Further, for the convenience of senior 
citizens, the Bank has extended 
its Doorstep Banking services. 
Integration with Jeevan Praman portal 
of the Government of India has helped 
in submission of digital life certificate 
avoiding the need for a visit to a 
branch for this purpose.

Railway Establishments
HDFC Bank extends financial services 
to the service providers of the defence 
and railways sectors. This includes 
project financing, working capital 
loans and trade finance. It

the efficiency and effectiveness of 
these sectors.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 30th Annual 
Report on the business and financial operations of your Bank, 
together with the audited accounts for the year ended March 
31, 2024.
The Financial Year 2023-24 was a historic one as the merger 
of parent HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank was 
completed. This merger strengthened our position as a 
leading financial conglomerate with marquee financial services 
institutions like HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited, HDFC 
Asset Management Company Limited and HDFC ERGO 
General Insurance Company Limited becoming subsidiaries 
in addition to the existing ones, HDFC Securities Limited and 
HDB Financial Services Limited. 
Coming to the macroeconomic environment, India is expected 
to be one of the fastest growing major economies in the world 
in the Financial Year 2024-25 with the RBI expecting GDP 
growth at 7.2 per cent. 
Over the past three years, the Indian economy grew on an 
average by 8.3 per cent and at 8.2 per cent in FY24. GDP growth 
has been supported by an increase in capital expenditure with 
the Government doing the heavy lifting. Inflationary pressures 
have moderated over the last fiscal year with retail inflation 
averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23.
On the global front, geopolitical tensions could act as a 
headwind for India’s growth and inflation outlook. However, 
while these challenges may pose some risks the resilience 
and momentum shown by the domestic economy in recent 
years suggests that it is well-equipped to navigate any 
potential headwinds.
For more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic 
and Industry section on page no. 220.
Your Bank continued to grow in this environment by conducting 
its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the 
environment and community at large.
Financial Parameters
The Bank’s key financial parameters continued to be 
healthy, primarily attributable to its robust credit evaluation of 
targeted customers and a well-diversified loan book across 
sectors, customer segments and products. Its performance 
is an outcome of its disciplined approach to managing risk 
and return.
The figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the 
operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited which amalgamated 
with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the 
comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at 
in light of the same.
Based on Standalone Financial Statements
The income statement reflected a growth in revenue comprising 
Net Interest Income and Non Interest Income. While the former 
grew by 25.0 per cent, the latter grew by 57.7 per cent year-
on-year. On an overall basis, Total Net Revenue for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, reached ` 1,57,773.5 crore, reflecting 
an increase of 33.6 per cent over the previous year.

In a Snapshot
(Standalone)
Stepping into a new Era
The merger strengthens our position as a leading financial 
conglomerate with an unwavering commitment to enhancing 
customer service. The fusion of erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
strong  position in the mortgage business and HDFC Bank’s 
operational efficiencies  and wider reach, brings significant 
benefits for customers, employees and shareholders, 
amplifying scale and product offerings. 
The Integration Committee, formed in October 2022, played a 
vital role in overseeing the seamless post-merger integration 
of HDFC Bank and erstwhile HDFC Limited. Strategically 
planning and coordinating 32 key workstreams, the committee  
ensured effective implementation and synergy, prioritising 
the minimisation of customer grievances and regulatory 
compliance. Looking ahead, the Bank’s focus remains on 
profitable growth. By leveraging HDFC Limited’s extensive 
home loan customer base, the Bank will strategically implement 
cross selling initiatives, offering need-based products through 
digital journeys without incurring additional acquisition costs. 
We aim to transform our branches into experiential hubs, 
integrating digital innovation with personalised service to 
elevate customer engagement.

Summary
The Indian economy registered an average growth rate of 8.3 
per cent over the last three years, with growth standing at  
8.2 per cent in the Financial Year 2023-24. Going forward, 
India is expected to remain one of the fastest growing major 
economies in the world in FY25, with the RBI projecting GDP 
growth at 7.2 per cent.  
This is expected to be aided by some recovery in consumer 
spending particularly in rural areas. The other positive 
factors that support demand are a normal monsoon, stable 
inflation and expected reduction in interest rates. Your Bank 
is well-positioned to make the most of these opportunities 
by leveraging the strength of its balance sheet and the trust 
enjoyed by its brand. 
It is also committed to supporting nation building particularly 
furthering rural prosperity through both its business and social 
initiatives. We will continue to be a responsible corporate citizen 
contributing to the development of society and promoting 
sustainability. This journey will of course not be possible 
without the continuing support of our ever-growing family of 
over 2.13 lakh employees. 
We are committed to hiring and retaining the best talent and 
being among the industry’s leading employers.
Mission and Strategic Focus
Your Bank’s mission is to be a ‘World-Class Indian Bank’. Its 
business philosophy is based on five core values: Customer 
Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People 
and Sustainability. Sustainability should be viewed in unison 
with Environmental, Social and Governance performance. As 
a part of this your Bank, through its CSR initiative Parivartan, 
seeks to bring about change in the lives of communities mainly 
in rural India.
During the year under review, HDFC Bank did not lose the 
human touch and continued building a sound customer 
franchise across distinct businesses to achieve healthy growth 
in profitability consistent with its  risk appetite.
In line with the above objective, the Bank aims to take 
digitalisation to the next level. The objective is to:
• De
liver superior experience and greater convenience
to customers
• In
crease market share in India’s growing banking and
financial services industry

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Management Discussion and Analysis 
Macroeconomic and Industry Development 
Over the past three years, the Indian economy registered an 
average growth rate of 8.3 per cent. India’s real GDP growth 
has been pegged at 8.2 per cent for FY24 as per the provisional 
estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 
The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital 
expenditure particularly in infrastructure development including 
roads, highways, railways and housing with the Government 
doing the heavy lifting. Additionally, private sector investment 
also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as 
cement, steel, oil and gas. 
On the other hand, private consumption growth slowed to 
4.0 per cent in FY24 from 6.8 per cent in FY23 and 11.7 per 
cent in FY22. To recall, post the pandemic, consumption had 
been driven by services along with high demand for premium 
products. However, as this pent-up demand effect waned and 
interest rates started rising consumer demand slowed down in 
FY24. Moreover, high food inflation and an uneven monsoon 
weighed on rural demand recovery. 
As for the supply side, rise in manufacturing and construction 
activity has largely aided growth. The manufacturing sector 
has benefitted from improved profit margins due to lower 
input costs, while Government support schemes such as 
the ECLGS aided MSMEs. Further, favourable infrastructure 
and policy measures like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 
and FAME 2 Schemes finally paid off for some critical sectors 
like automobiles, electronics (largely mobile handsets) and 
metals. Moreover, the construction sector has maintained an 
average growth rate of 13.1 per cent over the past three years 
supported by Government infrastructure investments and an 
increased housing market demand. 
On the external front, slowdown in global growth significantly 
impacted India’s exports of goods and services in FY24. 
However, expansion of professional and business services 
exports combined with diversification to new markets such as 
Central Asia and Latin America helped cushion the impact of 
the slowdown elsewhere in the global economy.
Going forward, India is expected to remain one of the fastest 
growing economies in the World in FY25 with the RBI forecasting 
a GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent. Economic activity is expected 
to be supported by a further surge in private capital expenditure 
and continued Government capital spending. Moreover, a 
higher allocation for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) sectors 
in the Budget for FY25 is likely to bolster manufacturing activity 
and attract FDI flows. In addition, a continued diversification 
of supply chains out of China and to other emerging markets 
is likely to channel investment flows into India. Furthermore, 
the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth 
forecast by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent for FY24 which bodes well 
for India’s economic growth. In addition, domestic consumer 
spending is expected to see some recovery particularly in rural 
areas as a normal monsoon, stable inflation and a reduction in 
interest rates support demand.
Inflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year, 
with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per 
cent in FY23. Although, retail headline inflation rose to a high 
of 7.4 per cent in July 2023 it has since moderated reaching 
4.83 per cent in April 2024. Encouragingly, core inflation (retail 
inflation excluding food and fuel) has also dipped below 4 per 
cent signalling a disinflationary trend. Going forward, we expect 
retail inflation to average at 4.6 per cent in FY25 assuming 
normal monsoon. Additionally, a favourable economic base 
and controlled core inflation is expected to offer support.  That 
said, weather related disturbances such as heatwaves, uneven 
distribution of monsoons along with a resurgence in global 
commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation trajectory.
Emerging risks on the global front could pose challenges to 
India’s growth trajectory and inflation outlook. Higher crude 
oil prices as a result of any escalation in Middle East tensions 
and tighter global oil supply pose a risk for domestic growth 
and inflation. Moreover, the impact of geopolitical tensions on 
global supply chains could hurt India’s exports to major trading 
partners and escalate costs. However, while global challenges 
may pose some risks, the resilience and momentum shown 
by the domestic economy in recent years suggests it is well-
equipped to navigate any potential headwinds.

customer connect with HDFC Bank’s extensive branch 
network, ability to leverage technology platforms and a wide 
bouquet of banking products. The Gross Retail Mortgage

which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023

the Home Loan Business in conjunction with HDFC Limited. As 
per this arrangement, your Bank sourced HDFC home loans 
while HDFC Limited approved and disbursed them. HDFC 
Bank received a sourcing fee for these loans and as per the 
arrangement had the option to purchase loans for a value up 
to 70 per cent of the loans sourced by the Bank either through 
the issuance of mortgage-backed Pass-Through Certificates 
(PTCs) or a direct assignment of loans. The balance was 
retained by HDFC Limited. 
The Bank is gradually converting erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
service centres to branches and has a well-defined approach 
for this. Cross-selling remains a primary focus for both existing 
and new customers, leveraging the Bank’s digital channels 
to minimise acquisition costs effectively. Post the merger, 
approximately 85 per cent of the newly acquired home loan 
customers hold a liability account with your bank. Your Bank’s 
market share growth on incremental disbursals is in double 
digits post - merger.

engine for your Bank in the year under review. This business 
focuses on institutional customers such as the Government, 
PSUs, Large and Emerging Corporates and SMEs. Your Bank 
offers a range of products and services encompassing working 
capital and term loans, trade credit, cash management, 
supply chain financing, foreign exchange and investment 
banking services. 
The Wholesale Banking business recorded healthy growth, 
ending Financial Year 2023-24 with a domestic loan book size 
of ` 10,87,084 crore, recording a growth of 32 per cent over 
the earlier year. This constituted about 44 per cent of your

was able to expand its share of the customer wallet primarily 
using sharper customization, cross-selling and expanding into 
more geographies.
Based on its superior product delivery, service levels and strong 
customer orientation, the Bank has made significant inroads 
into the banking consortia of a number of leading corporates. 
Corporate Banking, focusing on large, well-rated companies 
continued to be the biggest contributor to Wholesale Banking 
in terms of asset size.
This business continued its attention towards engaging with 
Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) and capitalised on the 
increasing trend among large companies to consolidate their 
banking relationships. Your Bank strengthened its existing 
relationships and expanded its market share by leveraging its 
extensive array of product offerings. This business provided 
support to customer requirements under the Production Linked 
Incentive (PLI) Scheme. The Emerging Corporates Group which 
focuses on the mid- market segment too witnessed significant 
growth. Your Bank leveraged its vast geographical reach, 
technology backbone, automated processes, suite of financial 
products and quick turnaround times to offer a differentiated 
service. The business continues to have a diversified portfolio 
in terms of both industry and geography. 
In the year under review, the Bank continued its focus 
on the MSME sector. There has already been increased 
formalistion and digitalisation of the MSME sector owing to the 
implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). Through 
MyBusiness, which offers comprehensive financial solutions 
like Business Banking, Easy Loans, Trade Services and Digital 
Solutions, MSMEs can conveniently access a suite of product 
/ services tailored to meet the business requirements.
Post the merger of HDFC Limited with HDFC Bank, the Bank

March 31, 2024.
The Investment Banking business further cemented its 
prominent position in the Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital

disbursements streamlining end-to-end SCF transactions for 
the corporates. Your Bank has also integrated with all the three 
TReDS platforms. We are also collaborating with Fintechs to

Treasury
The Treasury Department is the custodian of your Bank’s cash/
liquid assets and handles its investments in securities, foreign 
exchange and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity and 
interest rate risks on the balance sheet and is also responsible 
for meeting reserve requirements. The vertical also helps 
manage the hedging needs of customers and earns a fee 
income generated from transactions customers undertake 
with your Bank while managing their foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions 
based on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated 
hedging needs. Your Bank recorded a revenue of ` 4,001.10 
crore from foreign exchange and derivative transactions in the 
year under review. 
As a part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into 
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties after 
it has set up appropriate credit limits based on its evaluation 
of the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. Where 
your Bank enters into foreign currency derivatives contracts not 
involving the Indian Rupee with its customers, it typically lays 
them off in the inter-bank market on a matched basis. For such 
foreign currency derivatives, your Bank primarily carries the 
counterparty credit risk (where the customer has crystallised 
payables or ‘mark-to-market’ losses) and may carry only 
residual market risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives 
on its own account including for the purpose of its own balance 
sheet risk management.
HDFC Bank is also a nominated agent for the bullion imports 
and has a significant market share in that business.
Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government securities in 
line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR). A significant portion of these SLR securities are in 
‘Held-to- Maturity’ (HTM) category, while some are ‘Available for 
Sale’ (AFS). The Bank is also a primary dealer for Government 
Securities. As a part of this business, your Bank holds fixed 
income securities as ‘Held for Trading’ (HFT). 
In the year under review, your Bank continued to be a significant 
participant in the domestic exchange and interest rate markets. 
It also capitalised on falling bond yields to book profits and 
is now looking at tapping opportunities arising out of the 
liberalisation in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
B. I nternational Business
During the year, your Bank stayed on course to cater to NRI 
clients and deepen its product and service proposition. Your 
Bank has global footprints by way of representative offices and 
branches in countries like Bahrain, Hong Kong, the UAE and 
Kenya. It also has a presence in International Financial Service 
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. In addition, 
two existing representative offices of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
in London and Singapore have become representative offices 
of the Bank as per the composite scheme of amalgamation 
between HDFC Bank Limited and HDFC Limited. These offices 
are for providing loans-related services for availing housing 
loans in India and for the purchase of properties in India.
The Bank’s product strategy in International Markets is 
customer centric and it has products to cater to client needs 
across asset classes. GIFT City branch offers products such 
as trade credits, foreign currency term loans (including external 
commercial borrowings). It has gradually widening the product 
offerings to cater to the needs of Resident and Non-Resident 
clients and capitalise on the growth in the financial centre.

Business was US $ 9.06 billion. Advances constituted 1.55% 
of the Bank’s advances. The Total Income contributed by 
Overseas Branches constituted 1.51% of the Bank’s Total 
Income for the year.

D. S emi-Urban and Rural
The Semi-Urban and Rural (SURU) markets have always been 
a focus of your Bank’s strategy. In the last few years, your Bank 
has made a renewed push into these markets as rising income 
levels and aspirations of rural customers are leading to demand 
for better quality financial products and services. The Bank has 
been increasing its presence in Semi-Urban and Rural markets 
to cater to these demands. 
Apart from meeting its statutory obligations under PSL (Agri 
and Allied activities, Small and Marginal Farmers and Weaker 
Sections), your Bank has been offering a wide range of products 
on the asset side, such as Auto, Two-Wheeler, Personal, Gold, 
Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) and Small Shopkeeper Loans 
in these markets. Having expanded the rural footprint to more 
than 2.25 lakh villages, HDFC Bank now plans to increase its 
coverage in existing villages and deepen the relationships. The 
Semi-Urban and Rural push has been backed by the Bank’s 
digital strategy. Your Bank’s operations in Semi-Urban and 
Rural locations are explained below:

targets set by the Government in recent campaigns.
HDFC Bank is increasingly involved in facilitating various 
Government/Regulatory Schemes to other Non-crop 
Segments, including Agri-allied and Small Agri-Business 
Enterprises, as well as Rural MSMEs. A unique business model 
encompassing a wide variety of products and services driven 
by a relationship management approach ensures suitable 
solutions as well as financial literacy to farmers. The Bank has 
tailored a range of crop and geography-specific products to 
align with harvest cycles and address the specific needs of 
farmers across diverse Agro-climatic zones. This customer-
centric approach has transformed the rural banking services, 
enabling the delivery of personalised offerings to meet the 
evolving needs of rural customers effectively.

Products such as post-harvest cash credit and warehouse 
receipt financing facilitate faster cash flows to farmers, while

Bank’s Commercial and Rural Banking Group (CRB) plays a 
pivotal role in product development, planning, and monitoring 
strategies for growth. The Bank’s targeted branch expansion in 
SURU regions coupled with digital interventions aims to create 
a superior customer experience and position HDFC Bank as a 
future-ready institution.

this scheme, the Bank is offering medium to long-term debt

Business with a digital optimisation strategy, your Bank 
plans to onboard AgriTech-BCs with differentiated business 
models. These BCs will help source and service small and 
marginal farmers.
Funding Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs):
Your Bank views lending to the agriculture sector, including 
to small and marginal farmers, as a huge opportunity and 
not just a regulatory mandate to meet priority sector lending 
requirements. The Bank has leveraged its extensive knowledge 
of rural customers to create as well as deliver products and 
services at affordable price points and with a quick turnaround 
time. This has enabled HDFC Bank to establish a strong 
footprint in the rural geographies which it has now leveraged

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
HDFC Bank has financed and supported 35 lakh Small and 
Marginal Farmers. This was achieved through a strategy 
to engage closely with small and marginal farmers through 
customised agriculture loans. Leveraging the Government 
schemes, it has launched various secured / unsecured loan 
products including Loan Against Gold as security targeting 
small and marginal farmers in Agri and Allied segments.
Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs):
For agriculture productivity and incomes to grow, aggregation 
of farm holdings in the form of FPOs is the key strategy in 
doubling farmers’ income. Leveraging the Government 
scheme for formation and promotion of 10,000 new FPOs 
(Credit guarantee is available from NABARD/CGTMSE), your 
Bank has funded eligible FPOs for working capital and term 
loan requirements. As of March 31, 2024, your Bank was 
able to reach 206 FPOs covering  about one lakh small and 
marginal farmers.
Dairy:
Dairy is the largest segment in the agriculture economy, and 
keeping this in mind, your Bank has created a separate team 
of agriculture specialists to cater to this segment. India, boasts 
of a substantial cattle population of over 30 crore, that offers 
a promising landscape for Cattle Finance as well as securing 
liabilities. The country’s agriculture sector, particularly the 
Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) segment, stands to benefit 
significantly in this scenario, with over 90 per cent of them 
falling within this category. Recognizing the potential for growth 
and financial inclusion, your Bank has initiated a strategic 
programme named ’Dairy Ki Pheri’. This initiative is designed 
to empower milkmen by facilitating their evolution from mere 
milk vendors to dairy entrepreneurs - transforming them from 
Doodh Walas to Doodh Lalas.
During the reporting period, HDFC Bank disbursed a total 
equivalent to `  1,531 crore to 43,243 cases. Additionally, 
19,000 cases were under active processing. This surge in 
disbursement is noteworthy as it marks a significant increase 
from the average of 1,500 cases per month over the past 8 
months, nearly tripling the previous rate. The disbursement 
primarily focused on small and marginal farmer loans.
In Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has disbursed an amount 
of ` 8,786 crore to 2,47,533 farmers as Cattle finance.
Digital Interventions
Some of the digital interventions made by your bank include:
Digitising Milk Procurement:
This initiative brings transparency in the milk procurement 
and payment process, which benefits both farmers and dairy 
societies. Multi-function Terminals (MFTs), popularly known 
as Milk-to-Money ATMs, are deployed in dairy societies. The 
MFTs link the milk procurement system of the dairy society to 
the farmer’s account to enable faster payments. MFTs have 
cash dispensers that function as standard ATMs. Payments 
are credited without the hassles of cash distribution. Further, 
this process creates a credit history which can then be used 
for accessing bank credit. Apart from dairy and cattle loans, 
customers gain access to the Bank’s products including digital 
offerings such as 10 Second Personal Loan, Kisan Credit Card 
and Bill Pay. So far, the Bank has digitised payments at over 
357 milk cooperatives across two states, benefitting more than 
2.6 lakh dairy farmers. The Dairy business witnessed 142 per 
cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 121 per cent 
in the book.
Gold Loans:
Your Bank is making inroads into a market dominated by the 
unorganized sector, moneylenders and pawn brokers. The 
Bank is keen on making the gold loan facility available across 
the length and breadth of the country. As on March 31, 2024, 
the Bank is offering gold loans through 4,604 branches, with 45 
per cent of these branches in Semi-Urban and Rural locations. 
Your Bank is implementing its blueprint of making gold loans 
available in most of its branches and thereby taking this product 
within the reach of otherwise untapped customer segments.
Social Initiatives in Farm Sector
The farm sector faces threats arising out of climate change as 
evident from the growing number of extreme weather events. 
In addition, factors like soil health, input quality (seeds and 
fertilizers), water availability, and Government policy have 
significant impact, along with price realisations and storage 
facilities. All this has an impact on farm yield and income.
Given the vulnerabilities, it is critical to strengthen climate 
resilience and adaptability of the agri-food sector. In this 
context, your Bank has launched a variety of initiatives such as 
Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP), Crop Residue 
HDFC Bank Limited
230
Management Project and many others. Within regulatory 
guidelines, your Bank has also been providing relief to the 
impacted farmers. It also has put in place systems designed 
to enable Direct Benefit Transfers in a time-bound manner.
Lending to the agriculture sector, including to small and 
marginal farmers, is a regulatory mandate as part of priority 
sector lending requirements. The Bank has leveraged its 
extensive knowledge of rural customers to create as well as 
deliver products and services at affordable price points and 
with a quick turnaround time. This has enabled the Bank to 
establish a strong footprint in the rural geographies, which 
it has now leveraged to increase its penetration of liability 
products. Further, your Bank has been working with a segment-
specific approach like funding to horticulture clusters, supply 
chain finance, agri business, MSMEs and dairy farmers. It also 
continues to engage closely with farmers to mitigate risks and 
protect portfolio quality.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector serves as an important engine for economic 
growth and is one of the largest employers in the economy.  
As on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s assets in the MSME 
segment stood at ` 5,03,598.23 crore. The Micro Enterprises 
assets alone stood at ` 1,69,448 crore. 
The Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
have been providing support for lending to MSME segment on 
an ongoing basis. They had provided special support to the 
MSME sector during the pandemic through various schemes, 
such as Interest Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS extension and 
COVID support loans. The Government has also launched a 
revamped CGTMSE scheme with increased limit threshold 
for guarantee cover and reduction of guarantee fee. Many 
other schemes like Credit Guarantee to Start Ups (CGSS) and 
Extension of interest subvention have been rolled out. 
Your bank emerged as the largest contributor to CGTMSE in 
FY24, supporting the MSME sector with guarantee-covered 
credit facilities. This has further supported the growth of MSME 
loans which have shown a year-on-year growth of 21.4 per cent. 
The pace of digitalisation among MSMEs has accelerated, 
which has helped to speed up the pace of disbursement 
and increase transparency in the sector. Customers can now 
apply online and submit required documents digitally and 
they can also execute post-sanction agreements digitally to 
avail of facilities quickly with straight-through disbursement.  
The Government’s digitalisation push, the adoption of GST 
and reforms in return filings, such as income tax, have made 
it easier to access customer cash flow and financial data, 
which can be used to support decision making and portfolio 
monitoring. Your Bank’s SME portal continues to offer ad hoc 
approvals and pre-approved Temporary Overdrafts (TODs) on a 
Straight Through Processing (STP) basis to existing customers. 
They can request a top-up of loans and submit the required 
documents online. The SME portal also allows customers 
to access your Bank’s services related to sanctioned credit 
facilities 24/7 from anywhere. Customers can download various 
certificates and statements as needed on an ongoing basis.
On the trade side, your Bank focuses on customer engagement 
to increase the penetration of Trade on Net applications. Trade 
on Net is a complete enterprise trade solution for customers 
engaged in domestic and foreign trade. It enables them to 
initiate and track requests online seamlessly, reducing time 
and costs.
Taking Banking to the Unbanked
As a responsible banker, one of our commitments is extending 
banking solutions to the most remote and farthest regions of the 
country empowering under-banked communities with access 
to formal financial channels. Our widespread physical network 
and a comprehensive suite of digital banking solutions ensure 
broad coverage across India. 52 per cent of our branches are 
situated in semi-urban and rural areas. Our banking solutions 
offer convenient last-mile access through mobile applications 
like BHIM, UPI, USSD, Scan and Pay, as well as Aadhaar and 
RuPay-enabled Micro-ATMs.

Technology related challenges over the past few years have 
only made the Bank’s resolve stronger to consolidate and 
fortify its technology environment. Focused technology / digital 
investments and programs in technology are pivotal to the 
Bank in the new age of digital banking and experiences for 
its customers.
Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal
Customer Focus is one of the five core values of the Bank. Given 
a highly competitive business environment, especially with 
diverse lines of businesses, we continuously strive to enhance 
customer experience. Delivering exceptional product quality 
and customer service delivery is a prerequisite for sustained 
growth. The Bank strives to achieve this by seeking customer 
feedback, benchmarking with best-in-class business entities 
and implementing customer-centric improvements. We have 
adopted a three-step strategy regarding Customer Service - 
Define, Measure and Improve.
HDFC Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to provide 
an omnichannel experience to its customers. On the one 
hand, it has traditional touchpoints like Branches, Email Care 
and PhoneBanking. On the other hand, it has state-of-the-
art platforms like NetBanking, MobileBanking, WhatsaApp 
Banking, the chatbot Eva and the bank’s exclusive social care 
handles. The Bank also has a Virtual Relationship Manager 
(VRM) programme to cater to various financial needs in a 
personalised manner. 
Customer service performance and grievance redressal are 
regularly assessed at various levels, including Branch Level 
Customer Service Committees, Standing Committee on 
Customer Service and Customer Service Committee of the 
Board. HDFC Bank has implemented robust processes to 
monitor and measure service quality levels across touchpoints, 
including at product and process level, through the efforts of 
the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts regular reviews across 
various products, processes and channels, focusing on 
improving the customer experience. A unique Service Quality 
Index (SQI) has been developed to measure the performance 
of key customer facing channels based on critical customer 
service parameters. This SQI enables continuous improvement 
of initiatives to raise service standards. 
One of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable 
level of customer service is to have an effective Internal 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism / Framework. HDFC Bank 
has developed a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy, 
Customer Rights Policy, Customer Compensation Policy, 
duly approved by the Board, which outline a framework for 
resolving customer grievances. These policies are accessible 
to customers through the Bank’s website and branch network.
HDFC Bank has created multiple channels for customers 
to provide feedback and register grievances, facilitating a 
transparent and accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative 
financial solutions and digital platforms, it has witnessed an 
increased utilisation of its digital channels. Keeping customer 
interest in focus, the Bank has formulated a Board approved 
Protection Policy which limits the liability of customers in case 
of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. 
This Bank is compliant with the RBI Internal Ombudsman 
Guidelines. At the apex level, as a part of the Internal Grievance 
Redressal mechanism, the Bank has appointed seasoned-
retired bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to independently 
review any customer grievance which is partly/wholly rejected 
by the Bank before the final decision is communicated to 
the customer.
HDFC Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty 
through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback 
system. This customer experience transformation programme 
helps employees to empathise better with customers and 
improve turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’, the 
programme helps establish behaviours and practices that result 
in customer-centric actions through continuous improvement 
in products, services, processes and policies.

The Bank remains committed to placing the customer at the 
centre of its operations. By consistently improving customer 
experience, adopting an omnichannel approach and 
implementing robust service quality and grievance redressal 
mechanisms, it aims to build lasting relationships.
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality
Your Bank’s historical focus on Pillar 1 risks including Credit 
Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk has been expanded 
in response to the evolving banking landscape. Liquidity Risk, 
Climate Risk, Information Technology Risk and Information 
Security Risk have also emerged as critical considerations. 
These risks not only impact your Bank’s financial strength and 
operations but also its reputation. To address these concerns, 
your Bank has established Board-approved risk strategy and 
policies overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee 
(RPMC). The Committee ensures that frameworks are 
established for assessing and managing various risks faced by 
your Bank, systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s 
capital level and methods are in place for monitoring compliance 
with internal risk management policies and processes. The 
Committee guides the development of policies, procedures 
and systems for managing risks. It ensures that these are 
adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, 
the structure and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite. 
The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it 
is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence 
only at the CEO level.

Credit Risk
Credit Risk is the possibility of losses associated with diminution 
in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. Losses 
stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value. Your 
Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, 
procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail 
and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on 
an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, given the 
granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed 
largely on a portfolio basis across various products and 
customer segments. Robust front-end and back-end systems 
are in place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses. 
The factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include 
income, demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking 
behaviour. In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed 
and used to assess different segments of customers based on 
portfolio behavior. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by 
capping exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit 
rating grades and country among others. This is backed by 
portfolio diversification, stringent credit approval processes, 
periodic post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. 
Your Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile 
times in the lending environment by stringently adhering to 
prudent norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank also 
has a robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, 
which are reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures 
are within approved appetite.
As on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non-
Performing Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.24 per 
cent. Net Non-Performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing 
Assets Less Specific Loan Loss provisions) was 0.33 per cent 
of Net Advances.
Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific 
provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than 
the minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the 
regulatory norms for Standard Assets.

Financial Statements
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Digital and Credit Risk
Driven by rapid technological advancements, the banking 
sector is witnessing the increasing importance of digitalisation 
as a critical differentiator for customer retention and service 
delivery. Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and 
quick method for customers to secure loans with just a few 
clicks often in minutes, if not seconds. However, addressing 
the risks associated with digital lending is crucial and your 
Bank has implemented appropriate measures to manage these 
risks effectively. Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your 
Bank’s existing customers. Often, they are customers across 
multiple products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their 
credit history and risk profile. This accessibility facilitates the 
evaluation of their loan eligibility. Moreover, the credit checks 
and scores used by your Bank in process-based underwriting 
are replicated for digital loans. This ensures consistency in the 
evaluation process. 
Market Risk
Market Risk arises primarily from your Bank’s statutory reserve 
management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and 
currency market. These risks are managed through a well-
defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, 
Foreign Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that 
caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through 
trading risk limits / triggers. The risk measures include position 
limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, 
Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option 
Greeks, Value-at-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level 
(SLTL), Scenario-based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger 
Level (PLTL) and are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In 
addition, forex open positions, currency option delta, and 
interest rate sensitivity limits are computed and monitored on 
an intraday basis. This is supplemented by a Board-approved 
stress testing policy and framework that simulates various 
market risk scenarios to measure losses and initiate remedial 
measures. Your Bank’s Market Risk capital charge is computed 
daily using the Standardised Measurement Method applying 
the regulatory factors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring 
unacceptable losses. Your Bank’s liquidity and interest rate 
risk management framework is spelt out through a well-
defined Board approved Asset Liability Management Policy. 
As part of this process, your Bank has established various 
Board-approved limits for liquidity and interest rate risks in 
the banking book. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a 
decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity 
and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line 
with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence 
to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. ALCO reviews 
the policy’s implementation and monitoring of limits. While the 
maturity gap, Basel III ratios and stock ratio limits help manage 
liquidity risk, Net Interest Income impact and market value 
of equity (MVE) impact help mitigate interest rate risk in the 
banking book. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board-
approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and 
interest rate risk.
Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural 
pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded 
options available to customers, which are used while managing 
maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank has the 
necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel 
Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking 
sector. The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure 
your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to ensure that the 
Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily 
and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day 
calendar liquidity stress scenario. The LCR helps in improving 
the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from 
financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the 
real economy. Based on Basel III norms, your Bank’s average 
LCR stood at 117.35 per cent on a consolidated basis for 
financial year 2023-24 as against the regulatory threshold at 
100 per cent.
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk 
measure under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to 
measure your Bank’s liquidity position. The NSFR seeks to 
ensure that your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in 
relation to the composition of its assets and off-balance sheet 
activities. The NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term 
time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with 
Average Liquidity Coverage Ratio

On a Consolidated Basis for the 
Financial Year 2023-24

more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The RBI 
guidelines stipulated a minimum NSFR requirement of 100 per 
cent at a consolidated level and your Bank has maintained the 
NSFR well above 100 per cent since its implementation. Based 
on guidelines issued by RBI, your Bank’s NSFR stood at 120.81 
per cent on a consolidated basis March 31, 2024.
Operational Risk
This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. It also 
includes risk of loss due to legal risk but excludes strategic and 
reputational risk.

heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information

legal requirements and operational processes and provides 
timely feedback to the management for corrective actions. A 
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site 
monitoring by use of data analytics and automation tools to 
study trends/patterns to detect outliers (if any) and alert the 
management for due corrective action, wherever warranted.

necessary also proactively recommend improvements in 
operational processes and service quality for such new 
products / processes.

has a reporting line to the Audit Committee of the Board 
and a dotted line reporting to the Managing Director for 
administrative purposes. 
The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews and 
ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes 
a compliance culture in the Bank.
Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC), 
Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of 
Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines / provisions 
of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating 
the key elements of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer 
Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of 
Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and

Your Directors would also like to take this opportunity to 
express their appreciation for the hard work and dedicated 
efforts put in by the Bank’s employees and look forward to 
their continued contribution. 
Conclusion
The year under review witnessed the amalgamation of erstwhile 
HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank. This has opened up 
immense opportunities through the fusion of e-HDFC Limited’s 
home loan expertise with HDFC Bank’s operational efficiencies 
and wider reach. The amalgamation also offers huge prospects 
for cross sell. All in all, it is going to be a key driver for future 
growth. The under penetration of banking services in India is 
an opportunity by itself. HDFC Bank is well placed to capitalise 
on this given its inherent balance sheet and brand strengths. 
While chasing growth, the Bank will not lose sight of adhering 
to corporate governance standards, serving customers in a 
transparent way and treating employees fairly.

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA): 
Total NPA as at March 31, 2024: 31,056.65 Crores 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2024: 22,966.09 Crores
(Refer Schedule 17 (C)(3), Schedule 18 note 9)
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated April 
01, 2023 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for 
such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The 
identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors 
like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated 
based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, 
nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification 
of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing 
Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, 
application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its 
significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
Ø
  Understood 
the process and controls, and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
•  
 Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things
includes 
the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and 
drawing power;
•  
 Identification and classification of Non-performing
Advances 
in accordance with IRAC norms, other 
regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration 
of qualitative aspects; and
•  
 T
esting of application controls including testing of
automated controls and  reports.       
Ø
  Evaluated 
the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that the 
basis of provisioning is in accordance with the Board of Directors 
approved policy and IRAC norms.
Ø
  W
ith respect to classification of Non-performing Advances,
verified the date of Non-performing Advances and recomputed 
the Days Past Due on a sample basis. 
Ø
  On a test check basis, verified the classification of accounts
r
eported by the Bank as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) 
in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits 
(‘CRILC’).
Ø
  W
ith respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing
Advances, provision calculations on a sample basis taking 
into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the 
IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our 
outcome to that prepared by the management and tested 
relevant assumptions and judgements which were used by the 
management.

Appropriateness of accounting for amalgamation of erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (“erstwhile HDFC Limited”) 
with the Bank , the related adjustments [including adjustments to and integration of Information Technology (IT) systems] and communications 
with RBI relating to the amalgamation
(Refer Schedule 18 note 1)
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The composite scheme for the amalgamation of (i) erstwhile HDFC 
Investments Limited and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited into and 
with erstwhile HDFC Limited and (ii) erstwhile HDFC Limited into 
and with the Bank, (the “Scheme”) has been given effect to in the 
Standalone Financial statements with effect from July 1, 2023 (i.e., the 
appointed and effective date for the Scheme), in accordance with the 
‘pooling of interests’ method as prescribed in AS-14 “Accounting for 
Amalgamations”.
The amalgamation entailed transfer of various IT systems of the 
erstwhile HDFC Limited to the Bank, including integration of some 
systems with the financial reporting system and other related 
applications of the Bank; and transfer of underlying financial data of 
the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s business.
Further, the Bank had sought certain forbearances from the RBI. The 
RBI has granted certain forbearances and provided clarifications to 
the Bank through various communications.
Considering the magnitude of the amounts involved, complexity of the 
transaction and the related adjustments (including those related to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) impacting Standalone Financial 
Statements, and in view of its significance to the overall Standalone 
Financial Statements, we have determined the accounting for the 
amalgamation and the related adjustments (including those to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) and communications with RBI 
relating to the amalgamation, to be a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
Ø
  Understood the pr
ocess and controls, and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of key controls, including 
Information Technology general and application controls relating 
to accounting for amalgamations, and integration of IT Systems 
(impacting financial reporting) of erstwhile HDFC Limited; 
Ø
  
Perused the NCLT approved Scheme of Amalgamation for the
appropriateness of determination of the effective date of the 
scheme and the accounting treatment as prescribed in the 
Scheme;
Ø
  T
raced the assets and liabilities of erstwhile HDFC Limited
recognised on amalgamation to the special purpose financial 
information as at the appointed and effective date of the 
Scheme, audited by other auditors;
Ø
  T
ested the share swap and amalgamation adjustments for
appropriate recording of the resultant impact on the standalone 
reserves of the Bank;
Ø
  T
ested on a sample basis the underlying financial data of erstwhile 
HDFC Limited transferred to the Bank and its integration with the 
financial information of the Bank as on the effective date;
Ø
  Read communications of the Bank with the RBI seeking certain
forbearances r
elating to the operations of the Bank post the 
amalgamation, having an impact on the financial reporting and 
assessed their impact on the standalone financial statements;  
Ø
  Assessed the adequacy and appr
opriateness of the disclosures
relating to the amalgamation made in the standalone financial 
statements.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large 
number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the 
operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume 
of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) 
which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the 
related controls testing as a key audit matter because of the high 
level of automation, significant number of systems being used by 
the Bank for processing financial transactions, the complexity of the 
IT architecture and its impact on the financial records and financial 
reporting process of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
Ø
  In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding 
of the IT envir
onment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We 
evaluated and tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-
scope” IT systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant 
for our audit of the standalone financial statements and financial 
reporting process of the Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, 
we tested key IT general controls with respect to the following 
domains:
•
  Program change management, which includes that
pr
ogram changes are moved to the production 
environment as per defined procedures and relevant 
segregation of environment is ensured.
•
  User access management, which includes user access
pr
ovisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation 
of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, 
operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
•
  Pr
ogram development, which includes controls over IT
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting.
•
  IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring
and backup and r
ecovery.
Ø
  We also evaluated the design and tested the operating
ef
fectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key 
business process, which included testing automated controls, 
automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, 
segregation of duties and system generated reports, as 
applicable.
Ø
  W
e communicated with those charged with governance and
management and tested a combination of compensating 
controls or remediated controls and / or performed alternative 
audit procedures, where necessary.

and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
7.
 I
n preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
8.  O ur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 
9.  A
s part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
• I dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
• O btain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls. 
• E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management. 
• C onclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
HDFC Bank Limited
284
doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue 
as a going concern.  
• E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
10.
 W
e communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit. 
11.
 W
e also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
12.
 F
rom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the Standalone financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
13. T he special purpose financial information of erstwhile HDFC Limited as at the day beginning of July 1, 2023 (i.e. the appointed
and effective date for the Scheme) considered to give effect to the scheme as on that date was audited by other auditors, 
whose report expressing an unmodified opinion thereon, has been furnished to us by the Management. Our opinion is not 
modified in respect of above matter.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
14. I n our opinion, the Standalone Balance Sheet and the Standalone Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in
accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act. 
15.
 A
s required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:
(a)
 w
e have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary
for the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;
(b) th
e transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank, other than those 
relating to leasing of immovable properties acquired on amalgamation of the erstwhile HDFC Limited with the Bank, 
as disclosed in Schedule 18 note 1 to the Standalone Financial Statements; and
(c) d
uring the course of our audit, we have visited 90 branches to examine the books of account and other records
maintained at the branch and performed other relevant audit procedures. Since the key operations of the Bank are 
automated with the key applications integrated to the core banking system, the audit is carried out centrally at Bank’s 
Head office located in Mumbai, as all the necessary records and data required for the purposes of our audit are 
available there.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 16(g) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of HDFC Bank Limited on the 
Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under 
clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
1. W e have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited
(“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
2. T he Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
3. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
4.
 O
ur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone 
Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
5.
 W
e believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the Bank’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
6. A B ank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
HDFC Bank Limited
288
the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
7. B ecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
8. I n our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to
Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies 
Act, 2013. During the year, scheme for amalgamation 
of (i) erstwhile HDFC Investments Limited (“eHDFC 
Investments”) and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited 
(“eHDFC Holdings”) with and into erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation Limited (“eHDFC 
Limited”); and thereafter (ii) eHDFC Limited into the 
Bank became effective from July 01, 2023, upon receipt 
of all requisite approvals and accordingly the financial 
statements include the operations of eHDFC Limited,

2023 onwards. The Bank has overseas branch operations 
in Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit 
at International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City, 
India. The financial accounting systems of the Bank are 
centralised and, therefore, accounting returns are not 
required to be submitted by branches of the Bank. 
B  B ASIS OF PREPARATION
T he standalone financial statements have been prepared 
and presented under the historical cost convention and 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles in India (‘Indian GAAP’), statutory requirements 
prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars, notifications 
and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) 
from time to time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards 
(‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 
2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2021, in so far as they apply to banks.
U
se of estimates
T
he preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
Indian GAAP requires the management to make estimates 
and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
income and expenses for the reporting year. Management 
believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. The impact of 
any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively from the period of change.
C S IGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Investments
 
Classification:
I
n accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are 
classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” 
(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, 
Debentures and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / 
Joint Ventures and Other Investments.
P
urchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted 
on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
Bas
is of classification:
I
nvestments that are held for resale within 90 days from 
the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are classified under HTM 
category. Investments which are not classified in either of 
the above categories are classified under AFS category.
A
cquisition cost: 
C
osts, including brokerage and commission paid at the 
time of acquisition of investments and broken period 
interest on debt instruments, are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account and are not included in the cost 
of acquisition.
D
isposal of investments:
P
rofit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid 
three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Cost of investments is determined based on 
the weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of 
investment under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer 
to statutory reserve is appropriated from the Profit and 
HDFC Bank Limited
304
Loss Account to “Capital Reserve”, in accordance with 
RBI guidelines.
S
hort sale:
T
he Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT 
category and netted off from investments in government 
securities. The short position along with other government 
securities under HFT portfolio is marked to market and 
the resultant loss, if any, is charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit / Loss on short 
sale is recognised on settlement date.
 
Valuation:
• I
nvestments classified under AFS and HFT categories
are marked to market individually and depreciation 
/ appreciation is aggregated for each group. Net 
depreciation, if any, compared to the acquisition 
cost, in any of the six groups, is charged to the Profit 
and Loss Account. The net appreciation, if any, in 
any of the six groups is not recognised except to 
the extent of depreciation provided earlier. The book 
value of individual securities is not changed on such 
revaluation of investments.
• Q
uoted investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. 
(FBIL) or Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA). Investments denominated in 
foreign currencies are valued based on the prices 
provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
• U
nquoted Government of India securities, state
government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the Government 
of India are valued as per the prices published by 
FBIL. The valuation of other unquoted fixed income 
securities (viz. other approved securities and bonds 
and debentures), and preference shares, is done 
with appropriate mark-up, i.e. applicable FIMMDA 
published credit spread over the Yield to Maturity 
(YTM) rates for Government of India securities as 
published by FBIL.
• U
nquoted equity shares are valued at the break-
up value, ascertained from the company’s  latest 
balance sheet. The date as on which the latest 
balance sheet is drawn up shall not precede the 
date of valuation by more than 18 months. In case 
the latest audited balance sheet is not available or is 
more than 18 months old, the shares shall be valued 
at ` 1 per company.

units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are 
valued as per the net asset value provided by the 
issuing Asset Reconstruction Company and InvIT 
respectively.
 
• I
nvestments in unquoted units of Alternative
Investment Fund (AIF) are categorised, at the 
discretion of the Bank, under HTM category for 
an initial period of three years and valued at cost 
during this period. Such investments are transferred 
to the AFS category after the said period of three 
years. Investments in AFS category are valued 
at NAV provided by the AIF based on its financial 
statements. At least once in a year, units are valued 
based on the latest audited financials (not older than 
18 months) of the AIF, if available, or at ` 1 per AIF

in the units of AIFs is made in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines.
•
 P
ass Through Certificates (PTCs) including Priority
Sector-PTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit 
spread as applicable for the NBFC category, based 
on the credit rating of the respective PTC over 
the YTM rates for Government of India securities 
published by FBIL.
 
• I
nvestments classified under HTM category are
carried at their acquisition cost and not marked to 
market. Any premium on acquisition is amortised 
over the remaining maturity period of the security on 
a constant yield-to-maturity basis. Such amortisation 
of premium is adjusted against interest income from 
investments. Any diminution, other than temporary, 
in the value of investments in HTM category is 
provided for.

Overview Introduction Our Performance How We Create Value Our Strategy Responsible Business Statutory Reports and  
Financial Statements
SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
• N on-performing investments are identified and
provision are made thereon based on the RBI 
guidelines. The provision on such non-performing 
investments is not set off against the appreciation 
in respect of other performing investments. Interest 
on non-performing investments is not recognised 
until received.
2.    Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions
R
epurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse 
Repo) transactions are reported as borrowing and 
lending (lending above 14 days tenor reported as 
advances) respectively. 
B
orrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as 
interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions 
is accounted as interest income.
3.    Advances
 
Classification:
A
dvances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
loan loss provision, interest suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, 
provision for funded interest term loan and provision for 
diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
 
Provisioning:
       The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including 
at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised 
derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
S
pecific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI.
T
he specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing 
advances is also made based on the nature of product 
and delinquency levels.
N
on-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts written-
off are included under other income. 
Lo ans reported as frauds are classified as loss assets 
and fully provided for immediately without considering the 
value of security.
T
he Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also 
maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency 
exposures of borrowers, provision on loans to specific 
borrowers in specific stressed sectors, provision on 
exposures to step-down subsidiaries of Indian companies 
and provision on specified borrowers as prescribed by 
RBI. In the case of overseas branches, general provision 
on standard assets is maintained at the higher of the 
levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or 
RBI. The provision for standard assets is included under 
other liabilities.
I
n addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
P
rovision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of 
floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for non-
performing accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
F
urther to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect 
of that country where the net funded exposure is one 
percent or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for 
country risk is included under other liabilities.
       In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
HDFC Bank Limited
306
resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provision thereon is made in 
accordance with the said RBI guidelines. The restructured 
loans are upgraded into standard category as per the 
extant RBI guidelines. Further, in respect of restructuring 
of loans pertaining to projects under implementation, the 
asset classification and necessary provision thereon is 
made in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.
4. S
ecuritisation and transfer of assets
A
ssets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the 
Balance Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria 
being fully met with) and consideration is received. 
Sales / transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are 
accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct 
assignment transaction, the Bank recognises profit upon 
receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time 
of sale.
O
n sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than 
the net book value, the excess provision is credited to 
the Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum 
of cash received by way of initial consideration and / 
or redemption or transfer of security receipts issued by 
Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company 
(‘RC’) exceeds the net book value of the loan at the time 
of transfer.
I
n respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in  SRs 
issued against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 
percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding 
SRs are higher of the provisions required in terms of net 
asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions 
as per the extant norms applicable to the underlying 
loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as 
the corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans 
remained in the books of the Bank.
T
he Bank invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose 
Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted at acquisition cost 
and are classified as investments. The Bank also buys 
loans through the direct assignment route which are 
classified as advances. PTCs are carried at acquisition 
cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case 
the premium is amortised based on effective interest 
rate method.
T
he Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of 
participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the 
participation issued by the Bank is reduced from 
advances. In case where the Bank is assuming risk by 
participation, the aggregate amount of the participation 
is classified under advances. In the case of issue of 
participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount 
of participation issued by the Bank is classified under 
borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation 
certificate, the aggregate amount of participation acquired 
is shown as due from banks under advances.
5. F
ixed assets and depreciation
F
ixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised 
only when it increases the future benefit / functioning 
capability from / of such assets. 
D
epreciation is charged over the estimated useful life 
of the fixed asset on a straight-line basis except for 
freehold land. The management believes that the useful 
life of assets assessed by the Bank, pursuant to Part C 
of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, taking into 
account changes in environment, changes in technology, 
the utility and efficacy of the asset in use, fairly reflects its 
estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets. The estimated 
useful lives of key fixed assets are given below:
Asset Estimated useful life as 
assessed by the Bank
Owned Premises 60 years
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) 10 years
Electrical equipments and 
installations
6 to 8 years

8.  T
ranslation of foreign currency items
F
oreign currency income and expenditure items of 
domestic operations are translated at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Income 
and expenditure items of integral foreign operations 
(representative offices) are translated at the weekly 
average closing rates and of non-integral foreign 
operations (foreign branches and offshore banking units) 
at the monthly average closing rates.
O utstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic 
and integral foreign operations are translated at the 
closing exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange 
Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance 
Sheet date and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss 
is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
B
oth monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS - 
11, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates 
and the extant RBI guidelines.
 
F
oreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
9.
 F
oreign exchange and derivative contracts
F
oreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for 
valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater 
than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as 
well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For 
other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the 
forward points (for rates  / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv 
or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is 
considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the 
forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted 
to the valuation date using the discounting yields. The 
resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account. Marked to market value of 
foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when 
the fair value is positive or as liabilities when the fair value 
is negative.
T
he Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, 
on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered 
into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance 
Sheet date. Marked to market values of such derivatives 
HDFC Bank Limited
308
are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
T
he Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in 
some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception 
of the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
F
oreign exchange forward contracts and Principal only 
swaps (POS) not intended for trading, that are entered into 
to establish the amount of reporting currency required or 
available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are 
outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in 
accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are 
not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line 
basis as expense or income over the life of the contract. 
The interest income / expense on such POS transaction 
is accounted on accrual basis.
I
n case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair 
value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of 
cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of effective 
portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under 
‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an 
effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance 
in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging 
relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at 
the same time that the impact from the hedged item is 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
I
n relation to derivative contracts with non-performing 
borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount 
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive 
marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
10. R
evenue recognition
I
nterest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of non-
performing assets which is recognised when realised.
I
nterest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought 
out through the direct assignment route is recognised at 
their effective interest rate. 
I ncome on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is 
recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant 
yield basis.
D
ividend on equity shares and preference shares is 
recognised as income when the right to receive the div-
idend is established.
I
ncome from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on 
cash basis.
Lo

of contract. Other fees and commission income are 
recognised when due, where the Bank is reasonably 
certain of ultimate collection.
F

(PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the period 
of the certificate.
11. E
mployee benefits
S
tock based Employee Compensation:
T
he Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme -2022 
(ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock 
Units (units) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its 
employees and whole-time directors. The options / units 
granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these 
may be exercised within a specified period. 
T
he Bank followed the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect 
of options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation 
cost was measured by the excess, if any, of the market 
price of the underlying stock over the exercise price as 
determined under the option plan. The market price is 
the closing price on the stock exchange where there is 
highest trading volume on the working day immediately 
preceding the date of grant.

Q ualitative disclosure on LCR
T
he Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. 
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring 
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and 
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to 
improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, 
thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
T
he Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the 
Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest 
rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk 
tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk 
Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure 
to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management 
processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations 
is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their 
liquidity requirements with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their 
liquidity requirements under guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews 
the risk assessment of material risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to 
monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate.
I
n order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which 
include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which 
would cover all residual deposits). Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run 
down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, 
are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
T
he LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The 
present minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2024 is 100%.
I
n the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories 
of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related 
exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of 
run-off factors and the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:
Particulars Run-off factors
Retail Deposits 5% - 10%
Small Business Customers 5% - 10%
Operational deposits 5% - 25%
Non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs 40%
Other legal entities 100%

respectively for quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Bank has a significant portion of funding through deposits. As of  
March 31, 2024 the top 20 depositors comprised of 3.33% of total deposits indicating a healthy and stable deposit profile.

The threshold for provisioning is 5 per cent (Previous year: 10 per cent) of the reported profit before provisions and 
contingencies for the reference period and that for additional gross NPAs is 5 per cent (Previous year: 10 per cent) of 
the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period.

• Un hedged foreign currency exposure
T

memorandum prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange 
risk that the customer is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external 
commercial borrowings. It could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods 
adopted by the customer to mitigate exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined 
threshold the customer is encouraged to enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, 
the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of 
its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the risk. On a periodic basis, the Bank reviews information on the 
unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank 
exceeds a defined threshold. A Board approved credit risk rating linked limit on unhedged foreign currency position 
of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer. The compliance with the limit is assessed

erivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates, 
exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments 
recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the

floor spreads.

marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange 
risks), within the regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own 
account (trading activity) principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or

within the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.
HDFC Bank Limited

D erivative policy
T
he Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative 
business. The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor 
limits, sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at-
risk limits that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for 
approval. All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified 
by the market risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.
T
he Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative 
policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of 
business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various 
risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite 
and the customer’s requirements.
C
lassification of derivatives book
T
he derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the 
basis of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within 
the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
Hed
ging policy
F
or derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the 
hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of 
inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair 
value or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
T
he hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument 
may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management 
strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk 
embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the Balance Sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, 
the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and in case of cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, 
the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ 
and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The 
accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and 
Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish 
the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding 
at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to 
market and only translated at spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange 
contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract. The interest income / expense on such POS 
transaction is accounted on accrual basis.

as trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current 
exposure in non-centrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex 
(‘CSA’) agreements with some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.

provision is made for the entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value 
of non-performing derivative contracts.

the non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of 
non-compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the

periods beginning April 01, 2018 with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017. The implementation 
of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the

the necessary legislative amendments were expected. The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI are 
under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through its circular dated March 22, 2019, 
deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice.

has accordingly valued the same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2024 (previous year: Nil), towards 
the present value of the guaranteed interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as 
prescribed by the guidance note.

escription of contingent liabilities
Sr. 
No. Contingent liability* Brief description
1 Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - taxation
The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are 
pending. The Bank expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on 
decisions on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based 
on the facts of the case and taxation laws. 
2 Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - others
The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. 
The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on the Bank’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash 
flows.
3 Partly paid investments This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid 
investments. 
4 Liability on account of forward 
exchange and derivative contracts
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate 
agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants 
on its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts are 
commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted 
rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest 
/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest 
rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. 
The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts 
and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the 
Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows 
involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate 
the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market 
rates or prices relative to their terms. 
5 Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit 
and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of 
credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally 
represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of 
the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.
6 Other items for which the Bank is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills 
rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; 
e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI
under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).

Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated April 
01, 2023 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for 
such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The 
identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors 
like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated 
based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, 
nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification 
of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing 
Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, 
application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its 
significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
Ø
  Understood the pr
ocess and controls, and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
•  
 Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things
includes 
the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and 
drawing power;
•  
 Identification and classification of Non-performing
Advances 
in accordance with IRAC norms, other 
regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration 
of qualitative aspects; and
•  
 T
esting of application controls including testing of
automated controls and reports.       
Ø
   Evaluated 
the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that the 
basis of provisioning is in accordance with the Board of Directors 
approved policy and IRAC norms.
Ø
  
With respect to classification of Non-performing Advances,
verified the date of Non-performing Advances and recomputed 
the Days Past Due on a sample basis.
Ø
  
On a test check basis, verified the classification of accounts
reported by the Bank as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) 
in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits 
(‘CRILC’).
Ø
  
With respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing
Advances, provision calculations on a sample basis taking 
into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the 
IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our 
outcome to that prepared by the management and tested 
relevant assumptions and judgements which were used by the 
management.

Appropriateness of accounting for amalgamation of erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (“erstwhile HDFC Limited”) 
with the Bank, the related adjustments [including adjustments to and integration of Information Technology (IT) systems] and communications 
with RBI relating to the amalgamation
(Refer Schedule 18 Note 1)
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The composite scheme for the amalgamation of (i) erstwhile HDFC 
Investments Limited and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited into and 
with erstwhile HDFC Limited and (ii) erstwhile HDFC Limited into 
and with the Bank, (the “Scheme”) has been given effect to in the 
Consolidated Financial statements with effect from July 1, 2023 (i.e., 
the appointed and effective date for the Scheme), in accordance with 
the ‘pooling of interests’ method as prescribed in AS-14 “Accounting 
for Amalgamations”.
The amalgamation entailed transfer of various IT systems of the 
erstwhile HDFC Limited to the Bank, including integration of some 
systems with the financial reporting system and other related 
applications of the Bank; and transfer of underlying financial data of 
the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s business.
Further, the Bank had sought certain forbearances from the RBI. The 
RBI has granted certain forbearances and provided clarifications to 
the Bank through various communications.
Considering the magnitude of the amounts involved, complexity of 
the transaction and the related adjustments (including those related 
to IT systems impacting financial reporting) impacting Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and in view of its significance to the overall 
financial statements, we have determined the accounting for the 
amalgamation and the related adjustments (including those to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) and communication with RBI 
relating to the amalgamation, to be a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
Ø
  Understood the pr
ocess and controls, and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of key controls, including 
Information Technology general and application controls relating 
to accounting for amalgamations, and integration of IT Systems 
(impacting financial reporting) of erstwhile HDFC Limited; 
Ø

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large 
number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the 
operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume 
of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) 
which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the 
related controls testing as a key audit matter because of the high 
level of automation, significant number of systems being used by 
the Bank for processing financial transactions, the complexity of the 
IT architecture and its impact on the financial records and financial 
reporting process of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
Ø
  In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding 
of the IT envir
onment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We 
evaluated and tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-
scope” IT systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant for 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial 
reporting process of the Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, 
we tested key IT general controls with respect to the following 
domains:
•
  Program change management, which includes that
pr
ogram changes are moved to the production 
environment as per defined procedures and relevant 
segregation of environment is ensured.
•
  User access management, which includes user access
pr
ovisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation 
of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, 
operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
•
  Pr
ogram development, which includes controls over IT
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting.
•
  IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring
and backup and r
ecovery.
Ø
  We also evaluated the design and tested the operating
ef
fectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key 
business process, which included testing automated controls, 
automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, 
segregation of duties and system generated reports, as 
applicable.
Ø
  W
e communicated with those charged with governance and
management and tested a combination of compensating 
controls or remediated controls and / or performed alternative 
audit procedures, where necessary.

opinion on the special purpose consolidated financial statements of HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited (‘HDFC Life/ the 
Holding Company’ referred to in its report), a subsidiary of the Parent issued by Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants 
LLP and G. M. Kapadia & Co., independent firm of Chartered Accountants reproduced by us as under:
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Appropriateness of the Timing of Revenue Recognition in the proper 
period 
Refer Schedule 14 of the Special purpose consolidated financial 
statement and for accounting policy, refer Schedule 17 (8) of the 
Special purpose consolidated financial Statement. 
During the period, the Holding Company has recognised premium 
revenue of R 23,768 crores towards new business (first year premium 
and single premium). Out of the total revenue recognised, R 9,532 
crores were recognised during the last quarter.
This area was considered a key audit matter because of the significant 
concentration of revenue during the last quarter of financial period 
(including cut-off at the Balance sheet date). Due to the nature of the 
industry, revenue is skewed towards the balance sheet date. Hence, 
there is possibility that policy sales of the next financial year are 
accounted in the current period.
Our procedures included the following: 
•
   Understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating
ef fectiveness of process and controls relating to recognition of 
revenue (including testing of key controls for verifying that the 
revenue has been accrued in the correct accounting period).
•
  T
ested on a sample basis the policies at the period end to confirm 
if related procedural compliances with regard to acceptability of 
the terms of policy were completed before or after the period 
end to verify appropriate accounting of revenue. 
•
  Verified on a sample basis to verify that policy sales of the next
financial year ar
e not accounted for in the current period.  
•
  T
ested on a sample basis, the unallocated premium to
corroborate that there were no policies where risk commenced 
prior to balance sheet but revenue was not recognized. 
•
  T
ested the manual accounting journal entries relating to revenue
on a sample basis so as to identify unusual or irregular items. We 
agreed the journal entries tested to supporting evidence.
•
  T

case of products like Unit Linked Insurance Plan to confirm the 
recognition of the revenue in correct accounting period. 
Based on the work carried out, we did not come across any material 
exception which suggests that the revenue recognition is not 
accounted in the correct period

Directors of the Holding Company. Further, investments including 
derivative instruments (which involves complex calculations to value 
such instruments) should be valued as prescribed in the Investment 
Regulations which state the valuation methodology to be used for 
each class of investment. This area was considered as a key audit 
matter as the valuation of unlisted or not frequently traded investment 
involves management judgement. Also, due to events affecting 
the investee company’s rating, there could be a need to reclassify 
investment and assess its valuation / impairment per the requirements 
of the Investment Regulations and / or Holding Company’s internal 
policies.

2 Information Technology
IT systems and controls 
The Company’s financial reporting processes are dependent on 
technology considering significant number of transactions that 
are processed daily across multiple and discrete Information 
Technology (‘IT’) systems. The Financial accounting system 
of the Company is interfaced with several other IT systems 
including Loan Management & Originating systems and several 
other systemic workflows. 
IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that 
changes to applications and underlying data are made in an 
appropriate manner. Adequate controls contribute to mitigating 
the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to the 
applications and data. 
These includes implementation of preventive and detective 
controls across critical applications and infrastructure. 
Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology 
systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk 
assessment, we planned our audit by assessing the risk of a 
material misstatement arising from the technology as significant 
for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter.
In course of audit, our focus was on user access management, 
change management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation 
controls and system application controls over key financial accounting 
and reporting systems. We performed a range of audit procedures, 
which included: 
Ø

Key Audit Matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company’s investment portfolio has been bifurcated into 
Policyholders investments and Shareholders investments in terms of 
IRDAI guidelines. Total investments represent 87.38 percent of the 
Company’s total assets as at 31 March 2024. 
Investments amounting to INR 25,354.97 Crores are valued as per the 
Group Accounting Policy, based on which:
•       the listed equity shares, additional Tier I bonds and mutual fund
units have been valued at fair value; and
•       debt securities and unlisted equity shares are valued at historical
cost.
Investments in listed equity shares, additional Tier I bonds and 
mutual funds does not represent higher risk of material misstatement, 
however, is considered to be a key audit matter due to its materiality 
to the special purpose financial information. 
Further, investments in debt securities and unlisted equity shares are 
assessed for impairment as per the Company’s investment policy 
which involves significant management judgement. There is increased 
economic stress on account of external factors, which may impact the 
determination of impairment of these investments. 
Accordingly, valuation of investments (including impairment 
assessment) was considered to be one of the areas which required 
significant auditor attention and was one of the matters of most 
significance in the special purpose financial information.
Our audit procedures included the following: 
•
 U
nderstood the Company’s process and tested the controls on 
the valuation of investments; 
• E

1. IT Systems and controls
The financial accounting and reporting systems of the Company 
are fundamentally reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process 
significant transaction volumes. 
Automated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, which 
include IT governance, general IT controls over program development 
and changes, access to programs and data and IT operations, are 
required to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate 
financial reporting. 
Therefore, due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT 
environment, the assessment of the general IT controls and the 
application controls specific to the accounting and preparation of the 
financial information is considered to be a key audit matter. 
We performed the following procedures assisted by specialized IT 
auditors on the IT infrastructure and applications relevant to financial 
reporting:

Key Audit Matter How the audit was addressed in our audit
Investment Management Fee is a significant account balance in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Investment management 
fees from the Mutual fund consists of fees from various schemes 
which invest in different categories of securities in the market like 
Equity, Debt etc.
We have identified revenue from investment management service as a 
key audit matter since: 
1.     The calculation of investment management fees is a percentage
of the assets under management (‘AUM’) managed by the 
Company. There is a process wherein approved fee rates is 
a manual input in the system for computation of Investment 
Management Fee income. AUM is calculated by the system on 
a daily basis for each scheme.
2.      Multiple schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund require effective
monitoring over key financial terms and conditions being captured 
and applied accurately. Any discrepancy in such computations 
could result in misstatement of investment management fee 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence: 
Testing of Design and Operating Effectiveness of controls:-

requirements of AS 9;

management fee calculations and reconciled investment 
management fee to amounts included in the consolidated 
financial statements for completeness of income recognition;

approved by authorised personnel before being manually

schemes for such work and reconciled the certified amounts

the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 
of the Act, and the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and circulars and guidelines issued by 
the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
14. O ur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
15. A
s part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
• I dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• O btain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.

doubt on the ability of the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are

their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
6. A B ank’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Group are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Group; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
7. B ecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements,

by-line basis by adding together the like items of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenditure, after elimination

investing entity or where the objective of control is not to 
obtain economic benefit from their activities.  For certain 
investments, even though the shareholding may be below 
20%, the Group may be eligible for nominee directors in the 
investee company. Such investments are considered to 
be at par with other companies where investment may be 
bought and sold depending upon market condition. Right

to make estimates and necessary assumptions in the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) as at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported income and

derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
S

advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI. 
T
he specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing

I
n addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant

guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions

approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for non-
performing accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
F
urther to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country

ecuritisation and transfer of assets
A
ssets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet when they are sold (true sale 
criteria being fully met with) and consideration is received. 
Sales / transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are 
accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct 
assignment transaction, the Group recognises profit upon 
receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time 
of sale.
O
n sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price 
below the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less 
specific provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the 
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account and if the sale is 
for a value higher than the net book value, the excess 
provision is credited to the Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Account in the year when the sum of cash received by 
way of initial consideration and / or redemption or transfer 
of security receipts issued by Securitisation Company 
(‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) exceeds the net 
book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
I
n respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the Group in SRs 
issued against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 
percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding 
SRs are higher of the provisions required in terms of net 
asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions 
as per the extant norms applicable to the underlying 
loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as 
the corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans 
remained in the books of the Group. 
T
he Group invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose 
Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted at acquisition cost 
and are classified as investments. The Group also buys 
loans through the direct assignment route which are 
classified as advances. These are carried at acquisition 
cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case 
the premium is amortised based on effective interest 
rate method.
T
he Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of 
participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the 
participation issued by the Bank is reduced from 
advances. In case where the Bank is assuming risk by 
participation, the aggregate amount of the participation 
HDFC Bank Limited

is classified under advances. In the case of issue of 
participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount 
of participation issued by the Bank is classified under 
borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation 
certificate, the aggregate amount of participation acquired 
is shown as due from banks under advances.

2016 and the APS2 & APS7 issued by the Institute of 
Actuaries of India.
A b
rief of the methodology used is as given below:

he policy liabilities are valued on policy by policy
basis, i.e., each policy is valued separately.
2. T
he reserves for linked business (individual and
group) comprise unit reserves and non-unit reserves. 
The unit reserves are determined on the basis of 
NAV of the units outstanding as at the valuation date 
and non-unit reserves are calculated using gross 
premium valuation method.
3. T
he liabilities for individual non-linked non-
participating and participating business are 
calculated using gross premium valuation method 
and are subject to the minimum floor of surrender 
value. Additionally, individual non-linked participating 
policies also have a reference to the asset share of 
policies at valuation date.
4. T
he liabilities for one year renewable group protection
business are calculated on the unexpired risk 
premium basis. For other than one year renewable 
group protection business, the liabilities are 
calculated using gross premium valuation method.
5. T
he liabilities for the group non-linked savings
products are determined as the higher of policy 
account balances (including accrued interest /
bonuses) and reserves calculated by gross premium 
valuation method.

Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is 
guaranteed are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of 
India (IAI) has issued a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has 
accordingly valued the same and as at March 31, 2024, no provision is required (previous year:  Nil), towards the present 
value of the guaranteed interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by 
the guidance note.

Sr. 
No. Contingent liability* Brief description
1 Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - taxation
The Group is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are 
pending. 
The Group expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions 
on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the 
facts of the case and taxation laws.
2 Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - others
The Group is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash 
flows.
3 Partly paid investments This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid 
investments.
4 Liability on account of forward 
exchange and derivative contracts
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward 
rate agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank 
participants on its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts 
are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted 
rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest 
/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest 
rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. 
The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts 
and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the 
Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows 
involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate 
the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market 
rates or prices relative to their terms.
5 Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit 
and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of 
credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally 
represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of 
the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.
6 Other items for which the Bank is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills 
rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments;
e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI
under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF); g) Bank guarantees 
taken.

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS AND FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE RISKS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Be ing in the business of banking, as per the extant regulations, 
the Bank does not deal in any commodity, though, it can 
be exposed to the commodity price risks in its capacity as 
lender / banker to its customers. Currently, the Bank has open 
exposure in Precious Metals i.e., Gold / Silver and such open 
exposures in Gold / Silver are primarily on account of positions 
created from short term deposits under the Gold Monetization 
Scheme (GMS) raised from Customers and trading positions 
in Gold / Silver. These positions are managed similar to other 
foreign exchange exposures using spot, outright forwards 
and swap transactions in Gold/Silver and monitored as part 
of the trading portfolio within the stipulated trading risk limits 
viz. Net overnight open position limit, Intraday open position 
limit, Value-at-Risk limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level etc. that are 
defined in the Treasury Limits Package. In addition, Bank is 
authorized by RBI to import gold and silver and the exposure 
arising out of import of gold and silver on consignment basis 
is covered on back to back basis. The spot, forward and swap 
contracts, outstanding as on the Balance Sheet date and held 
for trading, are revalued at the closing spot and forward rates 
respectively as notified by FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India) and at interpolated rates for contracts of 
interim maturities. The USD / INR rate for valuation of contracts 
having longer maturities i.e. greater than one (1) year is implied 
from the applicable INR and USD swap curves. For other pairs, 
where the rates / tenors are not published by FEDAI, the spot 
and forward points are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for 
valuation of the foreign exchange deals. The foreign exchange 
profit or loss is arrived on present value basis thereafter, as 
directed by FEDAI, whereby the forward profits or losses on 
the deals, as computed above, are discounted till the valuation 
date using the applicable discounting yields. The resulting profit 
or loss on valuation is recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.

Gold Monetization Scheme deposits as of March 31, 2024.

The objective of ‘leading responsibly’ has been a tenet HDFC 
Bank has followed since its inception in 1994. This entails 
a commitment to delivering quality customer experiences, 
taking banking to the unbanked, supporting businesses, 
enabling smart banking, focusing on long-term sustainability 
and empowering communities. Unequivocally, the business of 
banking is underpinned by trust and as a responsible lender, 
the Bank stands committed to contributing to nation building.
FY 2023-24 marks an exceptional year, as it is the first 
year of reporting post the merger of the erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation Limited (e-HDFC) with 
HDFC Bank with effect from July 1, 2023. The rationale for the 
merger has been well articulated as have the synergies of the 
combined entity. Given the scale of the merger, as with the 
financials, there is a new starting point for non-financial metrics 
as well. Thus, the current year’s numbers are not comparable 
with that of the prior period.
Prior to the merger, an Integration Committee was set up 
to facilitate a seamless and effective integration. Having 
spearheaded the Integration Committee, suffice to say that 
ESG was among the core focus areas. Culture, people, 
processes and systems are the key pillars of building long-
term sustainable businesses.
The    board    believes    that    governance    and sustainability 
are inextricably linked and essential to ensure long-term value 
creation. Though ESG frameworks are still evolving, the Board 
is committed to deepening its oversight on ESG and climate-
related  disclosures.
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
With concerted effort, the Bank has seen a significant 
improvement in its diversity and retention ratios which 
augurs well. The Bank is committed to playing a meaningful 
role in supporting the government’s flagship schemes – be 
it micro-insurance, pensions, MSME funding and initiatives 
in digitalisation, agriculture, healthcare, livelihoods, amongst 
others. The Bank was awarded the ‘Conscious Corporate of 
the Year’ at the ET Awards, 2023 – an acknowledgement of our 
efforts on Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG.
During the year, the Bank raised its maiden international 
sustainable bond, which was well received by investors. 
The Bank has widened its coverage of wholesale loans that 
undergo Environmental and Social due diligence. Leveraging 
on the deep corporate relationships, the Bank recognises the 
importance of being enablers of transition financing to shift to 
cleaner energy pathways.
The Bank is committed to raising the bar on its ESG disclosures. 
More importantly, the Bank abides by the principles of integrity, 
transparency and accountability in its ESG reporting.

Accordingly, 6.76 tonnes of flex from 560 locations were collected and handed over to 5 cement companies. Certificates 
were obtained from the cement companies that the waste would be co-processed and the same was deemed as non-
hazardous waste.

towards sustainable management of waste generated from day-to-day operations. The Bank has formulated an internal 
Standard Operating Procedure to document its approach to waste segregation and handling in the office premises. The 
Bank segregates and recycles dry waste at select large offices. The dry waste from these offices is collected and disposed 
through authorised vendors who eventually recycle the waste. In FY 23-24, disposal of the Bank’s owned IT assets within its 
premises and its co-located datacenters led to the generation and recycling of 110.58 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 tonnes 
of battery waste. The e-waste and battery waste was handed over to authorized recyclers, thus ensuring circularity.
