Chairman’s Message 
Dear Shareholders,
It is my privilege to present to you the 
Integrated Annual Report of your Company for 
2022-23. It captures the essence of a year that 
reflects the milestones and values that define 
IndianOil, and how it has emerged as the 
harbinger of India’s energy transition journey. 
I feel proud that our dedicated team has 
consistently delivered outstanding results to 
enhance shareholders’ value. Let me reiterate 
that we remain committed to maintaining the 
highest standards of corporate governance, 
transparency, and accountability, ensuring 
that the interests of our stakeholders are 
safeguarded at every step.
I am happy to share that your Company’s 
performance in 2022-23 was indeed stellar 
across all operational fronts. During the year, 
your Company registered its highest-ever 
Revenue from Operations, at H9,34,953 Crore 
(Rupees Nine Lakh Thirty-Four Thousand 
Nine Hundred and Fifty-Three Crore). We 
also notched up a net profit of H8,242 Crore 
(Rupees Eight Thousand Two hundred and 
Forty-Two Crore), that underscores the 
inherent resilience that empowers us to rise 
above global challenges and make a mark. 
We also achieved the highest ever sales 
volume of 95.714 Million Metric Tonnes of 
products, cementing our leadership position 
in the business. Honours also rolled in as your 
Company made its mark among the ‘Top 10 
Strongest Oil and Gas Brands’ worldwide 
(Brand Finance Plc 2022 listing) and was 
also named as the ‘Most Loved Non-FMCG 
Brand’ by Kantar Brandz (2022).
It was also a year of shining milestones 
like silver jubilee celebrations of Panipat 
Refinery & Petrochemical Complex, and 
the Pipelines Division, golden jubilee of 
Bongaigaon Refinery and the diamond jubilee 
of Guwahati Refinery. 
Values that Steer India’s Energy 
Vision
I strongly believe that organisational 
success endures only when it is backed by 
an unwavering commitment to values that 
shine above business dimensions. The above 
numbers, milestones and accolades were 
delivered by our super-motivated energy 
soldiers, demonstrating the tenet of ‘Pehle 
Indian Phir Oil’ or Nation before business, in 
letter and spirit. Beyond our much-celebrated 
core values of Care, Innovation, Passion, and 
Trust, the spirit of ‘Nation-First’ is infused 
in our DNA and has turned your Company 
into the force it is today. Thus, in a natural 
progression, we have added another core 
value, ‘Nation-First, ’ to our existing values. To 
reiterate and reaffirm our commitment to our 
Values, the first Values Day was celebrated 
on June 30, 2023. This marks the landmark 
day in 1959, when Indian Oil Company Ltd., 
the precursor to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., 
was incorporated.
The journey of over six decades of energising 
India has been deeply fulfilling. We are geared 
to catalyse the country’s growth trajectory, 
as the energy custodians, and the architects 
of a brighter tomorrow. In specific terms 
your Company, has a distinct vision to drive 
India’s energy destiny. Currently, we have 
a 9% share in India’s energy pie, and we 
intend to increase our contribution to around 
1/8th or 12.5% by 2050. There is a concrete 
action plan to get there and establish your 
Company as a 360-degree energy company. 
The blueprint encompasses leveraging varied 
pathways to fulfil the rapidly growing energy 
demand of an ascendant India.
Taking on the green mantle
Under India’s G20 Presidency, ‘ensuring 
universal energy access and just, affordable, 
and inclusive energy transitions’ is a key 
priority, that echoes the need for striking a 
strategic balance while driving accelerated, 
inclusive, and resilient growth in the energy 
sector.
Beyond fuelling, we aspire to be the vitalising 
force in greening an ascendant nation. India’s 
resolve to achieve the Net-Zero Goal by 2070, 
defines this ‘New India’ , that is ambitious, 
socially empathetic, and environmentally 
sensitive. Aligning with these national targets, 
during the last Annual General Meeting, your 
Company committed itself to achieving Net-
Zero operational emissions by 2046, aiming 
to mitigate both Scope 1 & 2 emissions. 
This declaration is a defining moment in the 
history of your Company that demonstrates 
its firm resolve of leading India’s energy 
transition journey from the front. We already 
have a well-crafted blueprint in place with 
a multi-pronged approach to gradually take 
us towards the Net-Zero destination with 
an investment of around USD 30 Billion 
till 2046. The various emission mitigation 
pathways such as green hydrogen, biofuels, 
renewables, carbon offsetting, and Carbon 
Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) are 
already underway to steer the green journey. 
Powering Progress
While steering India’s green agenda, I 
must underline, that given India’s progress 
trajectory and geopolitical realities, it is 
imperative to strengthen our focus on the 
traditional business. 
The country’s energy demand is all set to go 
up as the Indian economy is pacing ahead, 
aiming for the USD 5 Trillion mark by 2025 
and USD 10 Trillion by 2030. In fact, the 
tumultuous geopolitical events that unfolded 
in 2022, led to the developed economies 
rearranging their energy baskets and lean 
towards conventional fuels. Let me assure 
you that we are focused on accelerating the 
traditional energy avenues, while shaping 
the green energy vision. Our physical 
performance of 2022-23 demonstrates the 
preparedness to cater to the rising demand, 
efficiently and sustainably. 
IndianOil made its mark among the 
‘Top 10 Strongest Oil and Gas Brands’ 
worldwide (Brand Finance Plc 2022 
listing) and was also named as the 
‘Most Loved Non-FMCG Brand’ by 
Kantar Brandz (2022).

achieved the highest ever crude processing 
volume of 72.4 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT). 
In fact, we continued to push boundaries 
to step-up the operational efficiency of the 
refineries, expanded the crude basket to 
add 36 new crude oil grades (reaching 247 
grades) and undertook multiple projects to 
strengthen our core capabilities. 
In August 2022, the Prime Minister 
inaugurated the 2G Ethanol Plant at 
Panipat, marking a significant milestone 
in sustainability. The first Wet Sulphuric 
Acid Plant was commissioned at Haldia, 
and the Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) unit 
at Gujarat was revamped. I am happy to 
share that your Company has formed a Joint 
Venture Company, ‘Cauvery Basin Refinery 
& Petrochemicals Ltd’ ., with the subsidiary 
Petrochemicals : Expanding footprints 
of success
Petrochemical integration is the way forward 
for us in all our refining investments, vital 
for mitigating the risks from business 
uncertainties, while enhancing the value of 
every molecule in the hydrocarbon chain. 
During the year 2022-23, we continued to 
make significant strides in this vital sector by 
expanding our petrochemical capacity from 
3.7 MMTPA to 4.1 MMTPA and attained an 
annual petrochemical sale of 2.23 MMT with 
a remarkable 4% growth in the Paraxylene 
(PX)/Para Terephthalic Acid (PTA) sales 
segment.
Your Company continues to drive progress 
and self-reliance in India’s petrochemical 
sector with strategic investments. These 
include implementing a 387 KTA Styrene 
unit and a 60 KTA Poly Butadiene Rubber 
(PBR) plant at Panipat to support the 
growing demand and reducing imports of 
Styrene and PBR. Moreover, the upcoming 
polyester yarn and fibre production facility at 
Bhadrak in Odisha will enhance downstream 
integration in the textile industry, promote 
resource efficiency and generate employment 
opportunities. 
The Board, in a key move, has approved 
setting-up of Paradip Petrochemical Complex 
in Odisha, at an estimated cost of over

other projects, the Board of the Company has 
recently announced issue of equity shares on 
Rights Basis to its existing shareholders, up 
to H22,000 Crore. The issue of equity shares 
would also improve the ability of the Company 
to raise debt for the projects. The shares are 
proposed to be issued during 2023-24, subject 
to statutory approvals.
The Green Umbrella Entity
We have set out to consolidate the existing

Chairman’s Message
Chairman and the Functional Directors with women IOCians on International 
Women’s Day 2023
Chairman with IOCians at Sanand Bottling Plant, Gujarat
Through diligent adherence to best practices 
and strict protocols, we ensure that an 
unwavering focus on the well-being of our 
people drives our progress. And genuine 
well-being must begin with inclusivity. 
On International Women’s Day 2023, we 
announced three crucial policy changes 
to further our goal of workplace equity. 
These changes focus on providing more 
flexible and compassionate maternity 
policies, complementing our existing efforts 
to empower women. Initiatives such as 
transportation support for women employees 
at touring locations and access to well-
equipped creche facilities have already been 
implemented. However, fostering a cultural 
shift that encourages both men and women 
to share family responsibilities is essential. By 
creating an equitable society, we can ensure 
that individuals can pursue their careers and 
family lives without sacrificing on either front. 
We remain dedicated to fostering the holistic 
well-being of IOCians. While we have a 
robust system in place for ensuring physical 
health of our team, we have now introduced 
counselling services through our Employee 
Assistance Programme ‘Paramarsh’ as a pilot 
project, in some of our offices in Delhi-NCR. 
The aim is to safeguard the mental wellness 
of our energy soldiers who are working hard 
amid challenges with aplomb.
Moreover, to nurture an impeccable 
safety culture in our workplaces, diligently 
adhering to best practices and strict 
protocols, the first IndianOil Safety Day was 
observed on October 29, 2022 in Jaipur. 
The commemoration also marked the 
inauguration of a memorial called ‘Smriti 
Sthal, ’ to pay homage to the precious lives 
lost, including those of the energy soldiers 
in the line of duty. The occasion served to 
reiterate the learnings from a major incident 
that took place at the location in 2009 and 
the resolve to uphold the highest safety 
standards while energising the country.
Talking of safety, road accidents of petroleum 
tank trucks (TT) have been known to cause 
disruption in public carriageways and often 
lead to fatalities, damage to public property 
and pollution. On an average, about 16,000 
tank trucks traverse almost 15 Lakh km daily, 
across varied terrains to deliver petroleum 
products across the country. Similarly, 24600 
vehicles for bulk and packed LPG ply almost 
25 Lakh km every day to fuel the kitchens 
across India.
To ensure safe driving conditions, the existing 
Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) was revisited 
and streamlined. Key parameters like speed, 
harsh manoeuvring, sudden braking, and 
acceleration were monitored, and accident-
prone zones were analysed across the 
country. Based on the findings, voice alerts 
were introduced for the drivers breaching the 
speed limit and plying of trucks during the 
night was brought down by 90%. I am happy 
to share that the focussed monitoring of the 
VTS has resulted in significant reduction in 
road accidents and fatalities.
As we look ahead, we are filled with great 
optimism for the future. We are committed 
Chairman with the President of Sri Lanka General Supply Agreement being signed with Nepal Oil Company
to leveraging our strengths, exploring new 
vistas, embracing exciting opportunities and 
driving continued growth and create value for 
our stakeholders and communities.
The best part is that we are spreading our 
wings in the vast horizon, beyond borders. 
Besides being the energy custodians of 
the nation, we are supporting India’s vision 
of strengthening the energy scenario of 
neighbouring countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka 
and Bangladesh, among others. 
Our journey is marked by a relentless pursuit 
of greatness, where each milestone achieved 
becomes a stepping stone to a brighter 
future. Undoubtedly, the voyage has been 
exciting and challenging in equal measures, 
but it has also been full of new opportunities, 
opening new vistas in the energy business. 
For us, the essence of true achievement lies 
not in numbers alone, but in the inspired 
souls, 1.4 Billion Indians who breathe life into 
those figures, reflecting the spirit of ‘Nation-
First’ in all that we do. 
Together, we form an indomitable force united 
in our quest to illuminate the path of progress 
for our beloved nation. Let us be the change 
we want to see in the world and cement our 
position as the ‘Energy of India’ . 
Thank you for your unwavering trust and 
support.

Macroeconomic  
Risk
Being a major player in the energy 
sector, we face various macroeconomic 
risks that can impact our operational 
and financial performance. One of the 
significant macroeconomic risks is 
the volatility in global crude oil prices. 
Economic factors such as geopolitical 
tensions, supply-demand dynamics, and 
global economic conditions can lead to 
price volatility, posing challenges for our  
financial stability and planning.
 Focus on robust operational 
performance and efficiency to offset 
risks.
 Diversified crude oil sources to 
mitigate supply uncertainties.
 Implementation of process 
innovations to achieve cost savings 
and enhance resilience.
  Dedicated team and channel partners 
to ensure uninterrupted energy 
supply.
 The operations team takes the 
necessary steps to reduce fuel and 
energy consumption, as well as 
monitor other expenditures, in order 
to improve margins and profitability.

Currency 
Exchange Risk
As we are engaged in international 
trade and procurement of crude oil and 
petroleum products, we are exposed 
to currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
Changes in exchange rates can impact 
the cost of imports and exports, affecting 
our profitability. In addition, a significant 
part of our borrowing is also in foreign 
exchange and any depreciation of the 
rupee results in additional rupee outgo.
 The finance team continuously monitors 
the macro and micro-economic 
environment to identify potential risks 
that may impact the business.
 Fluctuations in exchange and interest 
rates are regularly assessed, and 
appropriate hedging is implemented 
according to approved policies.

Materiality Assessment
Addressing and Identifying 
Critical Factors 
To ensure long-term value creation for stakeholders, we strive to identify 
material issues that are critical for our success in a dynamic operating 
landscape. With a comprehensive evaluation of potential environmental, 
social, and governance issues that may have an impact on our performance, 
we undertake materiality assessments to create sustainable value. 
The materiality assessment conducted in 2021-22 helped to evaluate critical issues that are of utmost importance to our stakeholders.  
The materiality matrix is prepared in alignment with established global norms such as GRI, UNGC, UNSDGs, and so on. For shortlisting 
of material issues identified through stakeholder engagement exercises, we undertake a structured process, involving extensive 
discussions with the management.

At IndianOil, India’s 
foremost integrated 
and diversified energy 
company, we are driven 
by a strong commitment 
to conduct business with 
careful consideration and 
responsibility. 
Empowering Trust through Governance
Determined to Foster a Culture of 
Transparency and Accountability
IndianOil upholds a robust governance structure firmly rooted in the 
principles of transparency, integrity, and accountability. It enables the 
Company to adhere to the highest standards of ethical and responsible 
business practices to maximise value for all stakeholders including 
shareholders, customers, employees, contractors, vendors and communities. 
Our continuous commitment to remain aligned with the best emerging 
practices allows us to nurture stakeholder trust, build enduring relations 
and prepare us to successfully accomplish our objectives. 
Visionary Leadership Guiding Strategic Direction
Fostering a Culture of Integrity
We place paramount importance on upholding exemplary corporate governance standards and fostering visionary leadership. The 
Board of Directors assumes a pivotal role in providing strategic direction, setting an unwavering ethical foundation, and driving effective 
decision-making. Their independent and well-informed judgment serves as a guiding force for crucial determinations, seamlessly 
integrating strategic initiatives, risk management, performance optimisation, and sustainable development considerations into the fabric 
of IndianOil’s business practices.
We believe that a strong organisational culture is crucial to our success. Therefore, our Board’s influence extends to shaping our culture 
by defining our visionary mission, strategic pursuits, and core values. By fostering an environment that prioritises integrity, responsibility, 
and ethical conduct, we empower ourselves as a conscientious and forward-thinking corporate entity. This strong cultural framework 
enables us to seize emerging market opportunities while promoting a governance framework that continuously generates value for all 
our stakeholders.
To ensure adherence to relevant laws and 
regulations, we have established a robust 
Code of Conduct (CoC) which serves 
as a guiding framework for all Directors 
and employees of the Company. Our CoC 
underscores the importance of personal 
and professional integrity, honesty, and 
ethical conduct, and we encourage all 
individuals associated with us to abide by 
these principles.
We have framed a Whistle-blower Policy as 
a cornerstone of our commitment to integrity 
and ethical conduct. The policy serves as 
a tool to reinforce the CoC, inspiring each 
director and employee to embrace positive 
actions that align with our core beliefs.
The Whistle-blower Policy empowers every 
individual within the organisation, including 
Directors and employees, to report any 
instances of improper acts. This serves as 
a safeguard against any form of victimisation, 
ensuring that individuals can come forward 
without fear or hesitation.

A Year of Firsts
To meet the growing demands for 
petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) in the 
country, we have embarked on an ambitious 
capacity expansion plan. By 2026, our 
approved projects will significantly increase 
our crude oil refining capacity from the 
current 70.05 MMTPA to 87.9 MMTPA. We 
have diversified our crude oil sources by 
incorporating thirty-six new grades of crude 
from various regions, including Africa, the 
Middle East, America, Russia, and other 
locations. This strategic move allows us 
to enhance our crude basket, to deliver a 
wider range of feedstocks and optimise our 
refining processes to produce high-quality 
petroleum products efficiently. Through 
these initiatives, we are committed to 
fulfilling the country’s growing demand for 
POL products, enhancing energy security 
and contributing to the nation’s economic 
development.

action and a commitment to sustainable 
practices. As part of our efforts to address 
this imminent threat, we are dedicated 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
transitioning to cleaner and renewable energy 
sources, improving energy efficiency, and 
implementing sustainable land-use practices. 
We have taken concrete steps to manage 
and minimise GHG emissions generated 
from our operations.
To promote sustainable development, 
we have implemented initiatives such as 
rainwater harvesting, water, carbon, and 
waste footprint mapping, as well as the 
installation of solar panels and LED lights. 
Additionally, sapling plantations have 
been carried out at pipeline installations 
to contribute to carbon sequestration and 
environmental preservation.
Achieving Net-Zero Emissions by 2046
At IndianOil, we have recently resolved to 
achieve Net-Zero operational emissions by 
the year 2046. The decarbonisation plans 
encompass both Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
with an estimated budget requirement of 
more than H 2.4 Lakh Crore.
To achieve the Net-Zero target, we plan to 
have transparent and accurate accounting of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It involves 
regular monitoring, reporting, and verification 
of emissions. We also plan to reduce Scope 
1 and 2 emissions by investing in renewable 
energy, energy efficiency, compressed biogas, 
green hydrogen, CCUS/sapling plantation, 
and carbon markets.

Energy Management 
Energy conservation is a vital component 
in our journey towards a sustainable and 
greener future. By adopting energy-efficient 
practices and embracing renewable energy 
sources, we can significantly reduce our 
carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, 
and create a cleaner and healthier 
environment for future generations.
From rooftop solar installations to innovative  
indoor solar cooking systems and pilot trials 
of alternative fuel blend, IndianOil is actively 
contributing towards a circular economy, with 
an emphasis on a greener future.
In 2022-23, 119 energy conservation 
schemes (in-house, PCRA-identified and 
EIL-identified) were implemented across 
the refineries, helping achieve energy 
savings of 2,55,379 SRFT/yr, equivalent to 
monetary savings of H 840 Crore/yr. In total, 
approximately 0.81 MMT equivalent CO 2 
emission per year was achieved. 
The refineries showcased exceptional energy utilisation performance, achieving a remarkable MBN of 68.0. This achievement 
marks a significant improvement, with a 7.6% reduction compared to the previous year of 2021-22, and an impressive 
4.2% decrease from the previous best recorded in 2018-19, which stood at 71.0. Moreover, the refineries reached yet 
another milestone by attaining an outstanding Energy Intensity Index (EII) of 96.1. This accomplishment demonstrates a 
7.6% decrease from the previous year and a remarkable  1.9% improvement from the previous best recorded in 2018-
19, which stood at 97.9. These achievements highlight the refineries’ commitment to efficient energy utilisation and their 
continuous efforts to optimise operations.

aims for the successful rollout of the Solar 
cooktops in the market.
IndianOil’s commitment to renewable energy 
is further exemplified by the recent unveiling 
of a double cooktop variant of the indoor 
solar cooking solution during the Indian 
Energy Week 2023, graced by the Honourable 
Prime Minister.
Our R&D Centre has developed an innovative 
indoor solar cooking system - a stationary, 
rechargeable, cooking solution that caters 
to the needs of Indian households. 
Currently, 50 units of the Solar Cooktop 
have been deployed for pilot trials across 
five different cities in India, including Leh, 
Lakshadweep, Gwalior, Udaipur, and 
Delhi-NCR. The trials, which consider solar 
radiation intensity and cooking habits, are 
currently in progress. Moreover, IndianOil has 
collaborated startin with 10 Indian vendors 
for the manufacturing, marketing, installation, 
IndianOil has collaborated with 10 
Indian vendors for the manufacturing, 
marketing, installation, and after-sales 
service of Solar Cooktop.
Adopting Renewable Energy
At Paradip Refinery, a significant step has 
been taken towards renewable energy 
adoption with the installation of 1.87 MW 
capacity solar panels over the roof of the 
warehouse. This solar power generation 
facility helps reduce the reliance on 
conventional power sources and promotes 
the use of clean energy. Moreover, at the 
IndianOil Bulk Explosives Plant in Umrer, 
Nagpur, a 13 kW off-grid solar power project 
with battery backup has been completed. 
This project caters to the entire electrical 
load of the administrative building, further 
emphasising IndianOil’s commitment to 
sustainable energy solutions.
In addition, we are actively contributing to 
the renewable energy sector with our current 
renewable energy capacity of 238.7 MW. 
Through a recent collaboration with NTPC 
Green Energy Limited, we are poised to 
significantly augment our renewable energy 
capacity by approximately 2 GW.

Water Management 
Efficient management of water resources 
play a crucial role in building a sustainable 
future. By adopting sustainable practices, 
we can address water scarcity, protect 
aquatic ecosystems, support agriculture, 
and ensure reliable water supply for both 
human and environmental needs. In line with 
these objectives,  IndianOil Refineries have 
been actively monitoring their fresh water 
consumption on a monthly basis. 
Yearly targets for specific fresh water, 
treated effluent reuse, and specific 
effluent discharge have been strictly 
adhered to, resulting in an 89% 
recycling of treated wastewater in 
Financial Year 2022-23.

Reuse and Conserve
Keeping water consumption in check
In an effort to promote water reuse, a 
notable project has been initiated at Mathura 
Refinery in the year 2022-23. The project 
focuses on utilising treated effluent from 
city municipal Effluent Treatment Plants 
(ETPs) for non-drinking purposes within the 
refinery. Currently, the refinery is replacing 
8 Million Litres per day (MLD) of fresh river 
water with treated water. The project is 
currently undergoing final trials, and once 
fully operational, it will significantly contribute 
to reducing freshwater consumption and 
promote efficient use of water.
Similar efforts are being made at Gujarat 
Refinery, where a project for reuse of sewage 
treatment plant (STP) water is in its final 
stages. In the first phase, 21 MLD of treated 
water from Rajiv Nagar STP in Vadodara 
will be utilised within the refinery for non-
drinking and sanitation purposes. This project 
is aligned with the Government of Gujarat 
Policy and is expected to further enhance 
water conservation and reuse efforts in the 
region. Additionally, plans are underway 
for the commissioning of a second phase, 
which will result in a total reuse of 40 MLD 
of treated wastewater by 2025-26.
Recognising the importance of efficient 
water management, a comprehensive 
water consumption study was undertaken 
for all IndianOil Refineries, including 
CPCL, in collaboration with the Centre 
for High Technology, under the Ministry 
of Petroleum and Natural Gas. The study, 
conducted in 2019, involved an extensive 
survey to assess consumption patterns and 
identify opportunities for enhanced water 
reuse. Based on the findings, short-term 
and long-term measures were developed, 
along with reduction targets and time-
bound action plans. These concerted efforts 
resulted in significant freshwater savings of  
360 m 3/hr in 2022-23, against savings of  
446 m3/hr in 2021-2022.

Waste Management 
To promote conservation of resources 
and minimise our imprint on the planet, 
it is essential to adopt efficient waste 
management practices across our operations. 
We strictly adhere to the Hazardous & Other 
Wastes (Management and Transboundary 
Movement) Rules, 2016, during the storage, 
recycling, transport and disposal of hazardous 
wastes generated within our facilities. By 
adhering to regulatory norms, we effectively 
reduce emissions and hazards associated 
with waste generation.
Mechanical and Chemical Recycling Reducing Plastic Waste
Our emphasis on a circular economy 
allows us to actively manage waste through 
mechanical, chemical and biological recycling 
methods. Our research on mechanical 
recycling explores innovative applications 
for waste plastic-based bituminous roads, 
crumb rubber modified bitumen, poly bags 
for bitumen packaging, and paver blocks. 
Additionally, our chemical recycling efforts 
involve the conversion of various categories 
of single-use waste plastic including thin 
carry bags, multi-layer packaging, thermocol 
and mixed plastic into liquid hydrocarbon 
oils, waxes, value-added chemicals, 
petrochemical feedstock and high-quality 
fuels compliant with BS-VI standards.
Furthermore, we have made significant 
strides in reducing our environmental 
footprint. For instance, we have increased 
the packaging capacity of our PTA plant 
bags from 1100 kg to 1150 kg, resulting in 
the reduction of approximately 11,000 jumbo 
bags and 30.8 MT of plastic per year, for 
recycling purposes.
Continuing its commitment to a sustainable and greener environment, SERVO 
introduced a significant initiative by launching a new container made with 30% 
PCR (Post-Consumer Recycled) plastic. This innovative step showcases SERVO’s 
dedication to reducing plastic waste and promoting the use of recycled materials in 
its packaging. By adopting such eco-friendly practices, SERVO is actively contributing 
to a more sustainable future and reinforcing its position as a responsible and 
environmentally conscious brand.
E-Waste Management
We also engage in e-waste management to 
ensure its proper disposal through buyback 
schemes, ensuring efficient recycling of 
electronic equipment. These initiatives help 
to fulfil our commitment to drive a circular 
economy and promote sustainable practices. 
Effective Treatment of Hazardous Waste
When it comes to the disposal of hazardous 
waste, we adopt various methods. Spent 
catalysts containing recoverable metals are 
sold to authorised recyclers approved by local 
SPCBs (State Pollution Control Boards). Non-
recyclable spent catalysts are either sent to 
approved TSDFs (Treatment, Storage, and 
Disposal Facilities) or deposited at common 
Hazardous Waste Disposal sites. Silicate-
containing spent FCC (Fluidised Catalytic 
Cracking) unit catalysts are disposed of to 
cement industries, where they are utilised 
as feed admixture.
To handle oily sludge, we employ heat 
treatment and centrifugation techniques to 
separate the oil, which is then reprocessed 
within the refinery. The remaining sludge 
undergoes bioremediation to achieve an oil 
content of less than 1%. The bioremediated 
residual sludge is either disposed of for 
horticultural purposes or used within the 
refinery for construction purposes.
IndianOil has taken a pioneering 
step to contribute towards a circular 
economy by commissioning Wet 
Sulphuric Acid Plant at 
Haldia Refinery. This innovative 
initiative adds value to the elemental 
sulphur that refineries typically 
produce, promoting more sustainable 
and efficient utilisation of resources.
IndianOil has launched an initiative 
called ‘Unbottled, ’ which aims 
to promote the use of recycled PET 
bottles as a raw material for creating 
fabric, rather than sending them to 
landfills. This program has played a 
vital role in supporting the introduction 
of sustainable and environment-
friendly uniforms for around 3 Lakh 
IndianOil Retail Outlet  
Customer Attendants and Indane 
LPG Delivery Personnel. It is estimated 
that this initiative will annually recycle 
around 20 Million  discarded 
PET bottles, making a significant 
contribution to reducing waste and 
promoting sustainability.

Directors’ Report
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my privilege to present 
the 64th Annual Report and the 6th Integrated Annual Report of the 
Company for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2023, along with 
the Audited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Statements 
and Auditor’s Report thereon.
The year 2022-23 was excellent for the Company as it 
demonstrated remarkable resilience to achieve significant 
milestones in operational performance, despite various challenges. 
Your Company ensured accelerating the progress of the Indian 
economy, which was amongst the fastest growing economies 
in 2022-23. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine 
continues to have significant ramifications, not just for the two 
countries involved but also for the global economy. Despite the 
global energy sector experiencing waves of volatility, IndianOil 
remained committed to fueling the nation with excellence.

and ₹1,23,914 Crore to the States Exchequer compared to ₹1,57,181 Crore

vending machines. The revenue generated by the school is used  
to top-up next lot of sanitary pads.
Solar Tentacle Fencing at Kaundinya Wildlife Sanctuary
Kaundinya Wildlife sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh is home to a large population of Asian elephants. Due to human population residing in 
nearby areas of the forest land, there has been continuous rise in the human-elephant conflicts leading to human and elephant deaths 
along with loss and damage to crops and property.
To mitigate the human-elephant conflicts, IndianOil collaborated with Andhra Pradesh Forest Department for conducting conflict mitigation 
workshops for the villagers, specialised training for forest rangers/mahouts and erection of tentacle hanging solar fencing at vulnerable 
stretches to restrict Elephants movement into human habitations and agriculture farm-lands. Tentacle hanging solar fencing consists of 
steel wires hung in a row from a three-metre-high horizontal overhead wire supported by posts on both ends. The wires are connected to 
a solar power system and elephants get a mild irritation if they try to cross through the hanging wires. The electric fence is non-lethal and 
acts as a psychological barrier rather than a physical one. When the fencing wires are cut or tampered with, a built-in alarm immediately 
alerts the monitoring personnel and the security authorities. Around 5 km of vulnerable stretch was identified and solar fencing has been 
successfully erected.

 Executive Summary of Impact Assessment
 IndianOil has been working with the communities and 
geographies where it operates by supporting numerous 
initiatives connected with health, family welfare, education, 
environment protection, potable water, sanitation, 
empowerment of women and other marginalised groups. Six 
CSR projects implemented by IndianOil were picked for an 
impact evaluation to understand and evaluate the direct and 
indirect impacts created across beneficiary and stakeholder 
groups. 
 The study of these 6 projects were conducted by Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu India LLP on behalf of IndianOil. The 
study included interaction with beneficiaries that were 
selected using random sampling strategy with a probability 
proportionate to size method. The data collection process 
was executed by physical visits to the relevant project sites to 
interact with relevant stakeholders and beneficiaries based on 
the nature of the project. Summary of the assessment report 
is as under:

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition
 IndianOil Vidushi 
 IndianOil Vidushi scheme has encouraged higher education 
among girl children by providing them free of cost coaching 
and mentoring for State and National level Engineering 
Examinations. The study reflects that the support offered by 
IndianOil had enabled the beneficiaries’ access to quality 
education and enhance income opportunities. As a result, 
over 80% (in 2018-19) and 67% (in 2019-20) of students 
qualified for JEE mains. ~73% (in 2018-19) and 65% (2019-20) 
got admission to IIT/NIT/Government Institutes. In 2020-21, 
78% cleared the JEE Mains and 70% got admissions in IIT/
NIT/other government colleges. The economic aid offered 
by the program has contributed and created more equal 
opportunities for students from all types of backgrounds 
inclusively. The program has seen 22% GEN, 21% OBC, 19% 
SC and 38% ST category enrolment.
 Assam Oil Division Hospital, Digboi, Assam
 The hospital has been providing healthcare services to the 
villages/communities in and around Digboi and been found 
impactful. The study found that most of the respondents were 
extremely satisfied with the treatment they were receiving 
either free of cost, or at a subsidised cost. More than 16000 
outside patients were treated in 2018-19 and 2019-20 
whereas ~4100 outside patients were treated at the hospital 
in 2020-21. The hospital remains the most preferred choice for 
the communities including the marginalised and vulnerable 
other than IndianOil employees and their dependents. 
Approximately 91% of the respondents expressed satisfaction 
with the medical services received and only 9% felt the need 
to visit other hospital due to lack of availability of beds, staff, 
and specialised treatment.
 Swarna Jayanti Samudayik Hospital (SJSH), Mathura 
 SJSH is a 50 bedded facility with 10 beds reserved exclusively 
for patients Below Poverty Line (BPL). Additionally, 54 beds 
were added in the year 2021, in view of the surge in COVID 
cases across the nation, SJSH was temporarily converted into 
a COVID Hospital. The hospital offers treatment facility for 
public at a very nominal rate compared to any other private 
hospital in the region. More than 30,000 patients were treated 
in 2020-21 and more than 1.5 Lakh patients since 2018. Out 
of all the beneficiaries, 56% have annual income of less than 
₹ 1.5 Lakh. Under this initiative BPL families are given free 
treatment. 
 Installation of rainwater harvesting systems in 
Government primary schools in Vadodara, Gujarat
 Installation of rooftop rainwater harvesting units in 
government schools has enabled groundwater recharge 
with limited efforts of only maintenance of the units and has 
also improved the quality of water by reducing hardness. 
Vadodara became the first district in the country to harvest 
rainwater in all government primary and secondary schools 
including the rural areas of the district. Under this initiative, 
all 732 government schools were covered, wherein rainwater 
harvesting system were installed. The rainwater harvesting 
model has the potential to collect a cumulative 1000-1200 
Lakh litre rainwater.
 'Nai Disha': Provision of dual desk benches in 24 Govt. 
schools at Ranga Reddy district of Telangana
 The donated benches to the schools that have limited 
infrastructure for students added value by making schools 
more attractive for students in the local region, as a result of 
IndianOil’s intervention. The initiative of IndianOil provided 
benefits to around 1500 students in the schools in Ranga 
Reddy District that are owned and operated by the Zila 
Parishad. The high school students (8 th standard to 10 th 
standard mostly) are the beneficiaries. Parents begun to have 
faith in the schools for offering fundamental infrastructure. 
These benches were made by the inmate of Chanchalguda 
Jail in Hyderabad who were offered daily wage for the services 
rendered during period of sentence. It developed confidence 
in Central Jail inmates that they can acquire skills to maintain 
a stable livelihood.
 Support to Mother’s milk bank in Dharmapuri, Tamil 
Nadu
 The Mother Milk Bank has helped in reducing the infant 
mortality amongst pre-term babies. Additionally, babies with 
sick mothers also receive the donated milk. The healthcare 
offered to the infants is appreciated by the families and 
the donors of mother’s milk. More than 12,300 donors 
have accessed the facility to donate the milk benefitting 
around 3900 infants admitted to the hospital. The initiative 
has educated the mothers and family members about the 
importance of maternal care. The technology products 
supplied under the CSR initiative of IndianOil are having direct 
and indirect impact on the lives that are saved in the facility.

Management’s Discussion & Analysis
The Company is fast transforming itself from being India’s flagship 
national oil company to being India’s foremost holistic energy 
solutions provider. During the year, the Company set a target 
of increasing its share in the Indian Energy Basket from 1/11 th 
presently to 1/8 th by 2040. A massive scale-up in the Company’s 
operations, reach and spread has thus been envisaged, in line with 
its vision of being ‘The Energy of India’ . The Company envisages 
maintaining its leadership position in downstream oil, while sizably 
scaling its share and building a stronghold in the fast-growing 
alternate energy and natural gas sectors in India.
To orient itself with the nation’s COP26 commitment, the Company 
is making significant strides in ‘Crafting a Green Future’ by 
expanding its business portfolio for ‘sustainable and affordable 
energy solutions for tomorrow’ . During the year, the company 
fructified its commitment to achieve Net-Zero (operational 
emissions) by 2046. The Company is working tirelessly to make 
its conventional product offerings greener and reduce its carbon 
footprints while also swiftly foraying in a big way in alternate 
energy solutions.
Fuelled by the mission to ‘Propel the Nation’ and the zeal of being 
‘On Duty Always’ , the Company has embraced its 5 th Value of 
‘Nation-First’ , in addition to its  existing values of Care, Innovation, 
Passion & Trust.  These values will be the guiding light for the 
Company’s actions and plans. 
GLOBAL ECONOMY
The tumultuous year saw global inflation rates flaring to record high, 
driven by multiple drivers, including commodity price increases, 
aggravated by the Russia - Ukraine war, supply chain bottlenecks 
and strong policy-supported resurgence in demand from the lows 
of the pandemic. Global inflation increased to 8.8% in 2022 (annual 
average) from the pre-pandemic (2017–19) levels of about 3.5%. To 
contain the surging inflation, globally central banks tightened the 
monetary policy and raised interest rates at a pace not seen in the 
last 50 years, resulting in increased cost of borrowing globally. 
During the year, global economic growth slipped to 3.4% from 
6.3% in 2021. Erosion in household purchasing power due to high 
inflation, coupled with supply uncertainty (especially in the context 
of energy supplies) weighed on demand in many economies and 
was compounded by high borrowing costs and weakening of 
currencies of many developing economies. In China, the Covid 
surge and the Zero Covid policy, along with the ongoing stress in 
the property sector, restrained economic activity, dipping growth 
to its lowest in the last 40 years (barring 2020).

GDP Growth (%)
In the first quarter of 2023, consumer price inflation had come off 
from its peaks in most economies due to the softening in energy 
and commodity prices and easing of supply chain bottlenecks. 
Central banks shifted towards smaller hikes, and many indicated 
a pause in rate hikes. The reopening of the Chinese economy 
towards the end of 2022 helped it to turn around and is expected to 
have a positive impact on global activity. On the other hand, recent 
events in the global banking sector pointed towards the stress, 
especially in the small & regional US banks and associated fears 
of a global contagion. Overall, global economic growth is expected 
to slip further to 2.8% in 2023 from the impact of global monetary 
tightening and the prevailing high interest rates. Moreover, inflation 
though softened, remains sticky and above the central banks’ 
comfort targets for most economies, hence there is a lurking risk 
of financial vulnerability.
INDIAN ECONOMY
During the year, India overtook the UK to become the fifth largest 
economy in the world. Indian economy posted a strong growth 
of 7.2% in 2022-23, albeit slower than 9.1% posted in 2021-22, 
nevertheless standing out as the 2nd fastest growing large economy, 
second only to Saudi Arabia. In a year marked by record high oil 
prices and heightened economic woes for many developing 
economy oil importers, strong growth by India – the world’s 3 rd 
biggest oil importer, stands as a testament to the Indian economy’s 
innate strengths. 
India’s large domestic market drove domestic consumption and 
helped the economy weather the global headwinds.  Private final 
consumption grew by 7.5% and propelled the economy even as 
the Government’s final consumption slowed stagnated at 0.13% 
growth. Consumer confidence on the current economic situation, 
after being shaky for some time, improved during the course of the 
year. A sustained turnaround in investment was witnessed too, with 
9.6% growth during the year, on top of 18% growth in the previous 
year. The investment turnaround has been concomitantly backed 
by the Government’s continued strong capex push which crowded 
in private investments as well.  On the supply side, agriculture 
continued to support growth, but the main thrust of growth was from 
the services sector, where growth accelerated to 9.5% from 8.8% 
in the previous year. The services have traditionally been the main 
driver of growth for the Indian economy but had been the hardest 
hit by the pandemic and the lockdown. However, with normalization 
and return of high contact services such as hotels, restaurant and 
tourism, growth in the services bounced back strongly.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition
India's GDP & Sectoral Growth Rates (% ) 
In the backdrop of high global commodity prices, India too faced 
high inflation rates during the year, with retail inflation averaging at 
6.65% during 2022-23, exceeding the RBI’s targeted range of 2%-
6%. To control the runaway inflation, the Reserve Bank of India(RBI) 
implemented an aggregate 250 bps hike through its rate hike cycle 
that began in May 2022, pushing borrowing costs back to 2019 
levels. The Rupee depreciated by 7.3% during 2022-23 on account 
of continued strengthening of the US Dollar internationally, foreign 
portfolio capital outflows, and rising import bill, driven by high 
commodity prices. However, the Rupee performed far better than 
its peers, supported by the RBI’s foreign exchange interventions, 
increased interest rates, and continued FDI inflows. The country’s 
large holding of foreign exchange reserves built judiciously over 
the years and especially ramped up during the pandemic years 
provided an adequate buffer against global spill-overs.
Looking ahead, in 2023-24, growth is expected to be moderate on 
account of slowing global growth, geopolitical tensions, financial 
market volatility and tightening global financial conditions. 
Nevertheless, India is set to be the fastest growing large economy 
backed by sound macro management, the Government’s focus on 
capital expenditure and an overall rebound in consumption. The 
recent moderation in the inflation numbers too augurs well for the 
growth story, along with the pause in rate hike by the RBI in its 
April 2023 meeting.  
GLOBAL ENERGY SECTOR 
It has been a turbulent year for the global energy sector, marked 
by high geo-political uncertainty, redrawing of energy trade routes 
and high and volatile energy prices. In addition to immediate 
emergency measures to address the crisis, which meant looking 
for new suppliers and subsidies for consumers hit by high prices, 
the crisis also marked long term policy shifts in many cases. 
Energy security was clearly back in focus as a concomitant goal, 
along with energy transition, with the thrust on diversity of supplies 
and domestic production. The criticality of continued investments 
in oil and gas to ensure an orderly transition came to the fore.  
Nevertheless, the events of the year hastened the policy push 
towards energy transition and marked the beginning of a ‘great 
industrial scale-up’ in clean energy. In this regard, the International 
Energy Agency (IEA 2023) noted that major economies are acting 
to combine their climate, energy security and industrial policies 
into broader strategies for their economies, with most notable 
responses being the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), REPowerEU, 
and India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in green 
energy areas. 
Oil Market
After a sharp rise in the first half of 2022, global oil prices fell in the 
second half of 2022 and the downwards trajectory continued in the 
first quarter of 2023 as well. The workings of the global oil markets 
were complicated by a multiplicity of factors, which rendered the 
market to record price volatility, second only to levels observed 
during the 2008 financial crisis The supply concerns mired the 
market first, followed by high interest rates, fears of recession and 
China’s Covid-containment measures that pulled prices down 
later. Alongside this, historic draw-downs in government strategic 
oil inventories by the IEA members also helped ebb the surging 
market. In 2023, while reopening of the Chinese economy acted 
as a booster, the troubles in the global banking sector and the 
ensuing financial market stress weighed on the prices. 
Overall, both demand and supply grew in 2022. However, demand 
failed to recover to the pre-pandemic levels, trailing at 99.8 MBPD, 
1 MBPD below the 100.7 MBPD of 2019. On the supply side, bans 
and sanctions by the EU and its partners resulted in a seismic 
shift in oil trading routes and in Russia’s trade relations with the 
EU. Nevertheless, Russia’s oil production and exports remained 
resilient, as Russia continued to deliver its 10% share in global oil 
supply albeit the different buyers. OPEC+ raised its production by 
3 MBPD in 2022 but many OPEC+ member countries continue 
to produce below their targeted quotas, although the extent of 
shortfall has reduced in 2023. In the US, production increased 
modestly by 1 MBPD, despite high prices amidst investor pressure 
to maintain capital discipline.
Gas Market
The natural gas markets witnessed unprecedented turmoil in 2022. 
Europe’s efforts to meet its gas demand through LNG as its main 
alternative destabilized the global LNG market and trade, resulting 
in diversion of flows, soaring of spot LNG prices, and LNG demand 
destruction among Asian importers. Europe’s high dependence on 
piped natural gas imports from Russia pushed global gas markets 
into a crisis, with global gas prices hitting record high levels. 
Sanctions and counter-sanctions between the EU & Russia and 
later curtailment of gas flows to Europe left Europe scrambling for 
supplies following the soaring prices across markets. European 
gas prices (Dutch TTF) in late August hit record highs of over 
$90/mmbtu on continued uncertainty about Russian supplies and 
worries about meeting winter demand. With a robust build-up in 
European gas inventories (above the previous 5-year average), 
reduced natural gas consumption in Europe, milder winters and 
incoming LNG flows, natural gas prices fell across markets in the 
latter half of 2022 and well into 2023. 
Overall, global natural gas consumption fell by 2% in 2022, marking 
the fifth annual reduction since 1965. The decline was largely on 
account of reduction in European consumption, which was 8% 
below the 2015-2019 average. In 2022, LNG trade grew by 5%, 
demand in Europe rose by a striking 63% while in the Asia Pacific 
region LNG demand fell by 8% due to record high spot LNG 
prices. Russia’s piped gas exports to Europe in 2022 fell by 50%, 
the lowest since mid-1980s. While Russian natural gas production 
fell sharply, global natural gas supplies remained stable as supplies 
from elsewhere helped offset the decline. In particular, natural gas 
production in the US hit record levels in 2022, driven by high prices 
and high LNG export demand, which was serviced through new 
liquefaction capacity additions.
Upstream Investments
Structural underinvestment in hydrocarbons has been under way 
since the middle of the last decade in the context of low energy 
prices and rising investor focus on ESG (specifically carbon). 
Threats to energy security faced during the year brought the focus 
back on upstream investments, which hit an eight-year high and 
posted the largest year-on-year increase in history. According to 
the International Energy Forum (IEF) & S&P Global Commodities, 
upstream investment will need to rise even further to stave off a 
global oil supply shortfall this decade. A cumulative investment of 
US$ 4.9 trillion between 2023 and 2030 would be required to meet 
oil market needs, even if demand growth plateaued.
Low Carbon Energy
Global renewable energy capacity rose by 9.6% in 2022 (IRENA), of 
which solar and wind accounted for 90% of the net additions, and 
almost half of the new capacity was added in Asia. The additions 
lifted total renewable energy capacity to 3,372 gigawatts (GW) at 
the end of 2022, which was 295 GW higher than the previous year. 
Investment in clean energy hit a record US$ 1.7 trillion in 2022. 
According to the IEA, the ratio of clean energy to fossil energy 
investment which was 1:1 just five years ago has been rising, 
touching 1.7: 1 in 2022.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition
The events of the past year made it clear that a pragmatic focus 
on decarbonization and energy security would be crucial in 
sustaining the energy transition. Many mega policies and plans 
were launched such as the IRA (US 2022), REPowerEU (EU 2022), 
the Green Transformation (GX) programme (Japan, 2022), which 
not only focused on solar, wind and battery technologies but also 
on clean hydrogen, CCUS, nuclear and low emission gases in a 
big way. 
INDIAN ENERGY SECTOR
As the Indian economy normalized, emerging from the shadows 
of the pandemic, its energy demand surged, growing by 5.6%. 
The upsurge in economic and industrial activity lifted power 
consumption by 9.5% year-on-year in 2022-23, more than double 
the pace of the Asia Pacific region. India added over 15 GW of 
renewable energy capacity in 2022-23 (of which 12.8 GW was 
solar) taking the total of non-fossil power generation capacity to 
179 GW by the end of 2022-23.
The year was rocked by high and volatile energy prices, especially 
those of oil and gas. While consumers were protected from high 
oil prices to a large extent, in case of natural gas, LNG imports 
took a hit. Oil consumption grew by 10.2% year-on-year and also 
surpassed the pre-pandemic levels of 2019-20 by 8MMT. Natural 
gas consumption fell by 5.6% year-on-year and was at its lowest 
in the last five years. While domestic gas production at 33.7 BCM 
was the highest since 2014-15, LNG imports fell by 13%, the lowest 
since 2017-18 as LNG spot prices hit unprecedented highs.
The Government of India’s pragmatic stance on importing Russian 
oil not only helped India import Russian crude oil at competitive 
prices but also helped India diversify its crude oil sourcing. Russian 
oil imports to India increased manifold in 2022-23 compared to 
the previous years and in April 2023, Russian oil imports touched 
a record high, exceeding the combined flows from Saudi Arabia 
and Iraq. Russia is the third biggest oil producer in the world and 
prior to February 2022, 50% of crude oil exports from Russia were 
destined for Europe, while India was home to less than 2% of crude 
oil exports from Russia. By offering a market to Russian oil flows, 
India significantly contributed to the larger welfare as the world 
could ill-afford the loss of 10% of its oil supplies.
The year 2022-23 was marked with a considerable number of policy 
announcements that aimed to provide for building an affordable 
and sustainable energy security for the nation. In a landmark 
announcement, the Government launched the National Green 
Hydrogen Mission to make India the Global Hub for production, 
usage and export of Green Hydrogen and its derivatives. The 
Mission planned to build capabilities to produce at least 5 Million 
Metric Tonne (MMT) of Green Hydrogen per annum by 2030, 
with the potential to reach 10 MMT per annum with the growth of 
export markets. The year marked the launch of the country’s first 
green bonds. The proceeds from these bonds would be spent on 
a variety of renewable power projects, low emissions hydrogen, 
public transport, and afforestation. In a significant strategic call to 
prioritise energy security, India reduced the prohibited/no-go areas 
in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by 99%, thereby releasing 1 
Million sq. km for oil exploration and production. During the year, 
India initiated the process of establishing domestic regulations 
and procedures to operate a carbon market, with amendment 
of the Energy Conservation Act 2001 (Energy Conservation 
(Amendment) Act, 2022). 
Ethanol of blending in India increased from just 1.5% target 
from 2005-14 to 11.8% in the ethanol supply year 2022-23 (up to 
16.7.23). Decisive policy reforms and initiatives in the form of price 
assurance to farmers, opening up of alternate supply routes to 
address feedstock availability, and financial assistance schemes 
have helped bring about adequate increase in ethanol supply. 
The industry is geared up to meet the E20 target with more than 
adequate supplies of ethanol lined up, leaving room for pushing 
surplus ethanol for flex-fuel options.
Several landmark reforms in the gas sector were also announced 
during the year. The Government amended the regulations on 
unified tariff for natural gas pipelines transportation, which will 
boost the natural gas supply in faraway areas due to reduction 
in transportation cost. A new gas-pricing formula with floor and 
ceiling cap was introduced, which is expected to provide a stable 
pricing regime for domestic gas consumers, while at the same time 
providing adequate protection to producers from adverse market 
fluctuations with incentives for enhancing production. It is also likely 
to give an impetus to both PNG and CNG demand in the country.
LONG TERM ENERGY TRANSITION OUTLOOK
The energy sector globally and in India is witnessing a slow, yet 
profound shift towards low carbon energy forms. Today, majority of 
the countries have taken up Net-Zero Commitments, and India too 
made its historic announcement of reaching Net-Zero emissions 
by 2070 at COP 26. While a pervasive global phenomenon, energy 
transition pathways and the speed of transition will be unique for 
every country, depending on the context of their stage of economic 
development, demographics, resource base, among other factors. 
Over the long term, global energy demand is expected to remain 
almost unchanged at current levels, with energy demand estimated 
to have already peaked in the OECD countries. The declining share 
for all hydrocarbons, especially coal, rapid expansion in renewables 
in both absolute and relative terms, increasing electrification 
of final energy consumption, are seen as the vital three trends 
underpinning the long-term energy transition outlook globally. 
While the scale-up in renewables and increased electrification of 
final energy consumption are expected to be substantial across 
all scenarios, the scale of decline in share of hydrocarbons over 
the long term is seen to vary in a wide range across scenarios, 
especially for natural gas and oil, to some extent.

(2021-2050)*
India has set itself a target to achieve Net-Zero emissions by 
2070 and thereby reaffirmed India’s energy sector’s sustainability 
approach. Over the long term, India’s energy demand is expected 
to grow robustly at a median rate of 2.4% p.a. up to 2050. 
Megatrends underpinning this are an expanding economy, a rising 
population, urbanization, industrialization, an emerging middle 
class, and a young population in contrast to ageing societies of 
advanced economies. Moreover, in India there is also a pressing 
need to bridge the energy access deficit. Despite being the 
third largest energy consumer in the world, its per capita energy 
consumption levels continue to be strikingly low. At 0.6 toe (tonnes 
of oil equivalent) per person, India stands not only well below the 
world average of 1.8 toe per person, but also below the non-OECD 
average of 1.3 toe per person-pointing towards a conspicuous 
energy access deficit. On the supply front, India is currently highly 
dependent on imported energy supplies and this dependence is 
expected to rise, at least in the medium term. The recent energy 
crisis has brought energy security back into focus with the need 
for energy transition to be grounded in energy security. Ensuring 
‘energy access & affordability’ and ‘energy security’ are, therefore, 
the other two clear priorities for India. 
India's Energy Priorities
Energy Justice
"Ensuring energy justice while adhering to global commitments to sustainable growth":  
Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh. Narendra Modi
Energy Access 
& Affordability
Security Sustainability
Given this dynamic canvas where different variables and objectives 
play out, in the long-term India’s energy needs will have to be met 
through a holistic energy basket, where all energy forms co-exist. 
In India too, the share of renewables is set to rise, as is the share 
of modern bio-energy, in line with global trends and on account 
of policy support, as the Government works towards its Net-Zero 
2070 target. A series of decisive policy measures and initiatives 
have been announced/ rolled out by the Government over the last 
few years such as Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid 
&) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME II), Sustainable Alternative 
Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT,) Advancement of 
Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) 20%, the Green Hydrogen Mission, 
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, among others, which 
have invigorated investment in renewable energy, electric mobility, 
Green Hydrogen and bio-fuels sectors.

India's oil demand is set to grow robustly in this decade from around 5 MBPD currently to over 7 MBPD by 2030 and 
further may reach 9 MBPD by 2040, driven by rising per capita income, growing demand for personal vehicles, air travel, 
urbanization and shifting income pyramid
OPEC
In contrast to the accepted global prognosis of the declining share 
of hydrocarbons globally over the long term, in India, we would see 
energy transition progress on a different path. Wherein, the role of 
natural gas in India’s energy mix is set to enhance substantially and 
India sees natural gas to be crucial to its decarbonization strategy 
massive investments in the building of natural gas infrastructure 
are underway in the country. India’s oil demand is set to grow 
robustly in this decade from around 5 MBPD currently to over 7 
MBPD by 2030 and further may reach 9 MBPD by 2040, driven by 
rising per capita income, growing demand for personal vehicles, 
air travel, urbanization and shifting income pyramid.  Given the fact 
that India’s incremental demand will be the highest in the world 
between the period till 2040, the path to Energy transition will 
need to be calibrated and pragmatic to strike the balance between 
energy affordability, accessibility, security, and justice on one hand 
and the other addressing sustainability & climate change. While 
increasing penetration of EVs and alternatives may affect gasoline 
demand, oil demand in India would get substantial support from 
feedstock demand with growth in the petrochemicals segment.
On the domestic oil and gas supply front, India has a sedimentary 
basin cover of 3.4 Million square km and is appraised through 
geoscientific surveys to the extent of 61% of the total area. 
However, the exploration through drilling has penetrated less than 
10% of the area. Government of India has taken various measures 
to boost hydrocarbon production activities and raise crude oil 
production in India by revamping its hydrocarbon policy, launching 
of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP),  Discovered Small 
Fields (DSF) Bid Rounds, etc. Domestic crude oil production has 
been witnessing tapering in the last couple of years. Although, an 
upward swing to the tune of around 5MMT by 2024-25 is expected 
i.e. production is expected to rise to 34 MMT by the same period.  
As regards natural gas, domestic production has of late witnessed 
an upswing, with production in 2024-25 expected to be over 44 
BCM up from around 34 BCM in 2022-23.
INDIANOIL - AT THE CUSP OF ENERGY TRANSITION
IndianOil, as a leader in downstream oil business in India, views 
energy transition objectively and thoroughly understands its 
position in this regard.
The ongoing energy transition, in fact, presents a wide range of 
opportunities in high growth emerging energy areas and this, 
coupled with India’s vibrant and growing energy market, along with 
strong and pragmatic policy support, offers a robust opportunity 
for the Company. 
The Company has assiduously built its pan-India presence and 
is deeply connected to its extensive customer base. Its untiring 
services, even in the hour of crisis and calamities, have emboldened 
its brand image of being a reliable energy supplier. This  innate 
strength of the Company will continue to empower it, as it navigates 
through energy transition. In addition, its well proven ability in 
marshalling large-scale investments and expertise in operating 
world-scale installations, scaling-up operations swiftly and its 
track record in meeting stiff deadlines further fortify its confidence 
to effectively enter and grow in the new energy areas. Backed up 
with these, the Company envisages tapping new opportunities to 
emerge as a global, low cost, low carbon holistic energy solutions 
provider. These newer forays would not only provide it a growth 
platform but also help manage transition-related challenges of 
expected slowdown in growth of its core business over the long 
term. Nevertheless, realignment of its R&D and development and 
acquisition of newer talent as it enters new areas will be the priority 
as it navigates through the transition pathway.

OPPORTUNITIES & CHALLENGES
Continuous Improvement in Core Business to Maintain 
Leadership
The Company holds the leadership position in India’s downstream 
oil market. With India being the most prominent oil growth market, 
there is sizeable growth opportunity for the Company in this 
segment. 
Refineries
The recent energy crisis has brought to the fore the importance 
of energy security. Concerns and shortages in supply of refined 
petroleum products was one of the key fall-outs of the crisis, 
wherein product prices surged to unprecedented highs in global 
markets. 
IndianOil as the leading refined product supplier to the nation has 
been continuously  improving its refineries' capabilities to process 
a broader range of opportunity crudes and strategically diversifying 
its sources of supply. During the year, 36 new grades were added 
to the Company's crude basket, which now includes 247 grades 
from various regions such as Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, 
and Russia, among others. Further, over the long term, while India 
will continue to depend on imported crude oil supplies to meet 
its growing demand, having adequate domestic refining capacity 
would hold merit in strengthening India’s energy security.
India's energy demand is set to grow exponentially, driven by its 
rapid economic growth. The rising demand for road transport fuels 
further adds to this increasing trend. As the leading fuel refiner in 
the country, the Company is committed to ensuring Atmanirbharta 
as the country’s appetite for petroleum products grows in this 
decade and beyond. To meet this surge in demand, we are actively 
expanding our refining and distribution infrastructure across the 
country. The Company is augmenting the capacities of its existing 
refineries and with the ongoing expansions, the group refining 
capacity is set to increase from 80.55 MMTPA (including CPCL) to 
107.4MMTPA (including CPCL) by 2030.
IndianOil is currently executing significant brownfield expansion 
projects, with an estimated investment of over H 1 Lakh Crore 
which are integrated with petrochemicals expansion and aim 
at increasing Petrochemical Intensity Index (PII) to 15%. These 
projects encompass various developments, such as expanding the 
capacity of the Panipat Refinery from 15 to 25 MMTPA (H 34,627 
Crore), revamping the Gujarat Refinery to 18 MMTPA and integrating 
it with Lube and Petrochemical Production Units (H 18,936 Crore), 
and increasing the capacity of the Barauni Refinery from 6 to 9 
MMTPA (H 14,810 Crore), among others. Once completed, these 
projects will enhance our crude processing capacity by more than 
17 MMTPA. Furthermore, IndianOil's subsidiary CPCL is planning 
a 9 MMPTA (H 31,580 Crore) expansion in Tamil Nadu, contributing 
to a total capacity augmentation of over 26 MMTPA.
Given the ongoing consolidation in the global refining sector, these 
expansions offer significant value to IndianOil. Although global oil 
demand is not projected to reach its peak until 2030, the closure 
of refineries, particularly in Europe, is accelerating. This creates a 
scenario where demand continues to rise without a corresponding 
increase in supply. Consequently, the current decade is seen as 
the "golden age" for refiners and the Company is well-positioned 
with its plans to capitalize on this favourable situation. Besides, 
the recent tumultuous geopolitical events have shown how even 
the developed economies had to rearrange their energy baskets 
and lean back towards conventional fuels. The criticality of 
conventional fuels will be even more pronounced for a developing 
nation like India. The country’s energy demand is poised to grow 
three times faster than the rest of the world and will account for 
almost a quarter of the rise in global energy demand by 2040. 
While meeting the climate goals is a must, there is also a broad 
consensus in the global energy fraternity that oil & gas will continue 
to play an essential role in sustaining the growth of developing 
economies like ours, at least for the next couple of decades. So, 
the focus on conventional fuel forms like oil is essential to fulfilling 
the national priorities of energy accessibility, affordability, security 
and sustainability.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition
The ongoing energy transition would also entail changes in the 
refinery product demand patterns, with the importance of some 
products growing, while others facing a relative decline in their 
shares. In this regard, the Company’s refineries are equipped 
with the flexibility to have swing capabilities from one product to 
another. For instance, our refineries are fully equipped to reduce 
HSD production by 10% from the normal level and maximize ATF 
production. Further, increasing the utilization of Naphtha stream 
for new petrochemical projects would keep the light distillates 
intact as gasoline feels the pressure from growing EV penetration 
over the long term. Keeping the changing product slate in mind, 
many of our expansion projects are aimed at enhancing bitumen 
production capacity significantly. With the development of road 
infrastructure in the country getting a concerted push through the 
PM Gatishakti– National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity, 
the demand for bitumen is expected to receive a major fillip. In this 
context, sticking to the current production rate of bitumen would 
result in a deficit in the face of the growing demand, leading to an 
increase in imports. 
The Company stands fully committed to the principle of 
sustainability and aims to make its existing refinery operations and 
future expanded operations Net-Zero by 2046 and has adopted a 
multi-pronged approach to achieve the same by focusing on using 
low carbon/ renewable fuels such as natural gas, renewable power, 
CBG and green hydrogen along with the focus on increasing 
furnace and boiler efficiencies.
The R&D Division of the Company has over the years developed 
many indigenous refining technologies, which have been 
successfully adopted by its refineries, for instance  indeDiesel® 
(Diesel Hydrotreatment) Technology, indeHex® (Hexane 
Hydrogenation) Technology, INDAdeptG Technology for the 
production of low-sulfur gasoline, indJet® Technology for ATF 
production by selective removal of mercaptan sulphur, INDMAX 
Technology for converting heavy distillate and residue into LPG/
light distillate products and many more such technologies. Another 
area of opportunity in this regard is that of developing indigenous 
catalyst used in the refinery processes, which are invariably 
imported. The refineries are collaborating with R&D to develop in-
house catalysts, which can go a long way in improving profitability 
and reducing operating costs.
Pipelines 
The Company has a sprawling oil and gas pipelines network, 
which is more than 17,500 km in length. At present, the share of 
pipelines in the Company’s Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL) 
transportation stands at 64%. The low emissions profile of pipeline 
operations along with lower costs make pipelines the best fit in 
the context of sustainable operations and value creation. The 
Company plans to raise the share of pipelines in its modal mix 
to 80% by 2031-32, in line with what is currently seen in many 
developed economies. The Company is working on the expansion 
of its pipeline network, which includes projects lined up to link its 
11 Group refineries through pipelines to enhance the productivity 
of its refineries. In this regard, the Company’s New Mundra Panipat 
Crude Oil Pipeline is a transformative infrastructure project with a 
budget over H 9,000 Crore, aims to meet the increasing crude oil 
demand of the Panipat refinery upon its expansion to 25 MMTPA. 
The Company is making changes to its pipeline operations as it 
diversifies its fuel mix. Alongside oil pipelines, the Company now 
has an expanding network of natural gas pipelines. To comply 
with the GoI’s 20% ethanol-blending target, the Company has 
begun transporting ethanol-blended petrol through its product 
pipelines. Further, the Company is also working on feasible routes 
for introduction of hydrogen into its gas pipeline network. It is also 
collaborating with globally leading organizations for conversion of 
its existing natural gas pipelines for the transportation of hydrogen-
blended natural gas.
Pipelines also provide a unique opportunity to expand 
geographically beyond national boundaries and search for captive 
markets. In this regard, the Company has been guided by the 
Government of India’s 'Neighbourhood First Policy' . The Company 
has laid India’s first transnational oil pipeline, the Motihari- 
Amlekhganj (Nepal) POL pipeline, and is considering expansion 
of the same to Chitwan in Nepal. The Company will continue with 
the Neighbourhood First policy as we expand our presence in 
the Indian subcontinent. The Company is also looking into laying 
another POL pipeline from Siliguri to Jhapa in Nepal. The Company 
is exploring the expansion of its pipeline network in Bangladesh 
and Sri Lanka as well.
The R&D Centre continues to focus on making pipelines operation 
greener.  Recently, in an ‘Industry First’ initiative, a Drag Reducing 
Agent (DRA) trial by the Company’s R&D Centre was successfully 
carried out in an LPG pipeline, which will aid in reducing energy 
consumption as well as cost. 
To ensure that the pipelines are in perfect working conditions, the 
strict maintenance and surveillance schedules are paramount. The 
Company is increasingly leveraging state-of-the-art technologies 
such as Pipeline Intrusion Detection and Warning System (PIDWS) 
and drone patrolling to ensure enhanced monitoring. 
Marketing
The Company is the leader in India’s petroleum products market. 
The Indian market presents numerous growth opportunities, with 
projected growth rates being higher  than any other market. As the 
leading supplier in India’s high growth petroleum products market, 
the Company is confident in maintaining its leadership position 
through a range of interventions. In this pursuit, one major focus 
area is expansion of the marketing and distribution infrastructure, 
in line with growing demand, and tailoring these augmentations in 
the distribution network strategically to achieve cost efficiencies 
and be the ‘least costly’ supplier. 
IndianOil is developing Wayside Amenities (WSA), which is a 
new concept of Government of India and State Governments 
wherein one stop amenities for Fuel, Food, Toilets, Entertainment 
etc. are being developed along the highways. The Company has 
bagged total of 45 WSA sites, including 14 prestigious sites on 
Delhi -Mumbai access-controlled expressway. In addition to this, 
the Company has tied up with 49 NHAI sites with various WSA 
concessionaires to set up the fuel/gas stations. Presently, we 
are operating our fuel stations at 25 WSA sites and plan to bid 
aggressively for more such sites in the future.
The Company has been adapting to the evolving customer 
expectations by investing in modernization and automation of 
its retail outlets and loyalty-based offerings to deliver superior 
user experience and enhance brand loyalty. Digital initiatives 
are another important driver of customer experience in present 
times and the Company is bringing on board analytics-based 
queue management, mobile-based loyalty, contactless payments, 
hyperlocal marketing among many others. The Company has 
successfully launched its Integrated Transaction Processing 
Server (ITPS), a unified solution for receiving payments and 
awarding loyalty points to the valued customers at retail outlets. 
The ITPS boasts of having more than 12 Lakh transactions per 
day, expanding the scope from customer satisfaction to customer 
delight. 
Enhancement and differentiation of products and services is 
another imperative for the Company to maintain its leadership 
position. The focus is on offering sustainable and alternative 
fuels and targeting non-fuel revenue sources. Backed by efforts 
of its R&D Division, the Company has launched several high 
performance and environment-friendly fuels and products like XP-
95, XP-100, XtraGreen diesel, Green combo lubricants and ‘Chhotu’ 
(5 kg) and ‘Munna’ (2 kg) LPG cylinders in the last couple of years. 
These have received overwhelming response from customers. The 
expanse of high-performance petrol brand XP-95 Petrol has scaled 
up sizeably and it is being delivered in more than 9,700 retail 
outlets. The outreach of premium XP100 petrol almost doubled in a 
year to around 200 retail outlets. XtraGreen diesel, an environment-
friendly fuel that offers 5-7% fuel economy benefits and is amongst 
the cleanest diesel fuels globally available, is being delivered at 
more than 4,900 retail outlets of the Company across the country. 
IndianOil also scripted a new chapter in the Make in India saga 
by introducing AVGAS100 LL, in September 2022. Previously, 
pilot training schools and defence establishment in India relied 
on imports for this specialised aviation fuel. Moreover, during the 
year, we shipped a batch of AVGAS100 LL to Papua New Guinea, 
enabling the country to transition from being an importer to an 
exporter of this fuel.
The Company envisages transforming its 36,000 plus and growing 
retail network to complete energy solutions outlets. It is supplying 
E10 Petrol and has begun supplying E20 petrol at many of its retail 
outlets. At present, the Company is dispensing E20 petrol from 
close to 340 of its retail outlets and is rapidly extending E20 petrol 
availability across its network.  The Company is in full readiness to 
meet the stipulated timelines for the nationwide E20 Petrol roll-out. 
It is setting up LNG fuel stations along the Golden Quadrilateral and 
recently commissioned the first of these at Sriperumbudur, Tamil 
Nadu. With more than 5,400 EV charging stations at present, the 
Company plans to expand its reach to about a third of its network 
during 2023-24. Besides, it is also focusing on the novel battery-
swapping model with a steady rise of this facility at its retail outlets, 
which promises a quick turnover, given the huge base of two & 
three-wheelers in the country.
Beyond the domestic market, the Company has been catering to 
markets in the neighbourhood and has been establishing tie-ups. 
Over the long term, it plans captive overseas markets, and to enter 
newer geographies like Africa and South-east Asia and create 
Regional Hubs. 
Strengthening the Core Through Integration and 
Diversification
The vagaries of the energy markets, coupled with the uncertainty 
associated with the ongoing energy transition, make it imperative 
to not only make the core robust but also resilient. And, in this 
regard fortification of its core business through integration and 
diversification has been a key tenet of the Company’s growth 
strategy.
Research & Development
IndianOil R&D Centre is the hub of innovation and plays a 
key role in the Company’s efforts towards 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' 
(Self Reliance) by developing cost-effective, environmentally & 
socially responsible technology solutions, both in the core areas 
of expertise such as Lubricant, Refining, Petrochemicals and 
Pipeline and in the sunrise areas such as Solar Energy, Hydrogen, 
Energy Storage, Battery research, CCU Technologies, Bio-Energy 
& Nanotechnology to provide the Company with a Competitive 
edge and pave growth path for the future. 
The state-of-the-art R&D facilities located on a sprawling 65-
acre campus in Faridabad on the outskirts of the National Capital. 
An impressive array of most advanced equipment is available 
to experienced researchers and scientists round-the-clock. 
IndianOil’s R&D has filed 1,646 patents till March 31, 2023, out 
of which 1,554 are effective patents. IndianOil is the first Indian 
Oil & Gas company to cross the milestone of 1,500 patents filed 
which is the recognition of decades of pioneering work in field of 
lubricants formulation, refinery processes, pipeline transportation/ 
maintenance and alternative fuel technologies. IndianOil with 
its consistent efforts has also achieved the status of refining 
technology exporter by licensing the INDMAX technology to the 
Pancevo Refinery of Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) in Serbia.
To further expand its footprint and facilitate transformation to an 
integrated energy company, IndianOil is setting up the world’s 
largest net-zero (power & water) new campus at Faridabad with 
GRIHA-5 star rating, LEED platinum standards. The second 
campus, titled IndianOil Technology Development & Deployment 
Centre, is slated for commissioning in 2023-24. The R&D center 
is also driving IndianOil’s Start-up scheme and fostering a culture 
of innovation within and outside the organization. The latest 
innovation being the commercial launch of Surya Nutan Solar 
cooker which is a stationary, rechargeable, and always kitchen-
connected indoor cooking solution that collects energy from the 
sun and stores it in a scientifically proven thermal battery for use in 
cooking. Therefore, it is not dependent on grid electricity. 
Exploration & Production
In the context of highly volatile international oil and gas prices, 
integrating into the upstream business proves to be a valuable 
strategy for sustaining profitability. By combining upstream 
activities with refining operations, the Company aims to improve 
supply chain efficiency, diversify revenue streams, and maintain 
strategic control. Additionally, in the present geopolitical landscape, 
ensuring a secure supply of oil and gas has become increasingly 
crucial in addressing national energy security concerns.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition
The Company has, over the years, built a sizeable portfolio of 
E&P assets consisting of 18 domestic and 11 overseas blocks. The 
production from upstream assets increased to over 4 MMT of oil 
equivalent, which is 5% of the crude requirement of the refineries. 
The Company targets to increase its upstream integration ratio 
from 5% at present to 10% by 2030 (~11 MMT), primarily through 
investment in domestic assets, while also tapping suitable overseas 
opportunities, especially in producing oil & gas blocks.
Petrochemicals 
India's per capita polymer consumption currently stands at 12 kg, 
which is significantly lower than that of China (82 kg) and the 
US (93 kg). This disparity presents a substantial opportunity for 
expansion and scaling within the sector, that will expand further 
with the rising GDP.
The petrochemicals are known to have strong synergies with the 
core refining business and this has significantly contributed to 
the bottom-line of the Company.  In the context of the ongoing 
energy transition, the significance of integrating downstream into 
petrochemicals becomes even more pronounced. By integrating 
into petrochemicals, the Company plans to effectively capture 
both volume and value growth opportunities, while also optimizing 
refinery utilization during periods of reduced fuel demand. This 
strategic integration enables a comprehensive approach to 
leverage the potential benefits of the petrochemical sector in terms 
of growth and overall refinery performance.
The Company, therefore, is clear that all refinery expansions 
will have petrochemical integration as an integral part with the 
dual objective of value addition and risk mitigation. As a long-
term strategy, we aim to enhance the Company's Petrochemical 
Intensity Index (PII) to 15% by 2030 from almost 5% currently. 
This will de-risk the refinery operations and boost the bottom-
line. The Company’s petrochemicals strategy is primarily based 
on utilization of captive feedstock and will be bolstered by 
investments in specialty chemicals and entry into emerging areas 
of compounding.
In March 2023,  in a momentous leap, IndianOil’s Board has 
accorded 'Stage-I' approval for setting up a Petrochemical Complex 
at Paradip, Odisha, at an estimated cost of over H 61,000 Crore. This 
mega project will be the largest-ever investment of IndianOil at a 
single location and shall significantly improve the Petrochemical 
Intensity Index of the company. It shall be a growth driver in 
making the Company a major player in the Petrochemical industry 
while strengthening India's self-reliance in the petrochemical 
sector. The Project is a mega-scale investment by IndianOil in 
the state of Odisha and will generate huge economic and social 
benefits for the country in general and Odisha state, in particular. 
More importantly, this mega project is aligned with Hon'ble Prime 
Minister’s vision of Purvodaya, which aims to accelerate the 
development trajectory and socio-economic prosperity in Eastern 
India.  As a major milestone, 2200 acres of land for the project have 
already been approved by the Government of Odisha out of which 
800 acres has already been notified. The project will generate a 
multiplier effect for the local economy, and the extensive incentives 
package from the Government of Odisha for this project will go 
a long way in strengthening this symbiotic relationship.  This 
mega-project, along with other significant ones on the anvil like 
the Panipat Naphtha Cracker Phase II expansion, Styrene Unit at 
Panipat and PVC Project at Gujarat Refinery will be a significant 
leap in IndianOil's journey of excellence. 
Bio-fuel Integration 
The global trend of incorporating bio-fuels into refineries is gaining 
momentum and is gaining impetus from policy interventions such 
as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA). At home, the amendments to the National 
Policy on Bio-fuels-2018 have given an impetus to a wide range 
of alternate feedstock for use in ethanol and bio-diesel production. 
The Company is already blending bio-fuels at its refineries and is 
supplying E10 Petrol across its network and also supplying E20 
Petrol at increasingly many outlets.  The refinery feed globally is 
expected to get diversified to include bio-based feedstocks, to 
produce renewable fuels, known for their low carbon footprint 
and can serve as domestic resources that can be seamlessly 
integrated into refinery operations. In India, there is policy support 
for bio-fuels, presenting a unique opportunity for the Company to 
establish its refineries as centres for advanced bio-fuel generation 
such as 2G, 3G ethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
The Company has set up Asia’s first 2G Ethanol Plant based on 
Paddy straw feedstock at Panipat having 3 Crore litres per annum 
capacity. It would use 2,20,000 MT / annum of feedstock and lead 
to reduction of ~3 Lakh tonnes of GHG emission (equivalent to 
replacing over 63,000 cars annually from roads of country). The 
plant was dedicated to the nation on August 10, 2022 by the Prime 
Minister of India.  
In another first, IndianOil has set up World’s first Refinery off gas to 
ethanol (3G ethanol) producing plant of 4.2 Crore litres per annum 
capacity at Panipat. IndianOil is the first Oil Refining Company in 
the world which has adopted this technology. This would lead to 
mitigation of ~1.8 Lakh tonnes of GHG emission / annum. 
Additionally, the Company it is collaborating with global technology 
leaders like LanzaJet, and Praj for setting up Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
(SAF) plants. IndianOil plans to set up an 86.8 TMTPA capacity SAF 
Plant at Panipat, based on LanzaJet Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) Technology. 
The Plant will use 3G Ethanol as feedstock providing additional 
carbon benefits. IndianOil has also signed an MoU with Praj to set 
up a 10 TPD capacity SAF demo plant in Pune and progressively 
scale it up to a 500 TPD capacity commercial plant by 2035.
Natural Gas
Increasing the share of gas in the energy mix is crucial to the 
decarbonisation of the Indian economy. The government of India 
plans to increase Natural Gas share in India’s primary energy from 
6.5% to 15%. A supportive policy environment and bold reforms 
have invigorated investment in this sector. In India, natural gas 
demand is expected to grow robustly on account of policy impetus, 
coupled with rising domestic production and LNG imports. 
The Corporation is invested across the natural gas value chain in 
the country and envisages an enhanced role in India’s growing 
gas economy. It is a major player in the LNG business in India, 
accounting for 20% share in the RLNG market in the country. The 
Company targets a leadership position in the RLNG market with 
28% share by increasing its sales from around 4.5 MMT at present 
to 20 MMT by 2030 through massive scale-up in infrastructure with 
the help of ongoing and planned investments. In line with this, the 
Company aims to expand its gas infrastructure and strengthen its 
supply chain by putting up new LNG terminals and gas pipelines. 
The participation in development of new infrastructure has been 
planned through multiple routes viz. booking of capacities in the 
upcoming LNG terminals, setting up of LNG terminals and laying 
of gas pipelines by the Company itself or through the JVC route 
in addition to building CGD networks. The Company is looking at 
expanding its Ennore terminal from 5 to 10 MMTPA and has also 
booked capacity in the Jafrabad and the Dhamra terminals. It has 
been aggressively expanding its CGD network, both through its 
JV companies and on a standalone basis. During the 9 th, 10 th & 
11th  PNGRB bidding rounds, IndianOil on standalone basis bagged 
26 Gas. At present, the Company along with its 2 JV Companies, 
is present in 49 GAs and 105 Districts spread across 21 States 
and UTs, making it one of the major CGD players in the country, 
reaching 20.6% of Population, covering 12.3% of area and meeting 
15.2% of total CGD demand of the country. 
Alongside, to ensure affordable supplies and insulate from price 
shocks, during the year, the Company continued to be in touch 
with various LNG suppliers for securing long term LNG through 
new contracts and renewal of existing contracts. In this respect 
Company has established long term LNG supply of around 2 
MMTPA combined from ADNOC & TotalEnergies. These efforts 
for securing long term supply shall further strengthen IndianOil’s 
vision to be the ‘Energy of India’ and align to Government’s vision 
to increase the share of gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030. 
The Company’s endeavours continue to secure opportunities in 
domestic gas auctions that keep coming from time to time and 
its access to domestic gas is getting enhanced. Recently, the 
Company successfully bid tenders for procurement of domestic 
gas, with a combined volume of over 5 MMSCMD.
Transformation to a Holistic Energy Solutions Provider
The Company is constantly on the quest to provide energy solutions 
to the nation through new, sustainable, and smarter ways to meet 
the energy transition challenges. On a standalone basis, the 
Company, along with its JVs and subsidiaries, is already operating 
in new energy areas. It is also forging synergistic alliances with 
other players to meet its growth targets. In line with India’s Vision 
to be Net-Zero by 2070, the Company has laid out its Net-Zero 
plans as well, aiming to achieve it by 2046 (Scope 1 & Scope 2 
emissions).
The Company recently announced its intention to pursue green 
initiatives at an altogether different scale and as a first step 
envisages the consolidation of all its existing green assets under 
one entity. It has set ambitious targets for its green portfolio for 
2030 & 2050. The Company intends to expand its green portfolio 
beyond its own 2046 target requirement, with a much larger role 
in contributing to the nation’s Net-Zero 2070 target. 
From accounting for 9% of India’s energy basket today, the 
Company plans a massive scale-up, aiming to account for a 1/8 th 
share in the Indian energy basket by 2050.
In terms of components of the Company’s 2050 portfolio, it sees a 
reduction in the share of oil to 46.3% from 92% at present and an 
enlarged share of natural gas at 27.4% from 8% currently. It is also 
looking at an enhanced share of renewables/clean energy solutions 
to 26.3%. The Company is not only transforming its energy basket 
from being oil-centric to a more holistic and diversified one but is 
also emboldening its role as India’s prime energy supplier.  
Expanding Renewable Portfolio 
The Company plans to build a renewable portfolio of of 31 GW 
by 2030 and 200 GW by 2050. To expand this energy portfolio, 
the Company is collaborating with other public and private energy 
companies working in the space of clean energy technologies. In 
this regard it has formed a JV with NTPC Green Energy Limited, is 
exploring opportunities with respect to the potential collaboration 
through JV (50:50) with SJVN (Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam) Limited. 
The Company is also considering to spin off a  new Wholly Owned 
Subsidiary (WoS), through which it will consolidate its green 
assets. Further to these initiatives, IndianOil has approached  states 
of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh  for 
setting up GW scale RE projects and initial discussions have been 
initiated  with Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka. 
Compressed Bio-gas (CBG)
CBG is produced from organic waste and is an alternative to 
compressed natural gas (CNG). The overall lifecycle of greenhouse 
gas savings of bio-methane, compared to natural gas, is typically 
high - at 80 to 85%. Given its merits, CBG is going to be an 
important component of the Company’s green portfolio and is also 
likely to help in greening its operations as it works towards its Net-
Zero 2046 target. 
The Company has constructed a cattle dung-based CBG plant at 
Hingonia Cattle Rehabilitation Centre (HCRC) of Jaipur, another 
plant in Gorakhpur based on mixed waste agri-corp residue has 
also been completed and another is being set up in Gwalior 
and  is exploring setting up of 30 CBG Plants across India. The 
Government of Uttar Pradesh has introduced the Uttar Pradesh 
State Bio-Energy Policy-2022 providing various enablers and 
facilitation for setting up CBG Plants in the State. IndianOil is 
planning to set up of 14 CBG plants in Uttar Pradesh with total 
capacity for processing of about 700 TMTPA of biomass & waste 
for producing about 50 TMTPA CBG.

Hydrogen
The National Green Hydrogen Mission, approved recently by the 
Government, envisages making India a leading producer and 
supplier of Green Hydrogen in the world and creating export 
opportunities for Green Hydrogen and its derivatives by including 
a slew of incentives. 
In line with the Government’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, 
the Company is pursuing plans for hydrogen production across 
various hues, including utilizing renewable power to generate green 
hydrogen at its locations. IndianOil plans to set up 10 KTA (~ 85 
MW) of Green Hydrogen plant at Panipat. IndianOil’s Board has 
approved the formation of joint ventures with ReNew and L&T to 
develop (including construction) green hydrogen production assets 
and associated renewable assets. Another JV with L&T has been 
approved, which will manufacture and sell electrolyzers. Additionally, 
the Company’s R&D is working in the different areas of the hydrogen 
value chain such as bio-methane to hydrogen, bio-mass gasification 
to hydrogen, and electrolyzer technologies and fuel cells.
EV Charging and Battery Technology
The transition to electric vehicles is a promising global strategy 
for decarbonizing the transport sector. The EV market in India is 
expected to grow at a CAGR of 44% and is expected to hit 6.34 
Million units of annual sales by 2027. The Company is crafting an 
ambitious blueprint in the electric mobility arena. 
In addition to setting up charging stations and pushing for the 
battery-swapping model, the Company, through its JV IOC 
Phinergy Private Limited (IOP), is working on the niche Aluminium-
Air battery technology. This has the potential to provide a viable 
and affordable e-mobility solution, based on domestically available 
and abundant raw material (aluminium). The technology has been 
successfully demonstrated in India as an energy back-up solution 
at the telecom sites of a leading Indian telecom tower operator. 
Currently, IOP is collaborating with leading automobile OEMs and 
aluminium suppliers for the development of logistics infrastructure. 
IOP has plans to commercialize the Al-Air battery technology in 
India, which includes manufacturing of the battery in India and 
setting up of the logistics infrastructure. 
For propagating green mobility, IndianOil Board has recently 
approved the formation of a joint venture company for battery 
swapping business in India as a Private Limited Company with a 
50:50 collaboration between IndianOil and Sun Mobility Pte. Ltd. 
Singapore (SMS). Sun Mobility is a global leader in providing energy 
infrastructure and services to the transportation sector enabling 
electric vehicles to be charged in a faster, cheaper, and more 
convenient way; thereby, making mass migration to a sustainable, 
pollution-free future possible. IndianOil would be infusing equity 
in the JV to the tune of H 1,800 Crore till the financial year 2026-
27. The Board has also accorded approval for an investment of 
H 640 Crore in IOCL Singapore Pte. Ltd. Singapore (a Wholly 
Owned Subsidiary of IndianOil) for the acquisition of Preference 
Shares and Warrants of Sun Mobility Pte. Ltd. Singapore.
Availability of adequate charging infrastructure is a pre-requisite 
for growth in the EV penetration.  The Company has been the 
leading Oil Marketing Companies in terms of installation of EV 
charging infrastructure with close to 5500 charging stations and 
targets increasing this to 10,000 in near future. Battery swapping 
model  holds high potential in developing country markets like 
India with large and growing electric two-wheeler and  three-
wheeler populations, the Company here again leads the industry 
with 76 battery swapping stations already under its folds.  
Other  Businesses
The Company is exploring opportunities outside energy business 
areas too. Diversification is a risk-reduction strategy to help expand 
into new markets and industries and achieve greater profitability.
Cryogenics 
Envisaged growth in the share of natural gas from the present 
6.5% in the primary energy mix to 15%, offers a huge potential 
for growth in LNG, which uses cryogenics-based transportation. 
Furthermore, cryogenics is expected to play a crucial role in 
supporting varied applications of hydrogen since the liquefaction of 
hydrogen for storage requires sub-zero temperatures. The energy 
transition is, therefore, expected to be a spur for cryogenic vessels 
and cylinders. Cryogenics is amongst the sunrise industries of the 
ongoing energy transition. 
The Company has a small but significant cryogenics portfolio, 
which it plans to nurture to seize the growth opportunities in the 
area. The Cryogenics group of the Company is a pioneer in its field, 
having over 40 years of experience in the design and production 
of state-of-the-art vacuum super-insulated Cryogenic Storage 
& Transport Vessels. IndianOil has been supplying LNG through 
Cryogenic Road Tankers since 2007. 
Anticipating high growth potential in the Cryogenic segment, 
especially in LNG, Liquid Oxygen & Liquid Nitrogen, the Company 
is setting up a new Cryogenics manufacturing facility at Nasik. 
Spread over an area of around 50 Acres the new state of the art 
facility will emerge as a major player offering a wide range of 
product and customised solutions in Cryogenics. With this new 
facility, installed capacity of Cryogenic vessels would be enhanced 
from  35 vessels per annum to 480 Nos per annum with production 
range extending up to 250 KL from existing 127 KL.  Further to this,  
LNG fuel tanks, Liquid cylinders & Microbulk systems, ISO tanks 
and Dispensing systems would be added to the product portfolio.
Explosives
The Company's Explosives group has been actively pursuing 
business opportunities in the Industrial Explosives business in 
India. At present coal mining sector is the main customer for its 
explosives business. There is a preponderance of coal in India’s 
energy mix and with the growing energy demand of the country, 
the coal sector is expected to continue playing a major role in the 
future as well. 
The Company's first bulk explosives plant of 30 KTA capacity in 
western India was commissioned in Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) 
at Umrer, near Nagpur. Another Bulk explosive plant at Basundhara 
(Odisha) has been constructed and is ready for commissioning. 
IndianOil would be setting up a 30 KTA Bulk Explosives Plant at the 
Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) premises at Mandamarri 
(Telangana). Also, a long-term Contract has been executed with 
Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Ltd. (NLCIL), Neyveli, Tamil 
Nadu. With this, the Company will be able to expand its footprint 
for the first time in the bulk explosives business in southern India. 
The Company holds a leadership position in the bulk explosives 
business in the country and is actively scaling up its presence, the 
Company also envisages entry into the packed explosives, a high-
growth segment, through suitable collaborations.
Innovative Financing Solutions
The company has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary IOC 
Global Capital Management IFSC Limited (IGCMIL) in International 
Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at Gujarat International Finance 
Tec-City (GIFT City), Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Area. This 
company shall operate as a Finance Company predominantly in 
the areas of Global Treasury Centre, Trade Financing and Global 
Financing. It shall undertake financial services primarily in respect 
of IOCL Group companies that are currently carried out outside 
India by overseas financial institutions and overseas branches/ 
subsidiaries of Indian financial institutions. It shall also be providing 
platform to carry out operations of our foreign companies as well 
as future inbound and outbound investments of Indian Oil. New 
innovative business structures shall be created through IGCMIL 
to source funds and provide a better and efficient investment 
structure in place for fuelling the growth of group companies.
RISKS & CONCERNS
Organizations across the board are facing an exceptionally 
challenging risk landscape due to a series of disruptions, which 
began with the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict triggered a fresh wave of crisis, disrupting commodity 
markets. This, in turn, led to a host of problems like surging global 
inflation, trade wars, capital outflows from emerging markets, 
energy security breaches, and social unrest in many parts of the 
world. Alongside, the rising global temperatures and the global push 
towards Net-Zero have added to the complexity of the situation. 
The crisis of 2022 brought back energy security into focus. IndianOil 
as the flagship energy supplier to the country understands its 
responsibility of ensuring energy security, for which the Company 
is committed to enhancing the ability of its refineries to process 
a wider array of opportunity crudes and strategically diversifying 
its supply sources. In 2022-23, 36 new grades were included in 
the Company’s crude basket and now the crude basket contains 
247 grades from different regions like Africa, the Middle East, the 
Americas, and Russia etc. 
The Company is committed to effectively managing the risk matrix 
it faces with ever-growing resilience and proactiveness. The major 
risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically 
addressed through mitigating action plans on a continuous basis. 
Risks are assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down 
and bottoms-up approach, covering the enterprise, the business 
units, the functions, the market share and projects. 
The risks identified by the Company inter-alia include:
 Economic risks arising from international crude oil and 
products market fluctuations;
 Financial risks such as foreign exchange rate fluctuations, 
exposure to borrowings;
 Competition risks arising from competitors within the existing 
businesses and from new businesses such as alternative 
energy sources, electric mobility;
 Operational risks such as pilferages, labour unrest, unplanned 
shutdown of refineries;
 Security and fraud risks, including cyber-security, data 
leakage and physical security risks;
 Reputational risks such as brand value risk;
 Environmental risk arising from the impact on the environment 
from our business activities and increase in compliance cost 
in view of the emerging regulations;
 Compliance risks arising from tax disputes and litigation; and
 The risk of change in Government policies impacting 
profitability and ability to do business
 The energy transition offers opportunities but also comes with 
inherent risks, notably the potential for a disorderly transition. 
Such disorderliness can lead to insufficient future supplies, 
causing extreme price fluctuations and supply disruptions.
In addition to these, with ESG scrutiny on the rise, globally and in 
India, the Company has broadened its coverage of identified risks 
to include Environmental Impact in terms of the GHG emissions 
impact (SCOPE 1 & 2) and the water footprint.
FINANCIAL REVIEW

Standalone Financial Performance 
In 2022-23, the Revenue from Operations experienced a remarkable 
growth of more than 28%, reaching H 9,34,953 Crore from H 7,28,445 
Crore in the previous year. The combination of higher prices and 
a greater sales volume contributed to the substantial growth in 
revenue during the year. 
In 2022-23, the Company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, 
Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) margin was at 3.05%, the 
Operating Profit margin was at 1.11%, and the Net Profit margin 
was at 0.88%. These figures show a decrease compared to the 
previous year in which the EBITDA margin was at 6.53%, the 
Operating Profit margin was at 4.42%, and the Net Profit margin 
was at 3.32%. 
The Net Profit for 2022-23 was H 8,242 Crore compared to 
H 24,184 Crore last year. The decrease in EBITDA, Operating Profit 
and Net Profit margin is mainly on account of lower marketing & 
petrochemicals margins and higher exchange losses during the 
year  compared to last year. Due to lower profitability and increase 
in borrowings in comparison to the previous year, the Company's 
return on average capital employed experienced a decline from 
15.44% to 6.19%. However, its efficiency to deploy its assets to 
produce the revenue improved from 2.03 times to 2.33 times as 
Revenue from Operations significantly increased in the year.
At the beginning of the year, crude prices were already at a higher 
level of about US$ 103/bbl, which went further up to US$ 122/bbl in 
June 2022 before softening and closing at about US$ 78/bbl. The 
average HSD crack spread increased significantly from US$ 10/bbl 
in the previous year to US$ 35/bbl during the year with high volatility 
and the crack touched a high of US$ 65/bbl in June 2022. Similarly, 
the average MS crack spread, which was about US$ 11/bbl in the 
previous year, improved to US$ 14/bbl during the year and touched 
a high of US$ 40/bbl in June 2022. The quarter-wise movement in 
refining margins (in $/bbl) is shown in the chart below:

The Singapore benchmark for refining margins improved during 
the year on account of the higher spread between international 
prices of petroleum products and crude. As can be seen from above 
chart, the Company’s normalised refining margin (i.e. normalized 
GRM) during the year moved in tandem with the international 
margins. Normalised GRM of the Company increased from US$ 
7.61/bbl in 2021-22 to US$ 20.14/bbl in 2022-23 compared to the 
increase in the Singapore GRM from US$ 4.99/bbl to US$ 10.77/
bbl. The inventory holding by the Company was high on account 
of inland refineries, due to which inventory gain/loss becomes 
significant during a fluctuating price scenario and hence, greater 
volatility was seen in reported margins.
The Current Ratio of the Company remained at the same level 
as the previous year, indicating a consistent balance between 
current assets and liabilities. Increase in borrowings led to a rise 
in the Company's Debt-to-Equity ratio from 0.84 times to 0.98 
times. On account of lower marketing & petrochemical margins, 
higher exchange losses and increased finance cost compared to 
the previous year, profit for the current year reduced significantly, 
resulting in the deterioration of Interest Coverage Ratio from 
8.25 times to 3.39 times. The debt service coverage ratio also 
experienced a significant decrease, dropping from 5.10 times to 
1.30 times, primarily because of higher principal repayment of 
long-term borrowings and a lower profit for the year.
The inventory-holding period was about 43 days and Company’s 
average collection period was 6 days. Both the Return on Equity 
(ROE) & the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) were lower in 
the year. The ROE fell from 20.00% to 6.20%, while the ROCE 
decreased from 15.44% to 6.19%. The variation was primarily on 
account of the reduction in profitability due to suppressed margins 
and significant exchange losses in comparison to the previous 
year. Higher dividend receipt during the year turned out to be a key 
reason for increase in the Return on Investment (ROI) from 4.69% 
to 9.18%. The Company paid a final dividend of H 3,305 Crore for the 
financial year 2021-22 during 2022-23. The Company's earnings 
per share (EPS) for the year 2022-23 stood at H 5.98, but no interim 
dividend was declared during the year. However, the Board of 
Directors recommended a final dividend of H 3.00 per equity share 
(face value: H 10/- per equity share) for 2022-23, subject to approval 
by the members of the Company in the Annual General Meeting. 
Detailed financial indicators and ratios for the last five years are 
provided in the section ‘Performance at a Glance’ forming a part of 
the Annual Report.
Group Financial Performance 
The Group's Revenue from Operations for the year amounted 
to H 9,51,410 Crore, depicting a significant increase compared to 
H 7,36,716 Crore in the previous year. However, the Net Profit for 
the current year stood at H 9,792 Crore, reflecting a decline from 
H 25,102 Crore in the previous year mainly on account of factors 
which impacted the standalone performance of the Company. 
A detailed breakdown of the profit from standalone to group is 
provided in Note 46 of Consolidated Financial Statements.
The financial performance of the material subsidiaries, Joint 
Ventures and Associates is provided in Note 33A and 33B of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year Chennai 
Petroleum Corporation Limited, a subsidiary reported a profit of 
H 3,531.53 Crore and a Total Comprehensive Income of H 3,518.13 
Crore. Another subsidiary, Lanka IOCL PLC reported a profit of Sri 
Lankan Rupee 376.95 Crore and a Total Comprehensive Income 
of Sri Lankan Rupee 381.44 Crore which, after adjustments as 
per IndAS, translates to a profit of H 856.60 Crore and a Total 
Comprehensive Income of H 928.08 Crore. Under Joint Ventures & 
Associates, Petronet LNG Limited achieved a profit of H 3,325.82 
Crore and a Total Comprehensive Income of H 3,321.46 Crore and 
IndianOil Petronas Private Limited recorded a profit of H 249.25 
Crore and a Total Comprehensive Income of H 249.04 Crore.

Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the 
carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. 
These include the decision to capitalise or expense costs; the 
annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalisation 
of assets and the use of management assumptions and 
estimates for the determination or the measurement and 
recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due 
to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of 
the Company and the level of judgement and estimates 
required, we consider this to be as area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the 
appropriateness of capitalisation process, performed tests of details on 
costs capitalised, the timeliness of the capitalisation of the assets and the 
de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use.
In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made 
by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalised; 
determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the 
appropriateness of assets lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/
amortisation; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment 
of the management. We observed that the management has regularly 
reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (“the Company”), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including 
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the 
year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division 
situated at Faridabad, Haryana, India.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements 
give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity 
with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, 
and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year 
ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and "the Rules" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters 
described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:

Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Financial Performance highlights, Board’s Report including Annexure to Board’s Report, Management 
Discussions and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Report on Corporate Governance, Shareholders Information 
and other information in the Integrated Annual Report but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above 
when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of auditors’ report, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the remaining other information, which we will obtain after the date of auditors’ report and if we conclude that there is 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these 
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such 
controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Provision for Direct Taxes
The Company has uncertain direct tax positions including 
matters under dispute which involves significant judgment 
relating to the possible outcome of these disputes in 
estimation of the provision for income tax. Because of the 
judgement required, this area is considered as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures involved assessment of the management’s underlying 
assumptions in estimating the tax provision and the possible outcome of 
the disputes taking into account the legal precedence, jurisprudence and 
other rulings in evaluating management’s position on these uncertain 
direct tax positions. We have also assessed the disclosures made by the 
company in this regard in standalone financial statements
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
The Company is involved in various taxes and other 
disputes for which final outcome cannot be easily predicted 
and which could potentially result in significant liabilities. 
The assessment of the risks associated with the litigations 
is based on complex assumptions, which require the use 
of judgement and such judgement relates, primarily, to the 
assessment of the uncertainties connected to the prediction 
of the outcome of the proceedings and to the adequacy 
of the disclosures in the standalone financial statements. 
Because of the judgement required, the materiality of such 
litigations and the complexity of the assessment process, 
this area is considered as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures in response to this Key Audit Matter included, 
among others,
• Assessment of the process and relevant controls implemented 
to identify legal and tax litigations and pending administrative 
proceedings.
• Assessment of assumptions used in the evaluation of potential 
legal and tax risks performed by the legal and tax department of 
the Company considering the legal precedence and other rulings in 
similar cases.
• Inquiry with the legal and tax departments regarding the status of 
the most significant disputes and inspection of the key relevant 
documentation.
• Analysis of opinion received from the experts wherever available.
• Review of the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the 
standalone financial statements.
Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and 
Associates
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
which are valued at cost have been adjusted for impairment 
losses in line with “Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets” . In case 
there is an indication of possible impairment, the Company 
carries out an impairment test by comparing the recoverable 
amount of the investments determined according to 
the value in use method and their carrying amount. The 
valuation process adopted by management is complex and 
is based on a series of assumptions, such as the forecast 
cash flows, the appropriate discounting rate and the growth 
rate. These assumptions are, by nature, influenced by future 
expectations regarding the evolution of external market.
Since judgement of the management is required to determine 
whether there is indication of possible impairment and 
considering the subjectivity of the estimates relating to the 
determination of the cash flows and the key assumptions of 
the impairment test, the area is considered as a key audit 
matter.
With reference to this key audit matter, we considered the following:
• Book value of the investments in subsidiaries, joint venture and 
associates as compared to the carrying amount.
• Market capitalization in case of listed entities in which investments 
have been made.
• Some of the entities are still in the construction stage and have not 
begun commercial operations.
Based on the information and explanations obtained as above, we 
concluded that the Management’s judgement regarding indication of 
impairment in certain investments during the year is appropriate. Where 
there is indication of impairment, we examined the approach taken by 
management to determine the value of the investments, analysed the 
methods and assumptions applied by management to carry out the 
impairment test and the reports obtained from the experts in valuation.
The following audit procedures were adopted:
• identification and understanding of the significant controls 
implemented by the Company over the impairment testing process; 
analysis of the reasonableness of the principal assumptions made 
to estimate their cash flows, and obtaining other information from 
management that we deemed to be significant;
• analysis of actual data of the year and previous years in comparison 
with the original plan, in order to assess the nature of variances and 
the reliability of the planning process;
• assessment of the reasonableness of the discount rate and growth 
rate;
• Verification of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to 
determine the value in use of the investments.
We also examined the adequacy of the information provided by the 
Company about the impairment test and its consistency with the 
requirements of Ind AS 36.

obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our

the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/financial information of the branch to express an 
opinion on the standalone financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of 
the financial statements of the components which have been audited by us. For the branches included in the standalone financial 
statements, which have been audited by branch auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
We did not audit the financial statements of one Branch included in the standalone financial statements of the Company whose financial 
statements reflect total assets of H 1,752.93 crore as at March 31, 2023 and total revenues of H 39.24 crore for the year ended on that date, 
as considered in the standalone financial statements. The financial statements of this Branch have been audited by the Branch Auditor 
whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this 
Branch, is based solely on the report of such Branch Auditors.
The standalone financial statements include the Company’s proportionate share (relating to Jointly controlled operations of E&P activities) 
in assets H 764.51 crore and liabilities H 171.49 crore as at March 31, 2023 and total revenue of H 274.07 crore and profit before tax of  
H 170.50 crore for the year ended on that date and in items of the statement of cash flow and related disclosures contained in the enclosed 
standalone financial statements. Our observations thereon are based on unaudited statements from the operators to the extent available 
with the Company in respect of 24 Blocks (out of which 12 Blocks are relinquished) and have been certified by the management. Our 
opinion in respect thereof is solely based on the management certified information. According to the information and explanations given 
to us by the Company’s management, these are not material to the Company.
We have also placed reliance on technical/ commercial evaluations by the management in respect of categorization of wells as exploratory, 
development and dry well, allocation of cost incurred on them, liability under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and nominated 
blocks for under-performance against agreed Minimum Work Programme.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are 
subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements in place and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as 
at March 31, 2023 based on the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting issued by the ICAI.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid report under section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls 
with reference to standalone financial statements in so far as it relates to one Branch audited by the Branch Auditors, is based on the 
corresponding report of the Branch Auditors.
Annexure C to the Independent Auditors’ Report
Annexure referred to in Independent Auditors’ report of even date to the members of Indian Oil Corporation 
Limited on the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (“the 
Company”) as of March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended 
on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s 
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls with reference to 
standalone financial statement and both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone 
financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial 
statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition Notes to Financial Statements 
NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.2.2 Borrowing cost incurred during construction period on loans 
specifically borrowed and utilized for projects is capitalized 
on quarterly basis up to the date of capitalization.
2.2.3 Borrowing cost, if any, incurred on General Borrowings used 
for projects is capitalized at the weighted average cost. The 
amount of such borrowings is determined on quarterly 
basis after setting off the amount of internal accruals.
B. Capital Stores
2.2.4 Capital Stores are valued at weighted average cost. Specific 
provision is made for likely diminution in value, wherever 
required.
2.3 Intangible Assets & Amortisation
2.3.1 Technical know-how/license fee relating to production 
process and process design are recognized as Intangible 
Assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the underlying plant/facility.
2.3.2 Expenditure incurred in research phase is charged to 
revenue and that in development phase, unless it is of 
capital nature, is also charged to revenue.
2.3.3 Cost incurred on computer software/licenses purchased/
developed resulting in future economic benefits, other 
than specific software that are integral part of the 
related hardware, are capitalized as Intangible Asset and 
amortised over a period of three years beginning from the 
month in which such software/licenses are capitalized. 
However, where such computer software/license is under 
development or is not yet ready for use, accumulated cost 
incurred on such items are accounted as “Intangible Assets 
Under Development” .
2.3.4 Right of ways with indefinite useful lives are not amortised 
but tested for impairment annually at the cash-generating 
unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues 
to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
2.3.5 Intangible Assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. The cost of Intangible Assets 
acquired in a business combination is based on its fair 
value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
Intangible Assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. In case 
of internally generated intangibles, development cost is 
recognized as an asset when all the recognition criteria 
are met. However, all other internally generated intangibles 
including research cost are not capitalized and the related 
expenditure is recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
2.3.6 The useful lives of Intangible Assets are assessed as 
either finite or indefinite. Intangible Assets with finite 
lives are amortised over the useful life on straight line 
basis and assessed for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that the Intangible Asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
Intangible Asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to 
modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, 
and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such 
expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset.
2.3.7 On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to 
continue with the carrying value of all of its Intangible 
Assets recognized as at April 1, 2015 measured as per the 
previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed 
cost of the Intangible Assets.
2.3.8 Amortisation is charged pro-rata on monthly basis on 
assets, from/upto the month of capitalization/sale, disposal/
or classified to Asset held for disposal.
2.4 Depreciation
2.4.1 Cost of PPE (net of residual value) excluding freehold land 
is depreciated on straight-line method as per the useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Act except in case of the 
following assets:
 a. Useful life based on technical assessment
  • 15 years for Plant and Equipment relating to 
Retail Outlets (other than storage tanks and 
related equipment), LPG cylinders and pressure 
regulators
  • 25 years for solar power plant
  • Certain assets of R&D Centre (15-25 years)

 b. In case of specific agreements e.g., enabling assets 
etc., useful life as per agreement or Schedule II to the 
Act, whichever is lower.
 c. In case of immovable assets constructed on leasehold 
land, useful life as per Schedule-II to the Act or lease 
period of land (including renewable/likely renewable 
period), whichever is lower and.
 d. In case where useful life is mandated as per the other 
relevant statute or any of the regulation.

terms and conditions are generally accounted for as a re-
measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding 
adjustment to the ROU asset. Any gain or loss on

low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are 
considered of low value and is not intended for sublease. 
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term or another systematic basis if that basis is more 
representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit.
3.2 Leases as Lessor (assets given on lease)
3.2.1 When the company acts as lessor, it determines at the 
commencement of the lease whether it is a finance lease or 
an operating lease.
3.2.2 Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except 
where another systematic basis is more representative of 
the time pattern of the benefit derived from the asset given 
on lease.
3.2.3 All assets given on finance lease are shown as receivables 
at an amount equal to net investment in the lease. Principal 
component of the lease receipts is adjusted against 
outstanding receivables and interest income is accounted 
by applying the interest rate implicit in the lease to the net 
investment. If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Company applies principles enunciated in 
Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” , to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
3.2.4 When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for 
its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. 
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with 
reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease, not 
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a 
short-term lease to which the Company applies the short-
term lease exemption described above, then it classifies the 
sub-lease as an operating lease.
4.  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets (Also Refer Para 14 
for Impairment of E&P Assets)
 The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for 
an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value 
less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount 
is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does 
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets or groups of assets.
 Impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of 
an asset exceeds recoverable amount.
 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations 
are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other available fair value 
indicators.
 The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed 
budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared 
separately for each of the Company’s CGUs to which the 
individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast 
calculations generally cover a period of 15 years. For longer 
periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to 
project future cash flows after the fifteenth year. To estimate 
cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most 
recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates cash 
flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining 
growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate 
can be justified.
 For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is an indication 
that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist 
or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company 
estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A 
previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there 
has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognized for the asset in prior years.
5. Borrowing Costs
 Borrowing cost consists of interest and other cost incurred 
in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
 Depreciation is charged pro-rata on monthly basis on 
assets, from/up to the month of capitalization/sale, 
disposal/or classified to Asset held for disposal.
 Residual value is determined considering past experience 
and generally the same is between 0% to 5% of cost of 
assets except:
 a. In case of Steel LPG cylinder and pressure regulator, 
residual value is considered maximum at 25% and in 
case of fibre composite LPG cylinder, residual value is 
considered at 10% based on estimated realisable value
 b. In case of catalyst with noble metal content, residual 
value is considered based on the cost of metal content 
and
 c. In few cases residual value is considered based on 
transfer value agreed in respective agreement.
 The Company depreciates components of the main asset 
that are significant in value and have different useful lives 
as compared to the main asset separately. The Company 
depreciates spares over the life of the spare from the date it 
is available for use.
2.4.2 PPE, other than LPG Cylinders and Pressure Regulators, 
costing upto H 5,000/- per item are depreciated fully in 
the year of capitalization. Further, spares, components like 
catalyst excluding noble metal content and major overhaul/ 
inspection are also depreciated fully over their respective 
useful life.
2.4.3 The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation 
of PPE are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
2.5 Derecognition
2.5.1 PPE and Intangible Assets are derecognized upon disposal 
or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset or disposal. Any gain or 
loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE 
or Intangible Asset is determined as the difference between 
the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3. Leases
 The Company assesses at contract inception whether a 
contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
3.1 Leases as Lessee (Assets taken on lease)
 The Company applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
3.1.1  Lease Liabilities
 At the commencement date of the lease, the Company 
recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including in substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise 
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating 
a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising 
the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do 
not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense 
in the period on which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.
 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is 
not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the 
amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion 
of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.
 The Company accounts for each lease component 
within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease 
components of the contract and allocates the consideration 
in the contract to each lease component on the basis of 
the relative stand-alone price of the lease component 
and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease 
components, except for leases where the company has 
elected to use practical expedient not to separate non-lease 
payments from the calculation of the lease liability and ROU 
asset where the entire consideration is treated as lease 
component.
3.1.2 Right-of-use Assets
 The Company recognizes right-of-use (ROU) assets 
at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date 
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, 
initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to 
obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease 
term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful 
life and the lease term. Right-of use assets are subject to 
impairment. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the 
Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects 
the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated 
using the estimated useful life of the asset as per 2.4 above. 
Perpetual Right of use (ROU) assets related to land are not 
depreciated but tested for Impairment loss, if any.

and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due 
to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
8.1.4  Decommissioning Liability
 Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value 
of expected cost to settle the obligation using estimated 
cash flows and are recognized as part of the cost of the 
particular asset. The cash flows are discounted at a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the 
decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
expensed as incurred and recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss as a finance cost. The estimated future cost 
of decommissioning is reviewed annually and adjusted as 
appropriate. Changes in the estimated future cost or in the 
discount rate applied are adjusted in the cost of the asset.
8.2 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
8.2.1 Show-cause notices issued by various Government 
Authorities are generally not considered as obligations.
8.2.2 When the demand notices are raised against such show 
cause notices and are disputed by the Company, these are 
classified as disputed obligations.
8.2.3 The treatment in respect of disputed obligations are as 
under:
 a) a provision is recognized in respect of present 
obligations where the outflow of resources is probable 
as per 8.1.1 above;
 b) all other cases are disclosed as contingent liabilities 
unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote.
8.2.4 Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from 
past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future 
events not wholly within the control of the Company. Where 
it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the 
obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent 
liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the 
management/independent experts and reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date to reflect the current management 
estimate.
8.2.5 Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
towards capital expenditure are considered for disclosure.
8.2.6 A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic 
benefits is probable.
9. Revenue
9.1 Revenue From Contracts With Customers
9.1.1 The Company is in the business of oil and gas operations 
and it earns revenue primarily from sale of petroleum and 
petrochemical products. In addition, the company also 
earns revenue from other businesses which comprises Gas, 
Exploration & Production and Others.
 Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects 
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified 
in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties.
 The Company has generally concluded that it is the 
principal in its revenue arrangements, except a few agency 
services, because it typically controls the goods or services 
before transferring them to the customer.
 The Company considers whether there are other promises 
in the contract that are separate performance obligations 
to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be 
allocated (e.g., customer loyalty points). In determining the 
transaction price for the sale of products, the Company 
considers the effects of variable consideration, the 
existence of significant financing components, non-cash 
consideration and consideration payable to the customer (if 
any).
9.1.2 Revenue from the sale of petroleum products, petrochemical 
products, crude and gas are recognized at a point in time, 
generally upon delivery of the products. The Company 
recognizes revenue over time using input method (on the 
basis of time elapsed) in case of non-refundable deposits 
from dealers and service contracts. In case of construction 
contracts, revenue and cost are recognized by measuring 
the contract progress using input method by comparing the 
cost incurred and total contract cost. Contract modifications 
are accounted for as a part of existing contract or separate 
contract based on conditions prescribed in Ind AS 115.
9.1.3 The Company has assumed that recovery of excise duty 
flows to the Company on its own account. This is for the 
reason that it is a liability of the manufacturer which forms 
part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the 
goods are sold or not. Since the recovery of excise duty 
flows to the Company on its own account, revenue includes 
excise duty.
 However, Sales Tax/Goods and Services Tax (GST) and 
Value Added Tax (VAT) is not received by the company on 
its own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added 
to the product by the seller on behalf of the government. 
Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.
9.1.4  Variable consideration
 If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, 
the Company estimates the amount of consideration 
to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring 
the goods to the customer. The variable consideration 
is estimated at contract inception and constrained until 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
that are attributable to the acquisition or construction of 
the qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of 
such asset. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes 
substantial period of time to get ready for intended use. 
Capitalization of borrowing costs is suspended when active 
development activity on the qualifying assets is interrupted 
other than on temporary basis and charged to the Statement 
of Profit and Loss during such extended periods. All other 
borrowing costs are recognized in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss in the period in which the same are incurred.
6. Foreign Currency Transactions
6.1 The Company’s financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupee (H), which is also it’s functional currency.
6.2 Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded at spot 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction.
6.3 Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies (such as 
cash, receivables, payables etc.) outstanding at the end of 
reporting period, are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
on that date.
6.4 Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency, 
(such as PPE, intangible assets, equity investments, capital/ 
revenue advances other than expected to be settled in cash 
etc.) are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction, other than those measured at fair value.
 Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date 
when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences 
on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or the Statement of Profit and 
Loss are also recognized in OCI or the Statement of Profit and 
Loss, respectively).
6.5 Any gains or losses arising due to differences in exchange 
rates at the time of translation or settlement are accounted 
for in the Statement of Profit and Loss either under the head 
foreign exchange fluctuation or interest cost to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs as the case 
may be, except those relating to loans mentioned below.
 Exchange differences on long-term foreign currency loans 
obtained or re-financed on or before March 31, 2016 relating to 
acquisition of depreciable assets are adjusted to the carrying 
cost of the assets and depreciated over the balance life of the 
assets.
7. Inventories
7.1 Raw Materials & Stock-in-Process
7.1.1 Raw materials including crude oil are valued at cost 
determined on weighted average basis or net realisable 
value, whichever is lower.
7.1.2 Stock in Process is valued at raw materials cost plus 
processing cost as applicable or net realisable value, 
whichever is lower.
7.1.3 Crude oil in Transit is valued at cost or net realisable value, 
whichever is lower.
7.1.4 Initial cost of inventories includes the transfer of gains and 
losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognized in OCI, 
in respect of the purchases of raw materials.
7.2 Finished Products and Stock-in-Trade
7.2.1 Finished Products and Stock in Trade, other than lubricants, 
are valued at cost determined on ‘First in First Out’ basis or 
net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of Finished 
Products internally produced is determined based on raw 
materials cost and processing cost.
7.2.2 Lubricants are valued at cost on weighted average basis or 
net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of lubricants 
internally produced is determined based on cost of inputs 
and processing cost.
7.2.3 Imported products in transit are valued at cost or net 
realisable value whichever is lower.
7.3 Stores and Spares
7.3.1 Stores and Spares (including chemicals, packing containers 
i.e. empty barrels, tins etc.) are valued at weighted average 
cost. Specific provision is made in respect of identified 
obsolete stores & spares and chemicals for likely diminution 
in value. Further, a provision @ 5% of cost is also made 
on the balance stores and spares (excluding barrels, tins, 
stores in transit, chemicals/catalysts, crude oil, and own 
products) towards likely diminution in the value.
7.3.2 Stores and Spares in transit are valued at cost.
8.  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets
8.1 Provisions
8.1.1 Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation.
8.1.2 When the Company expects some or all of a provision to 
be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized 
as a separate asset but only when it is virtually certain 
and amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss net of reimbursement, if any.
8.1.3 If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money

salary and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss/
CWIP. Shortfall, if any, in the fund assets, based on the 
Government specified minimum rate of return, is made 
good by the Company and charged to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss/CWIP.
 b) The Company operates defined benefit plans for Gratuity, 
Post-Retirement Medical Benefits, Resettlement, 
Felicitation Scheme and Ex-gratia. The cost of providing 
such defined benefits is determined using the projected 
unit credit method of actuarial valuation made at the 
end of the year. Out of these plans, Gratuity and Post-
Retirement Medical Benefits are administered through 
respective Trusts.
 c) Obligations on other long term employee benefits 
viz Leave Encashment and Long Service Awards are 
provided using the projected unit credit method of 
actuarial valuation made at the end of the year. Out of 
these obligations, Leave Encashment obligations are 
funded through qualifying insurance policies made with 
insurance companies.
 d) The Company also operates a defined contribution 
scheme for Pension benefits for its employees and the 
contribution is remitted to a separate Trust/Corporate 
NPS.
12.3 Termination Benefits:
 Payments made under Voluntary Retirement Scheme are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on incurrence.
12.4 Remeasurements:
 Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding amounts included in 
net interest on the net defined benefit liability) and the return 
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability), are recognized immediately 
in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit 
to retained earnings through Other Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurements 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Remeasurements in respect of other long-term benefits are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss on the earlier 
of:
 • The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
 • The date that the Company recognizes related 
restructuring cost
 Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognizes 
the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as 
an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss:
 • Service cost comprising current service cost, past-
service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and non-
routine settlements; and
 • Net interest expense or income
13. Grants
13.1   Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with.
13.2 Grant relating to Assets (Capital Grants)
 In case of grants relating to depreciable assets, the cost of the 
asset is shown at gross value and grant thereon is treated as 
Deferred income which are recognized as “Other Operating 
Revenues” usually in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the 
period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged.
13.3 Grant related to Income (Revenue Grants)
 Revenue grants are recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the 
entity recognizes as expenses the related cost for which the 
grants are intended to compensate.
 Subsidy and budgetary support towards under recoveries are 
recognized in “Revenue from Operations” as per schemes 
notified by Government from time to time, subject to final 
adjustments, wherever applicable.
 The Company has treated waiver of duty under EPCG Scheme 
as revenue grant as the condition of meeting the export 
obligations is a primary condition of availing the grant as per 
the EPCG Scheme. The above grant is set up by recording 
the assets at gross value and corresponding grant amount as 
deferred income. Such grant is recognized in “Other Operating 
Revenues” in proportion of export obligations actually fulfilled 
during the accounting period. In case of post export EPCG 
Duty Credit Scrip Scheme, revenue grant is recognized in 
“Other Operating Revenues” equivalent to the amount of 
Custom duty remission in proportion to export obligations 
actually fulfilled during the accounting period.
 Revenue grants are generally recorded under “Other 
Operating Revenues” , except north east excise duty exemption 
which is netted off with the related expense.
13.4   When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments 
or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current 
applicable market rate or NIL interest rate, the effect of this 
favourable interest is regarded as a government grant. The 
loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured at fair 
value and the government grant is measured as the difference 
between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds 
received. The loan is subsequently measured as per the 
accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities. Classification 
of the grant is made considering the terms and condition of the 
grant i.e. whether grants relates to assets or otherwise.
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal 
in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not 
occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable 
consideration is subsequently resolved
 The Company provides volume rebates to certain customers 
once the quantity of products purchased during the period 
exceeds a threshold specified in the contract. Rebates 
are offset against amounts payable by the customer. 
The volume rebates/ cash discount give rise to variable 
consideration. To estimate the variable consideration for 
the expected future rebates/ cash discount, the Company 
applies the most likely amount method for contracts with 
a single-volume threshold and the expected value method 
for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The 
selected method that best predicts the amount of variable 
consideration is primarily driven by the number of volume 
thresholds contained in the contract and accordingly, the 
Company recognizes a refund liability for the expected 
future rebates.
9.1.5  Loyalty Points
 The Company operates various loyalty point schemes. The 
transaction price allocated to customer loyalty points is 
based on their relative estimated standalone selling price and 
the same is reduced from revenue from sale of goods. While 
estimating standalone selling price of customer loyalty points, 
the likelihood of exercising the option is adjusted. Wherever 
the Company is acting as an agent in this arrangement, the 
Company recognize the revenue on net basis.
9.2  Other claims are recognized when there is a reasonable 
certainty of recovery.
10. Excise Duty
 Excise duty is accounted on the basis of both, payments made 
in respect of goods cleared as also provision made for goods 
lying in stock. Value of stock includes excise duty payable/ 
paid on finished goods, wherever applicable.
11. Taxes on Income
11.1  Current Income Tax
 Provision for current tax is made as per the provisions of the 
Income Tax Act, 1961.
 Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted, at the reporting date.
 Current income tax relating to items recognized outside profit 
or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to 
situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to 
interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.
11.2  Deferred Tax
11.2.1 Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet method 
on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable 
temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss.
 Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences, and any unused tax losses. Deferred 
tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profit will be available in future against which 
the deductible temporary differences, and unused tax 
losses can be utilized, except when the deferred tax asset 
relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor 
taxable profit or loss.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
11.2.2 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
in future to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be 
utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
11.2.3 Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit 
or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity).
11.2.4 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
12. Employee Benefits
12.1 Short Term Benefits:
 Short Term Employee Benefits are accounted for in the period 
during which the services have been rendered.
12.2  Post-Employment Benefits and Other Long Term 
Employee Benefits:
 a) The Company’s contribution to the Provident Fund is 
remitted to separate trusts established for this purpose 
based on a fixed percentage of the eligible employee’s

 • Held primarily for the purpose of trading
 • Expected to be realised within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 • Cash or Cash Equivalents unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
 All other assets are classified as non-current.
15.2 A liability is treated as current when:
 • It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
 • It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
 • It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 • There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of 
the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period
 All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
16. Non-Current Assets Held For Sale
16.1 The Company classifies non-current assets and disposal 
groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be 
recovered principally through a sale rather than through 
continuing use. Actions required to complete the sale should 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale 
will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. 
Management must be committed to the sale expected within 
one year from the date of classification.
16.2 For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of 
non-current assets for other non-current assets when the 
exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for held for 
sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
for sales (or disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; and 
it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The Company treats 
sale of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when:
 • The appropriate level of management is committed to a 
plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),
 • An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the 
plan has been initiated (if applicable),
 • The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed 
for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
 • The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification, and
 • Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is 
unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made 
or that the plan will be withdrawn.
16.3 Non-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair 
value less cost to sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held 
for sale are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.
 PPE and Intangible Assets once classified as held for sale are 
not depreciated or amortised.
17. Financial Instruments
 A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
17.1 Financial Assets
 Initial recognition and measurement
 All Financial Assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in 
the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction cost that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the Financial Asset. However, trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets measured at 
fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Subsequent measurement
 For the purpose of subsequent measurement, Financial 
Assets are classified in four categories:
 • Financial Assets at amortised cost
 • Debt Instruments at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
 • Equity Instruments at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
 • Financial Assets and derivatives at Fair Value Through 
Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
17.1.1  Financial Assets at Amortised Cost
 A Financial Asset is measured at the amortised cost if both 
the following conditions are met:
 a) The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows,  and
 b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
14. Oil & Gas Exploration Activities
14.1 Pre-acquisition Cost:
 Expenditure incurred before obtaining the right(s) to explore, 
develop and produce oil and gas are expensed as and when 
incurred.
14.2 Exploration Stage:
 Acquisition cost relating to projects under exploration are 
initially accounted as “Intangible Assets under Development” . 
The expenses on oil and gas assets that is classified as 
intangible include:
 – acquired rights to explore
 – exploratory drilling cost
 Cost of Survey and prospecting activities conducted in the 
search of oil and gas are expensed as exploration cost in the 
year in which these are incurred
 If the project is not viable based upon technical feasibility and 
commercial viability study, then all cost relating to Exploratory 
Wells are expensed in the year when determined to be dry.
 If the project is proved to be viable, then all cost relating to 
drilling of Exploratory Wells shall be continued to be presented 
as “Intangible Assets under Development” .
14.3 Development Stage:
 Acquisition cost relating to projects under development stage 
are presented as “Capital Work-in-Progress” .
 When a well is ready to commence commercial production, 
the capitalized cost corresponding to proved developed 
oil and gas reserves is reclassified as ‘Completed wells/ 
Producing wells’ from “Capital Work-in-Progress/ Intangible 
Assets under Development” to the gross block of assets. 
Examples of Oil and Gas assets that might be classified as 
Tangible Assets include development drilling cost, piping and 
pumps and producing wells.
14.4 Production Phase
 Production cost include pre-well head and post-well head 
expenses including depreciation and applicable operating 
cost of support equipment and facilities are expensed off.
 Depletion is calculated using the Unit of Production method 
based upon proved and developed reserves.
14.5 Abandonment Phase
 In case of development/production phase, abandonment/
decommissioning amount is recognized at the present 
value of the estimated future expenditure. Any change in the 
present value of the estimated decommissioning expenditure 
other than the unwinding of discount is adjusted to the 
decommissioning provision and the carrying value of the 
corresponding asset. The unwinding of discount on provision 
is charged in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance costs.
14.6 Impairment of E&P Assets
14.6.1 Impairment testing in case of Development and 
producing assets
 In case of E&P related development and producing 
assets, expected future cash flows are estimated using 
management’s best estimate of future oil and natural gas 
prices, production volumes, proved & probable reserves 
volumes and discount rate. The expected future cash flows 
are estimated on the basis of value in use concept. The 
value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be 
generated by the projected oil or gas production profiles 
up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each 
producing field, based on current estimates of proved and 
probable reserves and on reasonable & supportable fiscal 
assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of 
the range of economic conditions that will exist over the 
remaining useful life of the asset. Management takes a long-
term view of the range of economic conditions over the 
remaining useful life of the asset and, are not based on the 
relatively short-term changes in the economic conditions. 
However, impairment of exploration and evaluation assets 
is to be done in line with para 14.6.2
14.6.2 Impairment in case of Exploration and Evaluation 
assets
 Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for impairment 
where an indicator for impairment exists. In such cases, while 
calculating recoverable amount, in addition to the factors 
mentioned in 14.6.1, management’s best estimate of total 
current reserves and resources are considered (including 
possible and contingent reserve) after appropriately 
adjusting the associated inherent risks. Impairment loss 
is reversed subsequently, to the extent that conditions for 
impairment are no longer present.
14.6.3 Cash generating unit
 In case of E&P Assets, the Company generally considers 
a project as cash generating unit. However, in case 
where the multiple fields are using common production/
transportation facilities and are sufficiently economically 
interdependent the same are considered to constitute a 
single cash generating unit (CGU).
15. Current Versus Non-Current Classification
 The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance 
Sheet based on current/non-current classification as below.
15.1 An asset is treated as current when it is:
 • Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle

17.1.6 Impairment of Financial Assets
 In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies 
Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and 
recognition of impairment loss on the following financial 
assets and credit risk exposure:
 a) Financial Assets that are Debt Instruments, and are 
measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, trade receivables and bank balance
 b) Financial guarantee contracts which are not 
subsequently measured as at FVTPL
 c) Lease Receivables under Ind AS 116
 Simplified Approach
 The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition 
of impairment loss allowance on Trade Receivables.
 The application of simplified approach does not require 
the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it 
recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime 
ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
 As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision 
matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio 
of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over the expected life of 
the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed. On that basis, the Company 
estimates provision on trade receivables at the reporting 
date.
 General Approach
 For recognition of impairment loss on other financial 
assets and risk exposure, the Company determines that 
whether there has been a significant increase in the 
credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not 
increased significantly, 12-months ECL is used to provide 
for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased 
significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, 
credit quality of the instrument improves such that there 
is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing 
impairment loss allowance based on 12-months ECL.
 Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument. The 12-months ECL is a portion of 
the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are 
possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
 ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized 
during the period is recognized as expense /income in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Balance Sheet presentation 
for various financial instruments is described below:
 • Financial Assets measured as at amortised cost: ECL 
is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of 
the measurement of those assets in the Balance Sheet. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until 
the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does 
not reduce impairment allowance from the gross 
carrying amount.
 • Financial Guarantee contracts: ECL is presented as a 
provision in the Balance Sheet, i.e. as a liability.
 • Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since financial 
assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment 
allowance is not further reduced from its value. Rather, 
ECL amount is presented as ‘accumulated impairment 
amount’ in the OCI.
17.2 Financial Liabilities
1 7. 2 .1  Initial recognition and measurement.
 Financial Liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and 
financial liabilities at amortised cost, as appropriate.
 All Financial Liabilities are recognized initially at fair value 
and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, they are measured net of directly 
attributable transaction cost. In case of Financial Liabilities 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
liabilities are recognized immediately in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
 The Company’s Financial Liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings including financial 
guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
17 .2.2  Subsequent measurement
 The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as described below:
 A. Financial Liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
  Financial Liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
include financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at 
fair value through the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Financial Liabilities are classified as held for trading if 
they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes derivative 
financial instruments entered into by the Company 
that are not designated as hedging instruments in 
hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
 After initial measurement, such Financial Assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or cost that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income 
in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognized in the profit or loss. Apart from the same, any 
income or expense arising from remeasurement of financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, in accordance with 
Ind AS 109, is recognized in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables.
1 7.1. 2  Debt Instrument at FVTOCI
 A ‘Debt Instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of 
the following criteria are met:
 a) The objective of the business model is achieved both 
by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the 
financial assets, and
 b) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI).
 Debt Instruments included within the FVTOCI category are 
measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value. Fair Value movements are recognized in the Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI). However, the Company 
recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals 
and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the 
Equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned 
whilst holding FVTOCI Debt Instrument is reported as 
interest income using the EIR method.
17.1.3 Equity Instrument
 A. Equity Investments at FVTOCI (Other than 
Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and Associates)
  All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are 
measured at fair value. The Company has made an 
irrevocable election to present subsequent changes 
in the fair value in Other Comprehensive Income. The 
classification is made on initial recognition/transition 
and is irrevocable.
  There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to 
the Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of 
investments.
 B. Equity Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures 
and Associates
  Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and 
Associates are accounted for at cost in the financial 
statements and the same are tested for impairment in 
case of any indication of impairment.
 C. Dividend income is recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the Company’s right to receive 
dividend is established.
1 7.1.4  Debt Instruments and Derivatives at FVTPL
 FVTPL is a residual category for Debt Instruments. Any 
debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is 
classified as at FVTPL.
 This category also includes derivative financial instruments 
entered into by the Company that are not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
Ind AS 109.
 Debt Instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest income on such 
instruments has been presented under interest income.
17.1.5 Derecognition
 A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognized (i.e. removed from the Balance Sheet) when:
 • The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
 • The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay 
the received cash flows in full without material delay to 
a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
 When the Company has transferred its rights to receive 
cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent 
it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Company continues to recognize the 
transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Company also recognizes an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Company has retained.
 Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over 
the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original 
carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of 
consideration that the Company could be required to repay.

hedge is actually have been highly effective throughout the 
financial reporting periods for which it was designated.
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated 
under the heading Cash Flow Hedge Reserve within Equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized 
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss and included 
in the Other Income or Other Expenses as Gain on Derivatives 
or Loss on Derivatives respectively.
 Amounts previously recognized in OCI and accumulated 
in equity relating to effective portion are reclassified 
to Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line item as 
the recognized hedged item or treated as basis adjustment 
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability. 
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting.
17.5.2 Derivatives that are not designated as hedge 
instrument
 The Company enters into certain derivative contracts to 
hedge risks which are not designated as hedges. Such 
contracts are accounted for at fair value through the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and are included in the Other 
Income or Other Expenses as Gain on Derivatives or Loss 
on Derivatives respectively.
17.6 Commodity Contracts
 Commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to 
be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-
financial item in accordance with the Company’s expected 
purchase, sale or usage requirements are held at cost.
18. Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdraft 
(negative balance in Account) is shown under short term 
borrowings under Financial Liabilities & Positive balance in 
that account is shown in Cash & Cash Equivalents.
19. Treasury Shares
 Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation, IOC Shares Trust 
has been set up by IOCL for holding treasury shares in relation 
to IBP and BRPL mergers. The shares held by IOC Shares 
Trust are treated as treasury shares.
 Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) 
are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or 
loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own 
equity instruments.
20. Fair Value Measurement
20.1 The Company measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.
20.2 The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either in the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal 
or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the 
Company.
20.3 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in 
their economic best interest.
20.4 A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.
20.5 The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate 
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are 
available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable 
inputs.
20.6 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
 Level 1-  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities
 Level 2-  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
 Level 3-  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
 For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the 
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
 B. Financial Liabilities at amortised cost
  Financial Liabilities that are not held-for-trading and 
are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at 
amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting 
periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities 
that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are 
determined based on the effective interest method. 
Gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or cost that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as finance costs in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 C. Financial Guarantee Contracts
  Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company 
are those contracts that require a payment to be made 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because 
the specified debtor fails to make the payment when 
due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially 
as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction cost 
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at 
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined 
as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the 
amount initially recognized less cumulative income 
recognized in accordance with principles of Ind AS 115.
17.2.3 Derecognition
 A Financial Liability is derecognized when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
17.3 Embedded Derivatives
 If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a Financial Asset 
within the scope of Ind AS 109, the Company does not separate 
embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies the classification 
requirements contained in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid 
contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts 
are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair 
value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not held for trading or designated at fair value through 
profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at 
fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or 
loss, unless designated as effective hedging instruments. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the 
terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows 
that would otherwise be required or a reclassification of a 
financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss.
17.4 Offsetting of Financial Instruments
 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and 
there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
17.5  Derivative Instrument - Initial recognition/subsequent 
measurement
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps and forward 
commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, 
interest rate risks and commodity price risks, respectively. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized 
at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. 
The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value of 
derivatives depends on the designation or non- designation of 
derivative as hedging instruments. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
17.5.1 Derivative that are designated as Hedge Instrument
 The Company undertakes foreign exchange forward 
contracts, commodity forward contracts and interest 
rates swap contracts for hedging foreign currency risks, 
commodity price risks and interest rate risks respectively. 
The Company generally designates the whole forward 
contract as hedging instrument. These hedges are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges. These hedging 
instruments are as per the policies approved by the Board 
of Directors.
 At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company 
formally designates and documents the hedge relationship 
to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting 
and the risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes the 
Company’s risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking hedge, the hedging/ economic relationship, 
the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk 
being hedged, hedge ratio and how the entity will assess 
the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s 
fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the 
hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the  
hedged risk.
 Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in 
achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that the

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition Notes to Financial Statements 
NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of 
contingent liabilities. These include recognition and measurement 
of financial instruments, estimates of useful lives and residual value 
of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets, valuation 
of inventories, measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units, measurement of employee benefits, actuarial 
assumptions, provisions etc.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount 
of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The Company 
continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on 
the most recently available information. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized prospectively in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss in the period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future periods affected.
A. JUDGEMENTS
 In the process of applying the company’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, which 
have the significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements:
 Materiality
 Ind AS requires assessment of materiality by the Company 
for accounting and disclosure of various transactions 
in the financial statements. Accordingly, the Company 
assesses materiality limits for various items for accounting 
and disclosures and follows on a consistent basis. Overall 
materiality is also assessed based on various financial 
parameters such as Gross Block of assets, Net Block of 
Assets, Total Assets, Revenue and Profit Before Tax. The 
materiality limits are reviewed and approved by the Board.
 Intangible Asset under Development
 Acquisition costs and drilling of exploratory well costs are 
capitalized as intangible asset under development and are 
reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that exploration 
drilling is still under way or work has been determined / under 
way to determine that the discovery is economically viable 
based on a range of technical & commercial considerations 
and for establishing development plans and timing, sufficient 
/ reasonable progress is being made. If no future activity is 
planned on reasonable grounds / timeframes, Intangible 
asset under development and property acquisition costs is 
written off. Upon start of production from field and recognition 
of proved reserves, cost carried as intangible asset under 
development is transferred to producing properties. Also refer 
Note-34 for related disclosures.
 Contingencies
 Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of 
business in relation to claims against the Company, including 
legal, contractor, land access and other claims. By their 
nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more 
uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment 
of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies 
inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and 
the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events.
B. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, 
are described below.
 Existing circumstances and assumptions about future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes 
or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the 
company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions 
when they occur.
 Defined benefit plans/Other Long term employee benefits
 The cost of the defined benefit plans and other long term 
employee benefit plans are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in 
the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term 
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date.
 The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. 
The management considers the interest rates of government 
securities based on expected settlement period of various 
plans.
 Further details about various employee benefit obligations are 
given in Note 35.
 Fair value measurement of financial instruments
 When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the Balance Sheet cannot be measured based on 
quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash 
Flow (DCF) model based on level-2 and level-3 inputs. 
The inputs to these models are taken from observable 
markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. 
Judgements include considerations of inputs such as price 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
 In case of Level 3 valuations, external valuers are also involved 
in some cases for valuation of assets and liabilities, such as 
unquoted financial assets, loans to related parties etc.
 For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the 
level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
21. Earnings Per Share
 The basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing 
the net profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable to the 
equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for 
bonus elements in equity shares issued during the year and 
excluding treasury shares. The Company did not have any 
potentially dilutive securities in the years presented.

CHANGES EFFECTIVE APRIL 1,2022 OR THEREAFTER

amendments to the existing standards. On 31st March 
2023, vide Notification G.S.R. 242(E) dated 31st March 2023, 
modifications in existing standards have been notified which 
will be applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
 a.  Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements:
  The amendment proposes the company to disclose material 
accounting policy information rather than significant 
accounting policy. An accounting policy information 
is material if, when considered together with other 
information included in an entity’s financial statements, 
it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that 
the primary users of general-purpose financial statements 
make on the basis of those financial statements. The 
effective date for adoption of this amendment is reporting 
periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The effect of this 
amendment is expected to be insignificant.
 b.  Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors:
  The amendments propose new definition of “Accounting 
Estimates” which replaces the definition of “Change 
in Accounting Estimates” . As per the new definition, 
“Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial 
statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty” . 
The effective date of this amendment is reporting periods 
beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The effect of this 
amendment is expected to be insignificant.
 c. Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes:
  The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial 
recognition exemption so that it does not apply to 
transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting 
temporary differences. in context to leases and 
decommissioning liabilities. Subsequently, post this 
amendment, the company need to recognize deferred 
tax asset and liability on lease and decommissioning 
liability. The effective date of this amendment is reporting 
periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The effect of 
this amendment is expected to be insignificant.

estimates, volume estimates, rate estimates etc. Changes in 
assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair 
value of financial instruments. Also refer Note 39 for further 
disclosures of estimates and assumptions.
 Impairment of Financial Assets
 The impairment provisions for trade receivables are made 
considering simplified approach based on assumptions about 
risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the 
inputs to the impairment calculation based on the company’s 
past history and other factors at the end of each reporting 
period. In case of other financial assets, the Company applies 
general approach for recognition of impairment losses 
wherein the Company uses judgement in considering the 
probability of default upon initial recognition and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an 
ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. Also refer 
Note-40 for impairment analysis and provision.
 Income Taxes
 The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the 
relevant facts, circumstances, present and past experience, 
rulings, and new pronouncements while determining the 
provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences 
and tax losses can be utilised.

NOTE - 2: PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Contd..)
A. i) Freehold Land includes H1.61 crore (2022: H1.61 crore) lying vacant due to title disputes/litigation.
 ii) Out of the Freehold land measuring 1364.01 acres at Mathura and Agra regions, land measuring 50 acres (approx) has been 
acquired by NHAI as a part of the NH2 widening project for which the determination of value of compensation is pending. 
Accordingly, the value of land amounting to H1.18 crore is continued to be included in Freehold land.
 iii) Freehold Land of 490 acres at Guwahati Refinery includes land parcel of approx. 32.39 acres (Costing H0.05 crore) on which 
public roads, drains etc. have been constructed by PWD, Govt. of Assam.
 iv) Freehold Land includes H41.75 crore of compensation paid in respect of land at Panipat Refinery as per District and High court 
orders of earlier dates, which was later quashed by subsequent High Court order dated 18.12.2019. Since, the process of recovery 
of compensation already paid, has been stayed by Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 21.09.2020, necessary adjustment 
shall be made in the cost of the land upon actual recovery, if any.
B. i) Buildings include H0.01 crore (2022: H0.01 crore) towards 1605 (2022: 1605) nos. of shares in Co-operative Housing Societies 
towards membership of such societies for purchase of flats.
 ii) Includes Roads, Bridges etc. (i.e. Assets other than Building) of Gross block amounting to H6077.96 crore (2022: H5122.57 crore) 
and net block amounting to H3302.68 crore (2022: H2834.91 crore).
C. Depreciation and amortisation for the year includes H68.39 crore (2022: H19.09 crore) relating to construction period expenses shown 
in ‘Note - 2.2’
D. Land and Buildings (Including ROU Asset) include H899.37 crore (2022: H742.19 crore) in respect of which Title/ Lease Deeds are 
pending for execution or renewal.
E. During the year, company has provided an impairment loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the Head ‘Depreciation, 
Amortisation and Impairment on Tangible Assets’ on windmills in Rajasthan of H18.94 crore (2022: H82.55 crore) considering 
uncertainty over availment of eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) and retaining tariff of H 3.14/Kwh as per RRECL order 
dated 05.03.2019.
F. Hitherto, the estimated residual value of LPG cylinders (other than composite cylinders) and Pressure Regulators was considered as 
15% of original cost. Based on realization of scrap value in recent past, the estimated residual value of those assets has been increased 
from 15% to 25% of original cost effective from April 01, 2022. The impact on account of above change is reduction in depreciation 
charge by H293.08 crore in FY 2022-23 which will be offset over future periods in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
G. During the year, classification of Retail Visual Identity (RVI) elements has been reviewed and some of the items having gross block of 
H1,213.06 crore classified under Buildings, Plant & Equipment and Office Equipments have been reclassified as ‘Furniture and Fixtures’ . 
The impact on account of this change is increase in depreciation charge by H 61.31 crore during FY 2022-23 which will be offset over 
future periods in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
H. Railways had claimed transfer of ownership of certain assets provided by the Company at Railway premises which was not accepted 
in prior years by the Company and the said assets were continued to be part of Plant, Property & Equipment of the Company. 
Railways, in its latest tender has asserted its position on ownership of these assets and has again maintained status quo in their 
earlier stand/position during FY 2022-23. Management has accepted Railways’ contention in view of the continued business relation. 
Consequently, assets amounting to H81.26 crore (WDV as on 01.04.2022) has been derecognized and charged to loss on sale/disposal 
of assets during the year.
I. For further details regarding ROU Assets, refer ‘Note - 36’ .
J. In accordance with the requirements prescribed under Schedule II to Companies Act, 2013, the Company has adopted useful lives as 
prescribed in that schedule except in some cases as per point no. 2.4.1 of significant accounting policies (Note-1).

service subject to maximum of H0.20 crore at the time of separation from the company. Besides, the ceiling of gratuity increases by 
25% whenever IDA rises by 50% with reference to January 01, 2017.
 Post Retirement Medical Benefit Facility (PRMBF):
 PRMBF provides medical coverage to retired employees and their eligible dependant family members.
 Resettlement Benefit:
 Resettlement benefit is allowed to employees to facilitate them to settle down upon retirement.
 Ex gratia Scheme:
 Ex-gratia is payable to those employees who have retired before January 01, 2007 and either not drawing pension from superannuation 
benefit fund (as they superannuated prior to January 01, 1987, i.e. introduction of superannuation benefit fund scheme in IndianOil) or 
are drawing a pension lower than the ex gratia fixed for a Grade (in such case differential amount between pension and ex gratia is

C. Other Long-Term Employee Benefits - General Description
 Leave Encashment:
 Each employee is entitled to get 8 earned leaves for each completed quarter of service. Encashment of earned leaves is allowed during 
service leaving a minimum balance of 15 days subject to maximum accumulation of 300 days. In addition, each employee is entitled 
to get 5 sick leaves (in lieu of 10 Half Pay Leave) at the end of every six months. The entire accumulation of sick leave is permitted 
for encashment only at the time of retirement. DPE had clarified earlier that sick leave cannot be encashed, though Earned Leave 
(EL) and Half Pay Leave (HPL) could be considered for encashment on retirement subject to the overall limit of 300 days. Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has advised the company to comply with the said DPE Guidelines. However, in compliance to 
the DPE guidelines of 1987 which had allowed framing of own leave rules within broad parameters laid down by the Government and 
keeping in view operational complications and service agreements the company had requested concerned authorities to reconsider 
the matter. Subsequently, based on the recommendation of the 3rd Pay Revision Committee, DPE in its guidelines on pay revision, 
effective from January 01, 2017 has inter-alia allowed CPSEs to frame their own leave rules considering operational necessities and 
subject to conditions set therein. The requisite conditions are fully met by the company.
 Long Service Award:
 On completion of specified period of service with the company and also at the time of retirement, employees are rewarded with 
amounts based on the length of service completed. It is a mode of recognizing long years of loyalty and faithful service in line with 
Bureau of Public Enterprises (currently DPE) advice vide its DO No. 7(3)/79-BPE (GM.I) dated February 14, 1983. On receipt of 
communication from MoPNG advising us that the issue of Long Service Award has been made into an audit para in the Annual Report 
of CAG of 2019, the Corporation has been clarifying its position to MoPNG individually as well as on industry basis as to how Long 
Service Awards are not in the nature of Bonus or Ex-gratia or honorarium and is emanating from a settlement with the unions under 
the Industrial Dispute Act as well as with the approval of the Board in line with the DPE’s advice of 1983. The matter is being pursued 
with MoPNG for resolution. Pending this the provision is in line with Board approved policy.
 Leave Fare Allowance (LFA) / Leave Travel Concession (LTC):
 LTC is allowed once in a period of two calendar years (viz. two yearly block). An employee has, in any given block period of two years, 
an option of availing LTC or encashing the entilements of LFA.

 Notes:
 1. The management has assessed that fair values of Trade Receivables, Trade Payables, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Bank Balances 
& Bank Deposits, Loans (incl. Security Deposits) other than mentioned above, Short Term Borrowings (incl. Current Maturities of 
Long Term Borrowings), Floating Rate Borrowings, Lease Liabilities, Other Non-Derivative Current/Non-Current Financial Assets 
& Other Non-Derivative Current/Non-Current Financial Liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.
 2. During the year, the management has re-assessed viability of the project being carried out by Suntera Nigeria 205 Limited. Due 
to uncertainty involved in carrying out operations and non-utilisation of available reserves of Block - OML 142, the management 
has assessed the fair value of investment and loan advanced to Suntera Nigeria 205 Limited as NIL.
 Methods and Assumptions
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values at the reporting date:
 A.  Level 1 Hierarchy:
  (i) Quoted Equity Shares: Closing quoted price (unadjusted) in National Stock Exchange of India Limited
  (ii) Quoted Government Securities: Closing published price (unadjusted) in Clearing Corporation of India Limited
  (iii) Foreign Currency Bonds - US Dollars: Closing price (unadjusted) for the specific bond collected from active market
 B.  Level 2 Hierarchy:
  (i) Derivative Instruments at FVTPL: Replacement cost quoted by institutions for similar instruments by employing use of 
market observable inputs.
  (ii) Hedging Derivatives at FVTOCI: Replacement cost quoted by institutions for similar instruments by employing use of market 
observable inputs.
  (iii) Loans to employees: Discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for items on similar terms, credit risk 
and remaining maturities, adjusted for insignificant unobservable inputs specific to such loan like principal and interest 
repayments are such that employee get more flexibility in repayment as per the respective loan schemes.
  (iv) Non-Convertible Debentures, Loan from Odisha Government and USD 100 Mn Term Loan: Discounting future cash flows using 
rates currently available for items on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities (Excluding floating rate borrowings).
 C.  Level 3 Hierarchy:
  (i) Unquoted Equity Instruments: Fair values of the unquoted equity shares have been estimated using Market Approach of valuation 
techniques with the help of external valuer. Valuation as per this technique is determined by comparing the company’s accounting 
ratios with another company’s of the same nature and size which are considered to be significant to valuation, such as earnings, 
cash flow, book value, or sales of various business of the same nature. The probabilities of the various estimates within the range 
can be reasonably assessed and are used in management’s estimate of fair value for these unquoted equity investments.
  (ii) Non Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares, Compulsorily Convertible Debentures (CCDs): Fair value of Preference 
shares, CCDs is estimated with the help of external valuer by discounting future cash flows. The valuation requires 
management to use unobservable inputs in the model, of which the significant unobservable inputs are disclosed in the 
tables below. Management regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable 
inputs and determines their impact on the total fair value.

 Financial Assets
 1.  Loan to Employees
  As per the terms of service, the Company has given long term loan to its employees at concessional interest rate. Transaction 
price is not fair value because loans are not extended at market rates applicable to employees. Since implied benefit is on the 
basis of the services rendered by the employee, it is deferred and recognized as employee benefit expense over the loan period.
 2. PMUY loan
  The PMUY loan is the interest free loan given to PMUY beneficiaries towards cost of burner and 1st refill. The loan is interest 
free and therefore transaction price is not at fair value. The difference between fair value and transaction price is accumulated in 
Deferred expenses and amortized over the loan period on straight line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Financial Liabilities
 1.  Security Deposits
  In case certain deposits payable to deceased employees under one of the superannuation benefit scheme (R2 option) and 
security deposits received in relation to some revenue expenses contracts, transaction price is not considered as fair value 
because deposits are interest free. The difference between fair value and transaction price is accumulated in Deferred income 
and amortized over the tenure of security deposit on straight line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Reconciliation of deferred gains/losses yet to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss are as under:

 2.  Foreign Currency Risk
  Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s 
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and Borrowings.
  The Company manages its foreign currency risk through combination of natural hedge, mandatory hedging and hedging 
undertaken on occurence of pre-determined triggers. The hedging is mostly undertaken through forward contracts.
  The Company has outstanding forward contract of H 2,473.89 crore as at March 31, 2023 (March 31, 2022: H 3,610.54 crore) which 
has been undertaken to hedge its exposure to borrowings and other financial liabilities.
  The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD/INR exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, the impact 
on the Company’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including non-designated 
foreign currency derivatives. The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies other than below is 
not material.

  The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results which are offset by changing cost 
competitiveness, lags in market adjustments to movements in rates to its other non-financial assets like inventory etc. For this 
reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the Company’s reported results.
 3.  Commodity Price Risk
  The Company is exposed to various commodity price related risk such as Refinery Margins i.e. Differential between the prices of 
petroleum products & crude oil, Crude Oil Price fluctuation on accounts of inventory valuation fluctuation and crude oil imports, 
etc. As per approved risk management policy, the Company can undertake refinery margin hedging, inventory hedging and 
crude oil price hedging through swaps, options and futures in the OTC market as well as domestic exchanges to mitigate the risk 
within the approved limits.
   The Company’s exposure of various inventories as at the end of the financial year is provided below:
(In MMT)
Inventory March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022
– Raw Materials 9.045 7.0 45
– Stock in Process 1.895 1.765
– Finished Products 5.597 5.048
– Stock in Trade 1.927 1.407
  Due to variation in prices, the Company incurred total inventory gain/ (loss) of H (7,857.90) crore during the current year  
(2022: H 31,007.36 crore).
NOTE – 40: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK FACTORS (Contd..)
The Company’s requirement of crude oil are managed through integrated function handled through its international trade and optimization 
department. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, 
experience and supervision. As per the Company’s policy, derivatives contracts are taken only to hedge the various risks that the Company 
is exposed to and not for speculation purpose.
The Board of Directors oversee the risk management activities for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
A. Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The 
major components of market risk are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and other price risk viz. equity shares etc. 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include Borrowings, Deposits, FVTOCI investments and derivative financial instruments.
 The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.
 The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement 
obligations, provisions, and other non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
 1.   Interest Rate Risk
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows of a 
financial instrument, principally financial debt. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 
primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
  The Company manages to maintain a mix between fixed and floating rates for rupee and foreign currency loans, based on 
liquidity, availability of cost effective instruments and considering the market/regulatory constraints etc. The Company also use 
interest rate swap contracts for managing the interest rate risk of floating interest rate debt. As at March 31, 2023 approximately 
38% of the Company’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2022: 55%).
  As the publication of USD LIBOR benchmark will be phased out by the end of June 2023, the Company has adopted various 
strategies like pre-payment and refinancing of existing instruments during the past couple of years for smooth transitioning 
from USD LIBOR benchmark. For pending loan instruments, the Company has already commenced discussion with the existing 
lenders for transition to alternate reference rate, viz., SOFR. However, the Company is not expecting any material financial impact 
of transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR on its floating rate loans linked to USD LIBOR and associated derivative contracts which 
are maturing beyond 30th June 2023.
   The table below gives information about financial instruments that are to be transited to an alternative benchmark rate 
as at March 31, 2023 :
(J in crore)
Particulars Balances subject to USD LIBOR
1. Non-derivative Financial Assets Nil
2. Non-derivative Financial Liabilities (Foreign Currency Loans) 15,217.56
3. Derivatives (Interest Rate Swap*) 1,643.50
   *Nominal Amount
  The management is likely to complete the transition exercise of the existing USD LIBOR linked instruments before 30th June 
2023.
   The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected, with 
all other variables held constant, on floating rate borrowings is as follows:

  (ii) Hedging activities
   The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
     Commodity Price Risk
   IndianOil buys crude and sells petroleum products linked to international benchmark prices and these benchmark prices do 
not move in tandem. This exposes IndianOil to the risk of variation in refining margins which is managed by margin hedging.
   The risk of fall in refining margins of petroleum products in highly probable forecast sale transactions is hedged by 
undertaking crack spread forward contracts. The Company wants to protect the realization of margins and therefore to 
mitigate this risk, the Company is taking these forward contracts to hedge the margin on highly probable forecast sale 
in future. Risk management activities are undertaken in OTC market i.e. these are the bilateral contracts with registered 
counterparties.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
     Foreign Currency Risk
   The Company is exposed to various foreign currency risks as explained in A.2 above. As per Company’s Foreign Currency & 
Interest Rate Risk Management Policy, the Company is required to fully hedge the short term foreign currency loans (other 
than revolving lines and PCFC loans) and at least 50% of the long term foreign currency loans based on market conditions.
   Apart from mandatory hedging of loans, the Company also undertakes foreign currency forward contracts for the 
management of currency purchase for repayment of crude/product liabilities based on market conditions and requirements. 
The above hedgings are undertaken through delivery based forward contracts.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
     Interest Rate Risk
   The Company is exposed to interest rate risks on floating rate borrowings as explained in A.1 above. Company hedges 
interest rate risk by taking interest rate swaps as per Company’s Interest Rate Risk Management Policy based on market 
conditions. The Company uses interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to interest payments for floating rate borrowings 
denominated in foreign currencies.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
 Hedge Effectiveness
 There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as the terms of the foreign exchange and 
commodity forward contracts match the terms of hedge items. The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging 
relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity forward contracts are identical to the hedged 
risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. In case of interest rate swaps, as the critical 
terms of the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are similar, the Company performs a qualitative 
assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding 
hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.
 Source of Hedge ineffectiveness
 In case of commodity price risk, the Company has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:
 • Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments
 • Different indexes linked to the hedged risk of the hedged items and hedging instruments
 • The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instruments and hedged items 
 • Changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments”
 In case of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, the main source of hedge ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and the 
Company’s own credit risk on the fair value of hedge contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged items. The effect 
of this is not expected to be material.

 4.  Equity Price Risk
  The Company’s investment in listed and non-listed equity securities, other than its investments in Joint Ventures/Associates and 
Subsidiaries, are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities.
  At the reporting date, the exposure to unlisted equity securities at fair value was H982.14 crore. Sensitivity analysis of these 
investments have been provided in Note 39.
  The exposure to listed equity securities valued at fair value was H17,970.96 crore. An increase/decrease of 5% on the NSE market 
index could have an impact of approximately H898.55 crore on the OCI and equity attributable to the Company. These changes 
would not have an effect on profit or loss.
 5.  Derivatives and Hedging
  (i)  Classification of derivatives
   The Company is exposed to certain market risks relating to its ongoing business operations as explained above.
   Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives 
do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.

 Trade Receivables
 Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control relating to 
customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual 
credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments 
to major customers are generally covered by Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees or other forms of credit insurance, wherever required.
 An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large number of 
minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Company applies Simplified 
approach for providing the expected credit losses on Trade Receivables as per the accounting policy of the Company. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in Note 10. The Company 
evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and 
industries and operate in largely independent markets.

 The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is 
the carrying amounts as provided in Note 4, 5, 6, 11 & 12. The Company applies General approach for providing the expected credit 
losses on these items as per the accounting policy of the Company.
 Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s treasury department in accordance with 
the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to 
each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The limits are set to minimise the 
concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
 The Company has given loans to PMUY (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana) customers which are shown under Loans in Note-5. PMUY 
loans are given to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families as per GOI scheme wherein free LPG connections are issued by Oil 
Marketing Companies (OMCs) to the women belonging to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. As per the scheme, OMCs are 
providing an option for interest free loan towards cost of burner and 1st refill to PMUY consumers which is to be recovered from the 
subsidy amount payable to customer when such customers book refill.
 In case of certain PMUY loans, the Company has determined that there is significant increase in the credit risk. The Company considers 
the probability of default upon initial recognition of the loan and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an 
ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. It considers past experience and time elapsed since the last refill for determining 
probability of default on collective basis. The Company has categorized the PMUY loans wherein credit risk has increased significantly 
under various categories considering the likelihood of default based on time gap since last refill. ECL is provided @ 80% (2022: @ 
80%) in case of time gap since last refill is more than 12 months but not exceeding 18 months, @ 90% (2022: @ 90%) in case of time 
gap is more than 18 months but not exceeding 24 months and @ 100% (2022: @100%) for those consumers who have not taken any 
refill more than 24 months. ECL is provided for the loans where the refill is taken within last 12 months based on experience ratio of 
more than 12 months as above. The PMUY loans are classified as credit impaired as on reporting date considering significant financial 
difficulty in case the customer has not taken any refill from past 24 months (2022: 24 months).
 In case of other financial assets, there are certain credit impaired cases mainly due to breach of contract arising due to default or 
bankruptcy proceedings.
 The movement in the loss allowance for impairment of financial assets at amortised cost during the year was as follows:

D.  Excessive risk concentration
 Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographical 
region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Company’s performance to developments 
affecting a particular industry.
 In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, the Company’s policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on the 
maintenance of a diversified portfolio. Identified concentrations of credit risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
E. Collateral
 As Company has been rated investment grade by various domestic and international rating agencies, there has been no requirement of 
submitting any collateral for booking of derivative contracts. Company undertakes derivatives contract only with those counterparties 
that have credit rating above the internally approved threshold rating. Accordingly, Company does not seek any collaterals from its 
counterparties.
NOTE–41: CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the company’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. Capital includes issued equity capital, 
share premium and all other equity reserves, attributable to the equity shareholders, for the purpose of the Company’s capital management.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and requirements. The 
Company determines the capital requirement based on annual operating plans and long-term and other strategic investment plans. The 
Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure. The Company monitors capital using debt equity ratio, which is borrowings divided by Equity. The Company’s endeavour 
is to keep the debt equity ratio around 1:1.

5 During certain periods of Financial Year 2019-20, retail selling prices of domestic LPG cylinders were lower than desired rates, 
resulting in reduced sales realisation. This difference in realisation relating to DBTL customers amounting to H305.40 crore was 
claimed from Government of India, along with subsidy under PAHAL (DBTL) Scheme 2014. As the claim has not yet been approved, 
the company has derecognised the same during Financial Year 2022-23 and shown under “Net Loss on de-recognition of Financial 
Assets at Amortised Cost.

NOTE–49: OTHER DISCLOSURES
1 In order to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families, Government has approved “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)” scheme 
where free LPG connections are issued by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to the women belonging to the Below Poverty Line 
(BPL) households as per SECC -2011 (Rural) database. The scheme was launched on May 1, 2016. As per the scheme, the initial 
cost towards connection charges (Refundable deposit) would be borne by the Central Government for each card holder. Few State 
Governments have also extended this scheme to other beneficiaries. As per the scheme, OMCs would provide an option for EMI/
Loans towards cost of burner and 1st refill to the PMUY consumers. The loan amount is to be recovered from the subsidy amount 
payable by the government to the customers on each refill sale. During the year, discounting of the loan has been done based on 
assumption of average refills in a year and average subsidy rate per cylinder under respective range of subsidy buckets.
 The amount of outstanding as at March 31, 2023 towards PMUY claim from Central Government is H 46.30 crore (2022: H 8.63 crore) 
and loan to PMUY consumers is H 2,567.27 crore (2022: H 2,770.67 crore) (net of recovery through subsidy). Against the above loan, 
a provision for doubtful loans amounting to H 766.38 crore (2022: H 601.46 crore) has been created as at March 31, 2023 against 
the beneficiaries who have not taken any refill for more than 12 months based on expected credit loss(ECL) model and applying 
experience factor based on experience ratio of doubtful provision on more than 12 months to the loans in less than 12 month category. 
(Also refer Credit Risk under Note 40)
 The Company has remeasured the gross carrying amount of PMUY loan as at Balance Sheet date based on revised estimated 
future contractual cash flows resulting in reduction in PMUY loans by H 41.51 crore (2022: H 489.00 crore) which has been charged to 
Statement of Profit and Loss in Note - 29.1 under the head  "Amortisation and Remeasurement of PMUY Assets” .
2 Pursuant to the Board approval for formation of a Joint Venture company between Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and Coal India Ltd for 
transfer of explosives business to the said venture Company on slump sale basis at a value of H 311.00 crore (Net Assets WDV of  
H 132.00 crore as at March 31, 2022), consent of Niti Ayog was initially received for formation of the JV vide letter dated April 27, 2018. 
However, the formation of the JV is not carried forward on account of subsequent communication dated July 11, 2018 from MoPNG. 
The matter is under deliberation and accordingly, the explosive business continues to be in operation as at March 31, 2023. The Net 
Asset WDV of the business as at March 31, 2023 is H 79.70 crore.
3 During the FY 2022-23, the Company has recognised an arbitration award in its favour in a case between the Company & Nayara 
Energy Limited (“NEL” , formerly known as Essar Oil Ltd.). NEL has paid Take or Pay (“ToP”) liability amounting to H288.62 crore and 
interest thereon amounting to H483.81 crore. Additionally, the Company had already encashed bank guarantee amounting to H186.00 
crore. As per the award NEL has make-up gas right for ToP payments and accordingly H474.62 crore has been accounted for as 
“Advance from Customers” under Current Non- Financial liability. The Company has accounted H483.81 crore under the head interest 
income.
4 During the FY 2022-23, the Company was not able to utilise the committed capacity booked for calendar year 2022 as per regasification 
agreement dated January 29, 2014 with Petronet LNG Limited (PLL). Hence, PLL has raised invoice for such unused capacity as 
“Pay for, if not used obligation” amounting to H 227.08 crore for Contract Year 2022 as per terms and conditions of the Contract. The 
Company has provided for such regasification charges under the head miscellaneous expenses in Note-29.1.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To
The Members of Indian Oil Corporation Limited
Report on the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the 
carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. 
These include the decision to capitalise or expense costs; the 
annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalisation 
of assets and the use of management assumptions and 
estimates for the determination or the measurement and 
recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due 
to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of 
the Company and the level of judgement and estimates 
required, we consider this to be as area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the 
appropriateness of capitalisation process, performed tests of details on 
costs capitalised, the timeliness of the capitalisation of the assets and the 
de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use.
In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made 
by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalised; 
determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the 
appropriateness of assets lives applied in the calculation of depreciation; 
the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful 
lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. 
We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid 
judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the 
Holding Company”) and its Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the Group”), its Joint Ventures and Associates, which comprise of 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that 
date, and notes to the consolidated financial statements including, a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of other 
auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as referred to in 
the “Other Matter” Paragraphs 2 and 3, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of 
the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its Joint Ventures and Associates as at March 31, 2023, and its consolidated profit including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its Joint Ventures and Associates in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), together with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred into paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Other Matters paragraphs below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters 
described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Provision for Direct Taxes
The Company has uncertain direct tax positions including 
matters under dispute which involves significant judgment 
relating to the possible outcome of these disputes in 
estimation of the provision for income tax. Because of the 
judgement required, this area is considered as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures involved assessment of the management’s underlying 
assumptions in estimating the tax provision and the possible outcome of 
the disputes taking into account the legal precedence, jurisprudence and 
other rulings in evaluating management’s position on these uncertain 
direct tax positions. We have also assessed the disclosures made by the 
company in this regard in consolidated financial statements.
Provisions and Contingent Liabilities
The Company is involved in various taxes and other 
disputes for which final outcome cannot be easily predicted 
and which could potentially result in significant liabilities. 
The assessment of the risks associated with the litigations 
is based on complex assumptions, which require the use 
of judgement and such judgement relates, primarily, to the 
assessment of the uncertainties connected to the prediction 
of the outcome of the proceedings and to the adequacy 
of the disclosures in the standalone financial statements. 
Because of the judgement required, the materiality of such 
litigations and the complexity of the assessment process, 
this area is considered as a key audit matter
Our audit procedures in response to this Key Audit Matter included, 
among others,
• Assessment of the process and relevant controls implemented 
to identify legal and tax litigations and pending administrative 
proceedings.
• Assessment of assumptions used in the evaluation of potential 
legal and tax risks performed by the legal and tax department of 
the Company considering the legal precedence and other rulings in 
similar cases.
• Inquiry with the legal and tax departments regarding the status of 
the most significant disputes and inspection of the key relevant 
documentation.
• Analysis of opinion received from the experts wherever available.
• Review of the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures and 
Associates
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
which are valued at cost have been adjusted for impairment 
losses in line with “Ind AS 36 Impairment of assets” . In case 
there is an indication of possible impairment, the Company 
carries out an impairment test by comparing the recoverable 
amount of the investments determined according to 
the value in use method and their carrying amount. The 
valuation process adopted by management is complex and 
is based on a series of assumptions, such as the forecast 
cash flows, the appropriate discounting rate and the growth 
rate. These assumptions are, by nature, influenced by future 
expectations regarding the evolution of external market.
Since judgement of the management is required to determine 
whether there is indication of possible impairment and 
considering the subjectivity of the estimates relating to the 
determination of the cash flows and the key assumptions of 
the impairment test, the area is considered as a key audit 
matter.
With reference to this key audit matter, we considered the following:
• Book value of the investments in subsidiaries, joint venture and 
associates as compared to the carrying amount.
• Market capitalization in case of listed entities in which investments 
have been made.
• Some of the entities are still in the construction stage and have not 
begun commercial operations.
Based on the information and explanations obtained as above, we 
concluded that the Management’s judgement regarding indication of 
impairment in certain investments during the year is appropriate. Where 
there is indication of impairment, we examined the approach taken by 
management to determine the value of the investments, analysed the 
methods and assumptions applied by management to carry out the 
impairment test and the reports obtained from the experts in valuation.
The following audit procedures were adopted:
• identification and understanding of the significant controls 
implemented by the Company over the impairment testing process; 
analysis of the reasonableness of the principal assumptions made 
to estimate their cash flows and obtaining other information from 
management that we deemed to be significant.
• analysis of actual data of the year and previous years in comparison 
with the original plan, in order to assess the nature of variances and 
the reliability of the planning process.
• assessment of the reasonableness of the discount rate and growth 
rate.
• Verification of the mathematical accuracy of the model used to 
determine the value in use of the investments.
We also examined the adequacy of the information provided by the 
Company about the impairment test and its consistency with the 
requirements of Ind AS 36.

The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises 
the information included in the Financial Performance highlights, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Management 
Discussions and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Report on Corporate Governance, Shareholders Information 
and other information in Integrated Annual Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and identified 
above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the auditor otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
If, based on the work we have performed, and report of the other auditors as furnished to us (refer paragraphs 2 and 3 of other matter para 
below), we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report in this regard.
When we read the remaining other information, which we will obtain after the date of auditors’ report and if we conclude that there is 
material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in 
term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance, 
total comprehensive income, consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the Group, its 
Joint Ventures and Associates in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting 
Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, of its Joint Ventures and Associates are responsible for 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group, 
its Joint Ventures and Associates for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance 
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, its Joint 
Ventures and Associates are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group, its Joint Ventures and Associates to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, its Joint Ventures, and Associates, are responsible for overseeing 
the financial reporting process of the Group, its Joint Ventures and Associates.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Group, its 
Joint Ventures and Associates which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group, its Joint Ventures, and Associates to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group, its Joint Ventures and Associates controlled entities to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group, 
its Joint Ventures, and Associates to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision, and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements 
of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been 
audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried 
out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated 
financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our Auditors’ Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure 1 to the Independent Auditors’ Report
On the Consolidated Financial Statements of even date to the Members of Indian Oil Corporation Limited for 
the year ended March 31, 2023
(Referred to in paragraph 1 (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2023, we 
have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred 
to as “Holding Company”) and its subsidiary companies (collectively referred to as “the Group”) joint ventures and associates, which are 
companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, joint ventures and associates which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control with 
reference to financial statements criteria established by the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates which are 
companies incorporated in India, considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ the ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation 
of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company, 
its subsidiary companies, joint ventures, and associates which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and audit evidence obtained by other auditors in term of their reports is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures and associates, which are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control with reference to financial statement includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion 
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, joint ventures and associates which are incorporated in India, have, in 
all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements reporting and such internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023 , based on the internal control over financial 
reporting criteria established by the Group considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit 
of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matter
Our aforesaid reports under section 143(3) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial control with 
reference to financial statements insofar as it relates to 1 subsidiary, 20 joint ventures and associates which are companies incorporated 
in India, is based on the corresponding standalone/consolidated reports of the auditors, as applicable, of such companies incorporated 
in India.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2023
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
I. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Financial Statements comprise Financial Statements of 
“Indian Oil Corporation Limited” (“the Holding company” or “IOCL” 
or “Parent Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) 
for the year ended March 31, 2023.
IOCL is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled 
in India. Its shares are listed on Bombay Stock Exchange and 
National Stock Exchange in India. The registered office of the 
Holding company is located at Indian Oil Bhavan, G-9, Ali Yavar 
Jung Marg, Bandra (East), Mumbai.
The Group has business interests straddling the entire hydrocarbon 
value chain - from refining, pipeline transportation & marketing, 
to exploration & production of crude oil & gas, petrochemicals, 
gas marketing, alternative energy sources and globalisation of 
downstream operations.
The Financial Statements have been approved for issue in 
accordance with a resolution of the Board of directors passed in 
its meeting held on May 16, 2023.
II. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1.  Basis of Preparation/Consolidation and Statement of 
Compliance
1.1  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) read with the Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules and other relevant provisions of the Act and 
Rules thereunder, as amended from time to time.
1.2  The financial statements have been prepared on a historical 
cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities which 
have been measured at fair value:
 – Derivative financial instruments,
 – Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value (refer serial no. 17 of accounting policies regarding 
financial instruments) and
 – Plan assets related to employee benefits (refer serial no. 
12 of accounting policies regarding employee benefits)
1.3  The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (₹) 
which is the presentation currency of the Group and all values 
are rounded to the nearest crore (up to two decimals) except 
when otherwise indicated.
1.4  Basis of Consolidation:
1.4.1 Subsidiaries:
 The financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of the IOCL and its subsidiaries as at March 31, 2023. Control 
is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if 
and only if it has:
 – Power over the investee
 _ Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee, and
 _ The ability to use its power over the investee to affect 
its returns
 The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an 
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three elements of control 
listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the Financial Statements 
from the date the Group gains control until the date the 
Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
 Financial Statements are prepared using uniform 
accounting policies for like transactions and other events 
in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses 
accounting policies other than those adopted in the 
Financial Statements for like transactions and events in 
similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to 
that group member’s financial statements in preparing the 
Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure conformity 
with the group’s accounting policies.
 The Financial Statements of all entities used for the purpose 
of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as 
that of the parent company, i.e., year ended on March 31. 
Following consolidation procedure is followed:
 (a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cash flows of the parent company with 
those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income 
and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the 
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognized in the 
consolidated financial statements at the acquisition 
date.
 (b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investment in each subsidiary and the 
parent company’s portion of equity of each subsidiary. 
Business combinations policy explains how to account 
for any related goodwill.
 (c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between entities of the group (profits 
or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that 
are recognized in assets, such as inventory and fixed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the 
consolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income 
Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from 
the elimination of profits and losses resulting from 
intragroup transactions.
 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive 
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent company of the Group and to the non-controlling 
interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to 
bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s 
accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated 
in full on consolidation.
 Change in the Group’s ownership interests in existing 
subsidiaries
 A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without 
a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If 
the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
 – De-recognizes the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the subsidiary
 – De-recognizes the carrying amount of any non-
controlling interests
 – De-recognizes the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity
 – Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received
 – Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained
 – Recognizes any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
 – Reclassifies the parent company’s share of 
components previously recognized in OCI to profit 
or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would 
be required if the Group had directly disposed of the 
related assets or liabilities
1.4.2 Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures
 An associate is an entity over which the Group has 
significant influence. Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions 
of the investee but is not control or joint control over those 
policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using 
the equity method of accounting.
 A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint 
control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing control.
 The considerations made in determining whether significant 
influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to 
determine control over the subsidiaries.
 The Group’s investments in its associate and joint venture 
are accounted for using the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint 
venture is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount 
of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture 
since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate 
or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment individually.
 The Statement of Profit and Loss reflects the Group’s share 
of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. 
Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of 
the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change 
recognized directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when 
applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to 
the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
 If an entity’s share of losses of an associate or a joint venture 
equal or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture 
(which includes any long term interest that, in substance, 
form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate or 
joint venture), the entity discontinues recognizing its share 
of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only to 
the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or 
joint venture. If the associate or joint venture subsequently 
reports profits, the entity resumes recognizing its share of 
those profits only after its share of the profits equals the 
share of losses not recognized.
 The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an 
associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
 After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognize an 
impairment loss on its investments in its associate or joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the investment in 
the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then 
recognizes the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate and a 
joint venture’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
 Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint 
control over the joint venture, the Group measures and 
recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of the associate 
or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint 
control and the fair value of the retained investment and 
proceeds from disposal is recognized in profit or loss.
1.4.3 Interest in Joint operations:
 For the interest in joint operations, the Group recognizes:
 – Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly
 – Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred 
jointly
 – Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising 
from the joint operation
 – Share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the 
joint operation
 – Expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred 
jointly

and accumulated impairment losses (if any), except freehold 
land which are carried at historical cost. The cost of an item 
of PPE comprises its purchase price/construction cost 
including applicable taxes (net of credits) after deducting 
any discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs 
of bringing the assets to its working condition and location 
for its intended use and present value of any estimated 
cost of dismantling and removing the item and restoring 
the site on which it is located. These costs are capitalized 
until the asset is ready for use and includes borrowing cost 
capitalized in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy.
2.1.2 The cost of an item of PPE is recognized as an asset if, and 
only if:
 (a) it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the entity; and
 (b) the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
 In accordance with the above criteria, subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a 
separate asset, as appropriate.
2.1.3 Technical know-how / license fee relating to plants/facilities 
and specific software that are integral part of the related 
hardware are capitalized as part of cost of the underlying asset.
2.1.4 Spare parts are capitalized when they meet the definition of 
PPE, i.e., when the Group intends to use these for a period 
exceeding 12 months.
2.1.5 The acquisition of some items of PPE although not directly 
increasing the future economic benefits of any particular 
existing item of PPE, may be necessary for the Company to 
obtain the future economic benefits from its other assets. 
Such items of PPE are recognized as assets.
2.1.6 Environment responsibility related obligations directly 
attributable to projects is recognized as project cost on 
the basis of progress of project or on actual incurrence, 
whichever is higher.
2.1.7 On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to continue 
with the carrying value of all of its PPE recognized as at 
April 1, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP and use 
that carrying value as the deemed cost of the property, 
plant and equipment.
2.2 Capital Work in Progress (CWIP)
A. Construction Period Expenses
2.2.1 Revenue expenses exclusively attributable to projects 
incurred during construction period are capitalized. 
However, such expenses in respect of capital facilities 
being executed along with the production/operations 
simultaneously and where the expenses are not attributable 
exclusively are charged to revenue.
2.2.2 Borrowing cost incurred during construction period on loans 
specifically borrowed and utilized for projects is capitalized 
on quarterly basis up to the date of capitalization.
2.2.3 Borrowing cost, if any, incurred on General Borrowings used 
for projects is capitalized at the weighted average cost. The 
amount of such borrowings is determined on quarterly 
basis after setting off the amount of internal accruals.
B. Capital Stores
2.2.4 Capital Stores are valued at weighted average cost. Specific 
provision is made for likely diminution in value, wherever 
required.
2.3 Intangible Assets & Amortisation
2.3.1 Technical know-how/license fee relating to production 
process and process design are recognized as Intangible 
Assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the underlying plant/facility.
2.3.2 Expenditure incurred in research phase is charged to 
revenue and that in development phase, unless it is of 
capital nature, is also charged to revenue.
2.3.3 Cost incurred on computer software/licenses purchased/
developed resulting in future economic benefits, other 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
than specific software that are integral part of the 
related hardware, are capitalized as Intangible Asset and 
amortised over a period of three years beginning from the 
month in which such software/licenses are capitalized. 
However, where such computer software/license is under 
development or is not yet ready for use, accumulated cost 
incurred on such items are accounted as “Intangible Assets 
Under Development”
2.3.4 Right of ways with indefinite useful lives are not amortised 
but tested for impairment annually at the cash-generating 
unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues 
to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
2.3.5 Intangible Assets acquired separately are measured on 
initial recognition at cost. The cost of Intangible Assets 
acquired in a business combination is based on its fair 
value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
Intangible Assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. In case 
of internally generated intangibles, development cost is 
recognized as an asset when all the recognition criteria 
are met. However, all other internally generated intangibles 
including research cost are not capitalized and the related 
expenditure is recognized in the statement of profit and loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
2.3.6 The useful lives of Intangible Assets are assessed as either 
finite or indefinite. Intangible Assets with finite lives are 
amortised over the useful life on straight line basis and 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication 
that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset 
with a finite useful life are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or 
the expected pattern of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify 
the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and 
are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on Intangible Assets with finite lives 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another 
asset.
2.3.7 On transition to Ind AS, the Group has elected to continue 
with the carrying value of all of its Intangible Assets 
recognized as at April 1, 2015 measured as per the previous 
GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed cost of 
the Intangible Assets.
2.3.8 Amortisation is charged pro-rata on monthly basis on 
assets, from/upto the month of capitalization/sale, disposal/
or classified to Asset held for disposal.
2.4 Depreciation
2.4.1 Cost of PPE (net of residual value) excluding freehold land 
is depreciated on straight-line method as per the useful life 
prescribed in Schedule II to the Act except in case of the 
following assets:
 a) Useful life based on technical assessment
  • 15 years for Plant and Equipment relating to 
Retail Outlets (other than storage tanks and 
related equipment), LPG cylinders and pressure 
regulators
  • 25 years for solar power plant
  • Certain assets of R&D Centre (15-25 years)
  • Certain assets of CGD business, (Compressor/
Booster Compressor and Dispenser - 10 years, 
Cascade – 20 years)
  • Moulds used for the manufacturing of the 
packaging material for Lubricants-5 years
  • In other cases, like Spare Parts etc. (2-30 years)
 b) In case of specific agreements e.g., enabling assets 
etc., useful life as per agreement or Schedule II to the 
Act, whichever is lower.
 c) In case of immovable assets constructed on leasehold 
land, useful life as per Schedule-II to the Act or lease 
period of land (including renewable/likely renewable 
period), whichever is lower and
 d) In case where useful life is mandated as per other 
relevant statute or any of the regulation.
 Depreciation is charged pro-rata on monthly basis on 
assets, from/up to the month of capitalization/sale, 
disposal/or classified to Asset held for disposal.
 Residual value is determined considering past experience 
and generally the same is between 0% to 5% of cost of 
assets except
 a. In case of Steel LPG cylinder and pressure regulator, 
residual value is considered maximum at 25% and in 
case of fibre composite LPG cylinder, residual value is 
considered at 10% based on estimated realisable value
 b. In case of catalyst with noble metal content, residual 
value is considered based on the cost of metal content 
and
 c. In few cases residual value is considered based on 
transfer value agreed in respective agreement.
 The Group depreciates components of the main asset 
that are significant in value and have different useful lives

NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
as compared to the main asset separately. The Group 
depreciates spares over the life of the spare from the date it 
is available for use.
2.4.2 PPE, other than LPG Cylinders and Pressure Regulators, 
costing up to ₹ 5,000/- per item are depreciated fully in 
the year of capitalization. Further, spares, components like 
catalyst excluding noble metal content and major overhaul/ 
inspection are also depreciated fully over their respective 
useful life.
2.4.3 The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation 
of PPE are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
2.5 Derecognition
2.5.1 PPE and Intangible Assets are derecognized upon disposal 
or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset or disposal. Any gain or 
loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE 
or Intangible Asset is determined as the difference between 
the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3. Leases
 The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
3.1 Leases as Lessee (Assets taken on lease)
 The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets. The Group recognizes lease liabilities to 
make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing 
the right to use the underlying assets.
3.1.1 Lease Liabilities
 At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including in substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise 
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a 
lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the 
option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do 
not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense 
in the period on which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.
 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is 
not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the 
amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion 
of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.
 The Group accounts for each lease component within the 
contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of 
the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract 
to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-
alone price of the lease component and the aggregate 
stand-alone price of the non-lease components, except 
for leases where the company has elected to use practical 
expedient not to separate non-lease payments from the 
calculation of the lease liability and ROU asset where the 
entire consideration is treated as lease component.
3.1.2 Right-of-use Assets
 The Group recognizes right-of-use (ROU) assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date 
the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use 
assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, 
initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain 
ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, 
the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful 
life and the lease term. Right-of use assets are subject to 
impairment. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects 
the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated 
using the estimated useful life of the asset as per 2.4 above. 
Perpetual Right of use (ROU) assets related to land are not 
depreciated but tested for Impairment loss, if any.
3.1.3 Modifications to a lease agreement beyond the original 
terms and conditions are generally accounted for as a re-
measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding 
adjustment to the ROU asset. Any gain or loss on 
modification is recognized in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. However, the modifications that increase the scope of 
the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying 
assets at a price commensurate with the stand-alone 
selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease. 
In case of lease modifications, discounting rates used for 
measurement of lease liability and ROU assets is also 
suitably adjusted.
3.1.4 Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
 The Group applies the short-term lease recognition 
exemption to its short-term leases of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 
months or less from the commencement date and do not 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of 
low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are 
considered of low value and is not intended for sublease. 
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term or another systematic basis if that 
basis is more representative of the pattern of the lessee’s 
benefit.
3.2 Leases as Lessor (assets given on lease)
3.2.1 When the Group acts as lessor, it determines at the 
commencement of the lease whether it is a finance lease or 
an operating lease.
3.2.2 Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except 
where another systematic basis is more representative of 
the time pattern of the benefit derived from the asset given 
on lease.
3.2.3 All assets given on finance lease are shown as receivables 
at an amount equal to net investment in the lease. Principal 
component of the lease receipts is adjusted against 
outstanding receivables and interest income is accounted 
by applying the interest rate implicit in the lease to the net 
investment. If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease 
components, the Company applies principles enunciated in 
Ind AS 115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to 
allocate the consideration in the contract.
3.2.4 When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for 
its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. 
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with 
reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease, not 
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a 
short-term lease to which the Company applies the short-
term lease exemption described above, then it classifies the 
sub-lease as an operating lease.
4.  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets (Also Refer Para 14 
for Impairment of E&P Assets)
 The Group assesses at each reporting date, whether there is 
an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is 
required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or 
cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less cost of disposal 
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for 
an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets 
or groups of assets.
 Impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of 
an asset exceeds recoverable amount.
 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions are 
taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations 
are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other available fair value 
indicators.
 The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets 
and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for 
each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are 
allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally 
cover a period of 15 years. For longer periods, a long-term 
growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash 
flows after the fifteenth year. To estimate cash flow projections 
beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, 
Group extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a 
steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an 
increasing rate can be justified.
 For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that 
previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates 
the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously 
recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has 
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the 
asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss 
was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognized for the asset in prior years.
5. Borrowing Costs
 Borrowing cost consists of interest and other cost incurred in 
connection with the borrowing of funds.
 Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition or 
construction of the qualifying asset are capitalized as part 
of the cost of such asset. A qualifying asset is one that 
necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for 
intended use. Capitalization of borrowing costs is suspended 
when active development activity on the qualifying assets is 
interrupted other than on temporary basis and charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss during such extended periods. 
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the period in which the same are incurred.
6. Foreign Currency Transactions/Translation
6.1  The Group’s financial statements are presented in Indian 
Rupee (₹) which is also functional currency of the Holding 
Company.
6.2  Transactions in currencies other than the respective group 
entities’ functional currencies (foreign currencies) are initially 
Financial StatementsStatutory ReportsCorporate Overview  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Indian Oil Corporation Limited
346 347
Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition Notes to Financial Statements
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
recorded at spot exchange rates prevailing on the date of 
transactions.
6.3  Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies (such as 
cash, receivables, payables etc.) outstanding at the end of 
reporting period, are translated at exchange rates prevailing 
on that date.
6.4  Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency, 
(such as PPE, intangible assets, equity investments, capital/ 
revenue advances other than expected to be settled in cash 
etc.) are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of the transaction, other than those measured at fair value.
 Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date 
when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on 
translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the 
change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences 
on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) or the Statement of Profit and 
Loss are also recognized in OCI or the Statement of Profit and 
Loss, respectively).
6.5  Any gains or losses arising due to differences in exchange 
rates at the time of translation or settlement are accounted 
for in the Statement of Profit and Loss either under the head 
foreign exchange fluctuation or interest cost to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to borrowing costs as the case 
may be, except those relating to loans mentioned below.
 Exchange differences on long-term foreign currency loans 
obtained or re-financed on or before March 31, 2016, relating 
to acquisition of depreciable assets are adjusted to the 
carrying cost of the assets and depreciated over the balance 
life of the assets.
6.6  Exchange differences arising on monetary items that forms 
part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign 
operation are recognized in profit or loss in the separate 
financial statements of the reporting entity or the individual 
financial statements of the foreign operation, as appropriate. In 
the financial statements that include the foreign operation and 
the reporting entity (e.g., consolidated financial statements 
when the foreign operation is a subsidiary), such exchange 
differences are recognized initially in OCI. These exchange 
differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on 
disposal of the net investment.
 On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
are translated into INR at the rate of exchange prevailing at 
the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses an average 
rate to translate income and expense items, if the average 
rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the 
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation 
for consolidation are recognized in OCI. On disposal of a foreign 
operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular 
foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.
 Any goodwill arising in the acquisition/business combination 
of a foreign operation on or after April 1, 2013, and any fair 
value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot 
rate of exchange at the reporting date.
 Any goodwill or fair value adjustments arising in business 
combinations/acquisitions, which occurred before the April 
1, 2013, are treated as assets and liabilities of the entity 
rather than as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. 
Therefore, those assets and liabilities are non-monetary items 
already expressed in the functional currency of the parent 
company and no further translation differences occur.
7. Inventories
7.1 Raw Materials & Stock-in-Process
7.1.1 Raw materials including crude oil are valued at cost 
determined on weighted average basis or net realisable 
value, whichever is lower.
7.1.2 Stock in Process is valued at raw material cost plus 
processing cost as applicable or net realisable value, 
whichever is lower.
7.1.3 Crude oil in Transit is valued at cost or net realisable value, 
whichever is lower.
7.1.4 Initial cost of inventories includes the transfer of gains and 
losses on qualifying cash flow hedges, recognized in OCI, 
in respect of the purchases of raw materials.
7.2 Finished Products and Stock-in-Trade
7.2.1 Finished Products and Stock in Trade, other than lubricants, 
are valued at cost determined on ‘First in First Out’ basis or 
net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of Finished 
Products produced internally is determined based on raw 
material cost and processing cost.
7.2.2 Lubricants are valued at cost on weighted average basis or 
net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of lubricants 
internally produced is determined based on cost of inputs 
and processing cost.
7.2.3 Imported products in transit are valued at cost or net 
realisable value whichever is lower.
7.3 Stores and Spares
7.3.1 Stores and Spares (including Chemicals. packing 
Containers i.e., empty barrels, tins etc.) are valued at 
weighted average cost. Specific provision is made in respect 
of identified obsolete stores & spares and chemicals for 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
likely diminution in value. Further, a provision @ 5% of cost 
is also made on the balance stores and spares (excluding 
barrels, tins, stores in transit, chemicals/catalysts, crude oil 
and own products) towards likely diminution in the value.
7.3.2 Stores and Spares in transit are valued at cost.
8.  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets
8.1 Provisions
8.1.1 Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation.
8.1.2 When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be 
recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized 
as a separate asset but only when it is virtually certain, 
and amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. 
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss net of reimbursement, if any.
8.1.3 If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions 
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due 
to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.
8.1.4 Decommissioning Liability
 Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value 
of expected cost to settle the obligation using estimated 
cash flows and are recognized as part of the cost of the 
particular asset. The cash flows are discounted at a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the 
decommissioning liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
expensed as incurred and recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss as a finance cost. The estimated future cost 
of decommissioning is reviewed annually and adjusted as 
appropriate. Changes in the estimated future cost or in the 
discount rate applied are adjusted in the cost of the asset.
8.2 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
8.2.1 Show-cause notices issued by various Government 
Authorities are generally not considered as obligations.
8.2.2 When the demand notices are raised against such show 
cause notices and are disputed by the Group, these are 
classified as disputed obligations.
8.2.3 The treatment in respect of disputed obligations is as under:
 a) a provision is recognized in respect of present 
obligations where the outflow of resources is probable 
as per 8.1.1 above.
 b) all other cases are disclosed as contingent liabilities 
unless the possibility of outflow of resources is remote.
8.2.4 Contingent Liabilities are possible obligations that arise from 
past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future 
events not wholly within the control of the Company. Where 
it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the 
obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent 
liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the 
management/independent experts and reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date to reflect the current management 
estimate.
8.2.5 Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed 
towards capital expenditure are considered for disclosure.
8.2.6 A Contingent Asset is disclosed where an inflow of 
economic benefits is probable.
9. Revenue
9.1 Revenue From Contracts With Customers
9.1.1 The Group is in the business of oil and gas operations, 
and it earns revenue primarily from sale of petroleum and 
petrochemical products. In addition, the Group also earns 
revenue from other businesses which comprises Gas, 
Exploration & Production and Others.
 Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects 
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified 
in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties.
 The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal 
in its revenue arrangements, except a few agency services, 
because it typically controls the goods or services before 
transferring them to the customer.
 The Group considers whether there are other promises 
in the contract that are separate performance obligations 
to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be 
allocated (e.g., customer loyalty points). In determining 
the transaction price for the sale of products, the Group 
considers the effects of variable consideration, the 
existence of significant financing components, non-cash 
consideration and consideration payable to the customer (if 
any).
9.1.2 Revenue from the sale of petroleum products, petrochemical 
products, Crude and gas are recognized at a point in 
time, generally upon delivery of the products. The Group 
recognizes revenue over time using input method (on the 
basis of time elapsed) in case of non-refundable deposits 
Financial StatementsStatutory ReportsCorporate Overview  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23Indian Oil Corporation Limited
348 349
Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition Notes to Financial Statements
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
from dealers and service contracts. In case of construction 
contracts, revenue and cost are recognized by measuring 
the contract progress using input method by comparing the 
cost incurred and total contract cost. Contract modifications 
are accounted for as a part of existing contract or separate 
contract based on conditions prescribed in Ind AS 115.
9.1.3 The Company has assumed that recovery of excise duty 
flows to the Company on its own account. This is for the 
reason that it is a liability of the manufacturer which forms 
part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the 
goods are sold or not. Since the recovery of excise duty 
flows to the Company on its own account, revenue includes 
excise duty.
 However, Sales Tax/Goods and Services Tax (GST) and 
Value Added Tax (VAT) is not received by the company on 
its own account. Rather, it is tax collected on value added 
to the product by the seller on behalf of the government. 
Accordingly, it is excluded from revenue.
9.1.4 Variable consideration
 If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, 
the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which 
it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods 
to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated 
at contract inception and constrained until it is highly 
probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount 
of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the 
associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is 
subsequently resolved.
 The Group provides volume rebates to certain customers 
once the quantity of products purchased during the period 
exceeds a threshold specified in the contract. Rebates 
are offset against amounts payable by the customer. 
The volume rebates/ cash discount give rise to variable 
consideration. To estimate the variable consideration for 
the expected future rebates/ cash discount, the Group 
applies the most likely amount method for contracts with 
a single-volume threshold and the expected value method 
for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The 
selected method that best predicts the amount of variable 
consideration is primarily driven by the number of volume 
thresholds contained in the contract and accordingly, the 
Group recognizes a refund liability for the expected future 
rebates.
9.1.5 Loyalty Points
 The Group operates various loyalty point schemes. The 
transaction price allocated to customer loyalty points is 
based on their relative estimated standalone selling price 
and the same is reduced from revenue from sale of goods. 
While estimating standalone selling price of customer 
loyalty points, the likelihood of exercising the option is 
adjusted. Wherever the Group is acting as an agent in this 
arrangement, the Company recognize the revenue on net 
basis.
9.2  Other claims are recognized when there is a reasonable 
certainty of recovery.
10. Excise Duty
 Excise duty is accounted on the basis of both, payments made 
in respect of goods cleared as also provision made for goods 
lying in stock. Value of stock includes excise duty payable/ 
paid on finished goods wherever applicable.
11. Taxes on Income
11.1 Current Income Tax
 The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the current tax 
amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates 
and generates taxable income.
 Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities.
 Current income tax relating to items recognized outside 
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in 
other comprehensive income or in equity). Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with 
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate.
11.2  Deferred Tax
11.2.1 Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet method 
on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
 Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
 (a) when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
 (b) in respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available in future against which the deductible 
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
 (a) when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit or 
loss nor taxable profit or loss.
 (b) In respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable 
future and taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilized.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
11.2.2 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available 
in future to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be 
utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed 
at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that 
it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow 
the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
11.2.3 Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside profit 
or loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity).
11.2.4 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a 
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to 
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
12. Employee Benefits
12.1 Short Term Benefits:
 Short Term Employee Benefits are accounted for in the 
period during which the services have been rendered.
12.2  Post-Employment Benefits and Other Long Term 
Employee Benefits:
 a) The Group’s contribution to the Provident Fund is 
remitted to separate trusts established for this purpose 
based on a fixed percentage of the eligible employee’s 
salary and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss/
CWIP. Shortfall, if any, in the fund assets, based on the 
Government specified minimum rate of return, is made 
good by the Group and charged to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss/CWIP.
 b) The Group operates defined benefit plans for Gratuity, 
Post-Retirement Medical Benefits, Resettlement, 
Felicitation Scheme and Ex-gratia. The cost of providing 
such defined benefits is determined using the projected 
unit credit method of actuarial valuation made at the 
end of the year. Out of these plans, Gratuity and Post-
Retirement Medical Benefits are administered through 
respective Trusts.
 c) Obligations on other long-term employee benefits 
viz Leave Encashment and Long Service Awards are 
provided using the projected unit credit method of 
actuarial valuation made at the end of the year. Out of 
these obligations, leave encashment obligations are 
funded through qualifying insurance policies made with 
insurance companies.
 d) The Group also operates a defined contribution 
scheme for Pension benefits for its employees and the 
contribution is remitted to a separate Trust/Corporate 
NPS.
12.3 Termination Benefits:
 Payments made under Voluntary Retirement Scheme are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on incurrence.
12.4 Remeasurements:
 Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding amounts included in 
net interest on the net defined benefit liability) and the return 
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on 
the net defined benefit liability), are recognized immediately 
in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit 
to retained earnings through Other Comprehensive Income 
(OCI) in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurements 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Remeasurements in respect of other long term benefits are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss on the earlier 
of:
 • The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
 • The date that the Group recognizes related restructuring 
cost
 Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognizes the 
following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an 
expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss:
 • Service cost comprising current service cost, past-
service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and non-
routine settlements; and
 • Net interest expense or income

13.  Grants
13.1  Government grants are recognized where there is reasonable 
assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached 
conditions will be complied with.
13.2 Grant relating to Assets (Capital Grants)
 In case of grants relating to depreciable assets, the cost of the 
asset is shown at gross value and grant thereon is treated as 
Deferred Income which are recognized as “Other Operating 
Revenues” usually in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the 
period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged.
13.3 Grant related to Income (Revenue Grants)
 Revenue grants are recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the 
entity recognizes as expenses the related cost for which the 
grants are intended to compensate.
 Subsidy and budgetary support towards under recoveries are 
recognized in “Revenue from Operations” as per schemes 
notified by Government from time to time, subject to final 
adjustments, wherever applicable.
 The Group has treated waiver of duty under EPCG Scheme 
as revenue grant as the condition of meeting the export 
obligations is a primary condition of availing the grant as per 
the EPCG Scheme. The above grant is set up by recording 
the assets at gross value and corresponding grant amount as 
deferred income. Such grant is recognized in “Other Operating 
Revenues” in proportion of export obligations actually fulfilled 
during the accounting period. In case of post export EPCG 
Duty Credit Scrip Scheme, revenue grant is recognized in 
“Other Operating Revenues” equivalent to the amount of 
Custom duty remission in proportion to export obligations 
actually fulfilled during the accounting period.
 Revenue grants are generally recorded under “Other 
Operating Revenues” , except northeast excise duty exemption 
which is netted off with the related expense.
13.4  When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments 
or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current 
applicable market rate or NIL interest rate, the effect of this 
favourable interest is regarded as a government grant. The 
loan or assistance is initially recognized and measured 
at fair value and the government grant is measured as the 
difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and 
the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently measured 
as per the accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities. 
Classification of the grant is made considering the terms and 
condition of the grant i.e., whether grants relate to assets or 
otherwise.
14. Oil & Gas Exploration Activities
14.1 Pre-acquisition Cost:
 Expenditure incurred before obtaining the right(s) to explore, 
develop and produce oil and gas are expensed as and when 
incurred.
14.2 Exploration Stage:
 Acquisition cost relating to projects under exploration are 
initially accounted as “Intangible Assets under Development” . 
The expenses on oil and gas assets that is classified as 
intangible include:
 – acquired rights to explore
 – exploratory drilling cost
 Cost of Survey and prospecting activities conducted in the 
search of oil and gas are expensed as exploration cost in the 
year in which these are incurred
 If the project is not viable based upon technical feasibility and 
commercial viability study, then all cost relating to Exploratory 
Wells are expensed in the year when determined to be dry.
 If the project is proved to be viable, then all cost relating to 
drilling of Exploratory Wells shall be continued to be presented 
as “Intangible Assets under Development” .
14.3 Development Stage:
 Acquisition cost relating to projects under development stage 
are presented as “Capital Work-in-Progress” .
 When a well is ready to commence commercial production, 
the capitalized cost corresponding to proved developed 
oil and gas reserves is reclassified as ‘Completed wells/ 
Producing wells’ from “Capital Work-in-Progress/ Intangible 
Assets under Development” to the gross block of assets. 
Examples of Oil and Gas assets that might be classified as 
Tangible Assets include development drilling cost, piping and 
pumps and producing wells.
14.4 Production Phase
 Production cost include pre-well head and post-well head 
expenses including depreciation and applicable operating 
costs of support equipment and facilities are expensed off.
 Depletion is calculated using the Unit of Production method 
based upon proved and developed reserves.
14.5 Abandonment Phase
 In case of development/production phase, abandonment/ 
decommissioning amount is recognized at the present value 
of the estimated future expenditure. Any change in the present 
value of the estimated decommissioning expenditure other than 
the unwinding of discount is adjusted to the decommissioning 
provision and the carrying value of the corresponding asset. 
The unwinding of discount on provision is charged in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss as finance costs.
14.6 Impairment of E&P Assets
14.6.1 Impairment testing in case of Development and 
producing assets
 In case of E&P related development and producing 
assets, expected future cash flows are estimated using 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
management’s best estimate of future oil and natural gas 
prices, production volumes, proved & probable reserves 
volumes and discount rate. The expected future cash flows 
are estimated on the basis of value in use concept. The 
value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be 
generated by the projected oil or gas production profiles 
up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each 
producing field, based on current estimates of proved and 
probable reserves and on reasonable & supportable fiscal 
assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of 
the range of economic conditions that will exist over the 
remaining useful life of the asset. Management takes a long-
term view of the range of economic conditions over the 
remaining useful life of the asset and, are not based on the 
relatively short-term changes in the economic conditions. 
However, impairment of exploration and evaluation assets 
is to be done in line with para 14.6.2
14.6.2 Impairment in case of Exploration and Evaluation assets
 Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for impairment 
where an indicator for impairment exists. In such cases, while 
calculating recoverable amount, in addition to the factors 
mentioned in 14.6.1, management’s best estimate of total 
current reserves and resources are considered (including 
possible and contingent reserve) after appropriately 
adjusting the associated inherent risks. Impairment loss 
is reversed subsequently, to the extent that conditions for 
impairment are no longer present.
14.6.3 Cash generating unit
 In case of E&P assets, the Group generally considers 
a project as cash generating unit. However, in case 
where the multiple fields are using common production/
transportation facilities and are sufficiently economically 
interdependent the same are considered to constitute a 
single cash generating unit (CGU).
15. Current Versus Non-Current Classification
 The Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet 
based on current/non-current classification as below.
15.1 An asset is treated as current when it is:
 • Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle
 • Held primarily for the purpose of trading
 • Expected to be realised within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 • Cash or Cash Equivalents unless restricted from being 
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period
 All other assets are classified as non-current.
15.2 A liability is treated as current when:
 • It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle
 • It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
 • It is due to be settled within twelve months after the 
reporting period, or
 • There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of 
the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period
 All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
16. Non-Current Assets Held For Sale
16.1  The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups 
as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale rather than through continuing use. 
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it 
is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or 
that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must 
be committed to the sale expected within one year from the 
date of classification.
16.2  For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of 
non-current assets for other non-current assets when the 
exchange has commercial substance. The criteria for held for 
sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
for sales (or disposal groups), its sale is highly probable; and it 
will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The Group treats sale 
of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when:
 • The appropriate level of management is committed to a 
plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),
 • An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the 
plan has been initiated (if applicable),
 • The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed 
for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its 
current fair value,
 • The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification, and
 • Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is 
unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made 
or that the plan will be withdrawn.
16.3  Non-current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair 
value less cost to sell. Assets and liabilities classified as held 
for sale are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.
 PPE and Intangible Assets once classified as held for sale are 
not depreciated or amortised.

17. Financial Instruments
 A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instruments.
17.1 Financial Assets
 Initial recognition and measurement
 All Financial Assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in 
the case of Financial Assets not recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction cost that are attributable to the 
acquisition of the financial assets. However, trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets measured at 
fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Subsequent measurement
 For the purpose of subsequent measurement, Financial 
Assets are classified in four categories:
 o Financial Assets at amortised cost
 o Debt Instruments at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
 o Equity Instruments at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
 o Financial Assets and derivatives at Fair Value Through 
Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
17.1.1 Financial Assets at Amortised Cost
 A Financial Asset is measured at the amortised cost if both 
the following conditions are met:
 a) The asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual 
cash flows,   and
 b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.
 After initial measurement, such Financial Assets are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of 
the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income 
in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are 
recognized in the profit or loss. Apart from the same, any 
income or expense arising from remeasurement of financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, in accordance with 
Ind AS 109, is recognized in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. This category generally applies to trade and other 
receivables.
17.1.2 Debt Instrument at FVTOCI
 A ‘Debt Instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of 
the following criteria are met:
 a) The objective of the business model is achieved both 
by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the 
Financial Assets, and
 b) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent solely 
payments of principal and interest (SPPI).
 Debt Instruments included within the FVTOCI category 
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date 
at fair value. Fair Value movements are recognized in the 
Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However, the Group 
recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals 
and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the 
equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned 
whilst holding FVTOCI Debt Instrument is reported as 
interest income using the EIR method.
17.1.3 Equity Instrument at FVTOCI (Other than Subsidiaries, 
Joint Ventures, and Associates)
 All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured 
at fair value. The Group has made an irrevocable election 
to present subsequent changes in the fair value in Other 
Comprehensive Income. The classification is made on initial 
recognition/transition and is irrevocable.
 There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment.
 Dividend income is recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss when the Group’s right to receive dividend is 
established.
1 7.1.4 Debt Instruments and Derivatives at FVTPL
 FVTPL is a residual category for Debt Instrument. Any 
debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for 
categorization as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is 
classified as at FVTPL.
 This category also includes derivative financial instruments 
entered into by the Group that are not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
Ind AS 109.
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
 Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category 
are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest income on such 
instruments has been presented under interest income.
17.1.5 Derecognition
 A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial 
asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Balance 
Sheet) when:
 • The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have 
expired, or
 • The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay 
to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement 
and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
 When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has 
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of 
the asset, the Group continues to recognize the transferred 
asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Group also recognizes an associated liability. 
The transferred asset and the associated liability are 
measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations 
that the Group has retained.
 Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee 
over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the 
original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum 
amount of consideration that the Group could be required 
to repay.
17.1.6 Impairment of Financial Assets
 In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies Expected 
Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition 
of impairment loss on the following Financial Assets and 
credit risk exposure:
 a) Financial Assets that are Debt Instruments, and are 
measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, 
deposits, trade receivables and bank balance
 b) Lease Receivables under Ind AS 116
 Simplified Approach
 The Group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of 
impairment loss allowance on Trade Receivables.
 The application of simplified approach does not require the 
Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes 
impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
 As a practical expedient, the Group uses a provision matrix 
to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of 
its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its 
historically observed default rates over the expected life of 
the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking 
estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed 
default rates are updated and changes in the forward-
looking estimates are analysed. On that basis, the Group 
estimates provision on trade receivables at the reporting 
date.
 General Approach
 For recognition of impairment loss on other Financial Assets 
and risk exposure, the Group determines that whether there 
has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial 
recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 
12-months ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. 
However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime 
ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of 
the instrument improves such that there is no longer a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, 
then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss 
allowance based on 12-months ECL.
 Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting 
from all possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument. The 12-months ECL is a portion of 
the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are 
possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
 ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized 
during the period is recognized as expense /income in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Balance Sheet 
presentation for various financial instruments is described 
below:
 • Financial Assets measured as at amortised cost: ECL 
is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of 
the measurement of those assets in the Balance Sheet. 
The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until 
the asset meets write-off criteria, the Group does not 
reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying 
amount.
 • Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since Financial 
Assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment 
allowance is not further reduced from its value. Rather, 
ECL amount is presented as ‘accumulated impairment 
amount’ in the OCI.

Extraordinary Performance, Robust Transition Notes to Financial Statements
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
17.2 Financial Liabilities
1 7. 2 .1  Initial recognition and measurement.
 Financial Liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and 
financial liabilities at amortised cost, as appropriate.
 All Financial Liabilities are recognized initially at fair value 
and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, they are measured net of directly 
attributable transaction cost. In case of Financial Liabilities 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
liabilities are recognized immediately in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
 The Group’s Financial Liabilities include trade and other 
payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial 
instruments.
17 .2.2  Subsequent measurement
 The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification, as described below:
 A. Financial Liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or 
Loss
  Financial Liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition 
as at fair value through Statement of Profit or Loss. 
Financial Liabilities are classified as held for trading if 
they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in 
the near term. This category also includes derivative 
financial instruments entered into by the Group that 
are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge 
relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
  Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 B. Financial Liabilities at amortised cost
  Financial Liabilities that are not held-for-trading and 
are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at 
amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting 
periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities 
that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are 
determined based on the effective interest method. 
Gains and losses are recognized in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognized 
as well as through the EIR amortisation process.
 Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are 
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included 
as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
17.2.3 Derecognition
 A Financial Liability is derecognized when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
17.3 Embedded Derivatives
 If the hybrid contract contains a host that is a financial asset 
within the scope of Ind AS 109, the Group does not separate 
embedded derivatives. Rather, it applies the classification 
requirements contained in Ind AS 109 to the entire hybrid 
contract. Derivatives embedded in all other host contracts 
are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair 
value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not held for trading or designated at fair value through 
profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss, unless designated as effective 
hedging instruments. Reassessment only occurs if there is 
either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required or a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through 
profit or loss.
17.4 Offsetting of Financial Instruments
 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset, and 
the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized 
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
17.5  Derivative Instrument- Initial recognition/subsequent 
measurement
 The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps and forward 
commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, 
interest rate risks and commodity price risks, respectively. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at 
fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The 
accounting for subsequent changes in fair value of derivatives 
depends on the designation or non- designation of derivative 
as hedging instruments. Derivatives are carried as Financial 
Assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities 
when the fair value is negative.
17.5.1 Derivative that are designated as Hedge Instrument
 The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward 
contracts commodity forward contracts and interest 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
rates swap contracts for hedging foreign currency risks, 
commodity price risks and interest rate risks respectively. 
The Company generally designates the whole forward 
contract as hedging instrument. These hedges are 
accounted for as cash flow hedges. These hedging 
instruments are as per the policies approved by the Board 
of Directors.
 At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company 
formally designates and documents the hedge relationship 
to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting 
and the risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes the 
Company’s risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking hedge, the hedging/ economic relationship, 
the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being 
hedged, hedge ratio and how the entity will assess the 
effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair 
value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged 
item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
 Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in 
achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that the 
hedge is actually have been highly effective throughout the 
financial reporting periods for which it was designated.
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income and 
accumulated under the heading Cash Flow Hedge Reserve 
within Equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognized immediately in the Statement of 
Profit and Loss and included in the Other Income or Other 
Expenses as Gain on Derivatives or Loss on Derivatives 
respectively.
 Amounts previously recognized in OCI and accumulated 
in equity relating to effective portion are reclassified 
to Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line item as 
the recognized hedged item or treated as basis adjustment 
if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability. 
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss accumulated in equity is 
transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting.
17.5.2 Derivatives that are not designated as hedge 
instrument
 The Company enters into certain derivative contracts to 
hedge risks which are not designated as hedges. Such 
contracts are accounted for at fair value through the 
Statement of Profit and Loss and are included in the Other 
Income or Other Expenses as Gain on Derivatives or Loss 
on Derivatives respectively.
17.6 Commodity Contracts
 Commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be 
held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial 
item in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale 
or usage requirements are held at cost.
18. Cash and Cash Equivalents
 Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise 
cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less, which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdraft 
(negative balance in Account) is shown under short term 
borrowings under Financial Liabilities & Positive balance in 
that account is shown in Cash & Cash Equivalents.
19. Treasury Shares
 Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation, IOC Shares Trust 
has been set up by IOCL for holding treasury shares in relation 
to IBP and BRPL mergers. The shares held by IOC Shares 
Trust are treated as treasury shares.
 Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) 
are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or 
loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity 
instruments.
20. Fair Value Measurement
20.1 The Group measures financial instruments, such as, 
derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.
20.2 The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either in the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal 
or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the 
Group.
20.3 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the 
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in 
their economic best interest.
20.4 A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into 
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the 
asset in its highest and best use.

20.5  The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.
20.6  All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured 
or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
 Level 1 -  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities
 Level 2 -  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
 Level 3 -  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
 For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial 
statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the 
hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as 
a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
 In case of Level 3 valuations, external valuers are also involved 
in some cases for valuation of assets and liabilities, such as 
unquoted Financial Assets, loans to related parties etc.
 For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has 
determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the 
level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
21. Earnings Per Share
 The basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing 
the net profit/(loss) after tax for the year attributable to the 
Equity Shareholders of the Holding Company by the weighted 
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year, 
adjusted for bonus elements in equity shares issued during 
the year and excluding treasury shares. The holding company 
did not have any potentially dilutive securities in the years 
presented.
22. Business Combinations and Goodwill
22.1  In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to first time 
adoption, the Group has elected to apply Ind AS accounting 
for business combinations prospectively from 1 April 2013. As 
such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations 
entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been 
carried forward with minimal adjustment. The same first-
time adoption exemption is also used for associates and joint 
ventures.
22.2  Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured 
at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
 At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and 
the liabilities assumed are recognized at their acquisition date 
fair values. For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include 
contingent liabilities representing present obligation and they 
are measured at their acquisition fair values irrespective of the 
fact that outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
is not probable. However, the following assets and liabilities 
acquired in a business combination are measured at the basis 
indicated below:
 • Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the assets or 
liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are 
recognized and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 
Income Tax and Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits respectively.
 • Liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based 
payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based 
payments arrangements of the Group entered into to 
replace share-based payment arrangements of the 
acquire are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 
Share-based Payments at the acquisition date.
 • Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for 
sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 Non-current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured 
in accordance with that standard.
 • Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined on 
the basis of the remaining contractual term of the related 
contract. Such valuation does not consider potential 
renewal of the reacquired right.
 When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the Financial 
Assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, 
economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded 
derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
 If the business combination is achieved in stages, any 
previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in 
profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.
 Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..)
that is a financial instrument and within the scope of Ind 
AS 109 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value 
with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. If the 
contingent consideration is not within the scope of Ind AS 
109, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate Ind AS. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-
measured at subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its 
settlement is accounted for within equity.
22.3 Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognized for non-controlling interests, and any previous 
interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired 
is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of 
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and 
reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still 
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain 
is recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital 
Reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain 
purchase, the entity recognizes the gain directly in equity as 
capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.
 After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
 A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated 
is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than 
its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on 
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
 Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized in profit or loss. 
An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent periods.
 Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation when determining 
the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these 
circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the 
disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
 If the initial accounting for a business combination is 
incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts 
for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted through goodwill during 
the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are 
recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts 
and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that 
date. These adjustments are called as measurement period 
adjustments. The measurement period does not exceed one 
year from the acquisition date.
23. Non-Controlling Interest
 Non-controlling interest represent the proportion of income, 
other comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries 
that is not attributable to the Company’s shareholders. Non-
controlling interest is initially measured at the proportionate 
share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interest is the amount of the interest at 
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity.
III.  NEW STANDARDS/AMENDMENTS AND OTHER 
CHANGES EFFECTIVE APRIL 1,2022 OR THEREAFTER
 Ministry of Corporate Affairs notifies new standard or 
amendments to the existing standards. During the year, no 
new standard or modifications in existing standards have 
been notified which will be applicable from April 1, 2022, or 
thereafter.
IV.  STANDARDS/AMENDMENTS AND OTHER CHANGES 
ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
 Ministry of Corporate Affairs notifies new standard or 
amendments to the existing standards. On 31st March 
2023, vide Notification G.S.R. 242(E) dated 31st March 2023, 
modifications in existing standards have been notified which 
will be applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:
 a.  Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements:
  The amendment proposes the company to disclose 
material accounting policy information rather than 
significant accounting policy. An accounting policy 
information is material if, when considered together 
with other information included in an entity’s financial 
statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions that the primary users of general-purpose 
financial statements make on the basis of those financial 
statements. The effective date for adoption of this 
amendment is reporting periods beginning on or after 
April 1, 2023. The effect of this amendment is expected to 
be insignificant.

 b.  Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors:
  The amendments propose new definition of “Accounting 
Estimates” which replaces the definition of “Change 
in Accounting Estimates” . As per the new definition, 
“Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial 
statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty” . 
The effective date of this amendment is reporting periods 
beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The effect of this 
amendment is expected to be insignificant.
 c. Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes:
  The amendment narrowed the scope of the initial 
recognition exemption so that it does not apply to 
transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting 
temporary differences in context to leases and 
decommissioning liabilities. Subsequently, post this 
amendment, the company need to recognize deferred 
tax asset and liability on lease and decommissioning 
liability. The effective date of this amendment is reporting 
periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The effect of 
this amendment is expected to be insignificant.
NOTE-1A: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Contd..) NOTE – 1B: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES & JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of 
contingent liabilities. These include recognition and measurement 
of financial instruments, estimates of useful lives and residual value 
of Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets, valuation 
of inventories, measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units, measurement of employee benefits, actuarial 
assumptions, provisions etc.
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result 
in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The Group 
continually evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on 
the most recently available information. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized prospectively in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss in the period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future periods affected.
A. JUDGEMENTS
 In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
management has made the following judgements, which 
have the significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements:
 Materiality
 Ind AS requires assessment of materiality for accounting and 
disclosure of various transactions in the financial statements. 
Accordingly, the Group assesses materiality limits for various 
items for accounting and disclosures and follows on a 
consistent basis. Overall materiality is also assessed based on 
various financial parameters such as Gross Block of assets, 
Net Block of Assets, Total Assets, Revenue and Profit Before 
Tax. The materiality limits are reviewed and approved by the 
Board of the Holding Company.
 Oil & Gas Reserves
 The determination of the group’s estimated oil reserves 
requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied 
and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Reserves 
are estimated using independent reservoir engineering 
reports and factors such as the availability of geological and 
engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition, 
and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity 
prices all impact on the determination of the group’s estimates 
of its oil reserves. Independent reservoir engineers perform 
evaluations of the Corporation’s oil and natural gas reserves 
on an annual basis. The group determines its proved reserves 
estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with 
rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on 
conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. 
Refer note-35 for related disclosure.
 Intangible Asset under Development
 Acquisition costs and drilling of exploratory well costs are 
capitalized as intangible asset under development and are 
reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that exploration 
drilling is still under way or work has been determined / under 
way to determine that the discovery is economically viable 
based on a range of technical & commercial considerations 
and for establishing development plans and timing, sufficient 
/ reasonable progress is being made. If no future activity is 
planned on reasonable grounds / timeframes, Intangible 
asset under development and property acquisition costs is 
written off. Upon start of production from field and recognition 
of proved reserves, cost carried as intangible asset under 
development is transferred to producing properties. Also refer 
Note-35 for related disclosures.
 Contingencies
 Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of 
business in relation to claims against the Group, including 
legal, contractor, land access and other claims. By their 
nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more 
uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment 
of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies 
inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and 
the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. 
Refer Note-37 for the related disclosures.
B. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 The key assumptions concerning the future and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances 
and assumptions about future developments, however, may 
change due to market changes or circumstances arising 
that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are 
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
 Defined benefit plans/Other Long term employee benefits
 The cost of the defined benefit plans and other long term 
employee benefit plans are determined using actuarial 
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various 
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in 
the future. These include the determination of the discount 
rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the 
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term 
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to 
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed 
at each reporting date.
 The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. 
The management considers the interest rates of government 
securities based on expected settlement period of various 
plans.

 Further details about various employee benefit obligations are 
given in Note 36.
 Fair value measurement of financial instruments
 When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on 
quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured 
using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow 
(DCF) model based on level-2 and level-3 inputs. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets where 
possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement 
is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include 
considerations of inputs such as price estimates, volume 
estimates, rate estimates etc. Changes in assumptions about 
these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial 
instruments. Also refer Note 40 for further disclosures of 
estimates and assumptions.
 Impairment of Financial Assets
 The impairment provisions for trade receivables are made 
considering simplified approach based on assumptions 
about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the 
inputs to the impairment calculation based on the company’s 
past history and other factors at the end of each reporting 
period. In case of other financial assets, the Group applies 
general approach for recognition of impairment losses 
wherein the Group uses judgement in considering the 
probability of default upon initial recognition and whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an 
ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. Also refer 
Note-41 for impairment analysis and provision.
 Provision for decommissioning
 At the end of the operating life of the Corporation’s facilities 
and properties and upon retirement of its oil and natural gas 
assets, decommissioning costs will be incurred. Estimates 
of these costs are subject to uncertainty associated with 
the method, timing, and extent of future decommissioning 
activities. The liability, related asset and expense are 
impacted by estimates with respect to the costs and timing of 
decommissioning. Refer note-18 for the provisions in respect 
of decommissioning cost.
 Income Taxes
 The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the 
relevant facts, circumstances, present and past experience, 
rulings, and new pronouncements while determining the 
provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences 
and tax losses can be utilised.

uncertainty over availment of eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) and retaining tariff of H 3.14/Kwh as per RRECL order 
dated 05.03.2019.
F. Hitherto, the estimated residual value of LPG cylinders (other than composite cylinders) and Pressure Regulators was considered as 
15% of original cost. Based on realization of scrap value in recent past, the estimated residual value of those assets has been increased 
from 15% to 25% of original cost effective from April 01, 2022. The impact on account of above change is reduction in depreciation 
charge by H293.08 crore in FY 2022-23 which will be offset over future periods in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
G. During the year, classification of Retail Visual Identity (RVI) elements has been reviewed and some of the items having gross block of 
H1,213.06 crore classified under Buildings, Plant & Equipment and Office Equipments have been reclassified as ‘Furniture and Fixtures’ . 
The impact on account of this change is increase in depreciation charge by H 61.31 crore during FY 2022-23 which will be offset over 
future periods in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
H. Railways had claimed transfer of ownership of certain assets provided by the Parent Company at Railway premises which was not 
accepted in prior years by the Parent Company and the said assets were continued to be part of Plant, Property & Equipment of 
the Parent Company. Railways, in its latest tender has asserted its position on ownership of these assets and has again maintained 
status quo in their earlier stand/position during FY 2022-23. Management has accepted Railways’ contention in view of the continued 
business relation. Consequently, assets amounting to H81.26 crore (WDV as on 01.04.2022) has been derecognized and charged to 
loss on sale/disposal of assets during the year.
I. For further details regarding ROU Assets, refer ‘Note - 37’ .
J. In accordance with the requirements prescribed under Schedule II to Companies Act, 2013, the Group has adopted useful lives as 
prescribed in that schedule except in some cases as per point no. 2.4.1 of significant accounting policies (Note-1).

A. Adjusted for bonus shares pertaining to those held under IOC Shares Trust
Nature and Purpose of Reserves 
A. Retained Earnings
 The retained earnings comprises of general reserve and surplus which is used from time to time to transfer profits by appropriations. 
Retained earnings is free reserve of the Company and is used for the purposes like issuing bonus shares, buy back of shares and other 
purposes (like declaring Dividend etc.) as per the approval of Board of Directors. It includes the re-measurement of defined benefit 
plan as per actuarial valuations which will not be reclassified to statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.
B. Bond Redemption Reserve
 As per the Companies Act 2013, a Bond Redemption Reserve is required to be created for all bonds/ debentures issued by the 
company at a specified percentage. This reserve is created out of appropriation of profits and is transferred back to general reserve 
on repayment of bonds for which it is created. In 2019, this requirement was dispensed with in case of public issue/ private placement 
of debentures by listed companies to NBFCs, Housing Finance Companies and other listed companies.
C. Capital Redemption Reserve
 As per the Companies Act 2013, capital redemption reserve is created when company purchases its own shares out of free reserves 
or securities premium. A sum equal to the nominal value of the shares so purchased is transferred to capital redemption reserve. 
Utilization of this reserve is governed by the provisions of the Companies Act 2013 and accordingly the parent company has used its 
reserves in current financial year for issuing bonus shares.
D. Capital Reserve
 Capital Reserve was created through business combinations and shall be utilised as per the provisions of the Companies Act 2013.

 Resettlement Benefit:
 Resettlement benefit is allowed to employees to facilitate them to settle down upon retirement.
 Ex gratia Scheme:
 Ex-gratia is payable to those employees who have retired before January 01, 2007 and either not drawing pension from superannuation 
benefit fund (as they superannuated prior to January 01, 1987, i.e. introduction of superannuation benefit fund scheme in IndianOil) or 
are drawing a pension lower than the ex gratia fixed for a Grade (in such case differential amount between pension and ex gratia is 
paid).
 Employees Compensation for injuries arising out of or during the course of employment:
 Employees covered under the Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923 who meet with accidents, while on duty, are eligible for 
compensation under the said Act. Besides, a lumpsum monetary compensation equivalent to 100 months’ Pay (BP+DA) is paid in 
the event of an employee suffering death or permanent total disablement due to an accident arising out of and in the course of his 
employment.
 Felicitation of Retired Employees:

C. Other Long-Term Employee Benefits - General Description
 Leave Encashment:
 Each employee is entitled to get 8 earned leaves for each completed quarter of service. Encashment of earned leaves is allowed 
during service leaving a minimum balance of 15 days subject to maximum accumulation of 300 days. In addition, each employee 
is entitled to get 5 sick leaves (in lieu of 10 Half Pay Leave) at the end of every six months. The entire accumulation of sick leave is 
permitted for encashment only at the time of retirement. DPE had clarified earlier that sick leave cannot be encashed, though Earned 
Leave (EL) and Half Pay Leave (HPL) could be considered for encashment on retirement subject to the overall limit of 300 days. 
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has advised the company to comply with the said DPE Guidelines. However, in 
compliance to the DPE guidelines of 1987 which had allowed framing of own leave rules within broad parameters laid down by the 
Government and keeping in view operational complications and service agreements the parent company had requested concerned 
authorities to reconsider the matter. Subsequently, based on the recommendation of the 3rd Pay Revision Committee, DPE in its 
guidelines on pay revision, effective from January 01, 2017 has inter-alia allowed CPSEs to frame their own leave rules considering 
operational necessities and subject to conditions set therein. The requisite conditions are fully met by the parent company.
 Long Service Award:
 On completion of specified period of service with the Group and also at the time of retirement, employees are rewarded with amounts 
based on the length of service completed. It is a mode of recognizing long years of loyalty and faithful service in line with Bureau of 
Public Enterprises (currently DPE) advice vide its DO No. 7(3)/79-BPE (GM.I) dated February 14, 1983. On receipt of communication 
from MoPNG advising us that the issue of Long Service Award has been made into an audit para in the Annual Report of CAG of 
2019, the Parent Company has been clarifying its position to MoPNG individually as well as on industry basis as to how Long Service 
Awards are not in the nature of Bonus or Ex-gratia or honorarium and is emanating from a settlement with the unions under the 
Industrial Dispute Act as well as with the approval of the Board in line with the DPE’s advice of 1983. The matter is being pursued with 
MoPNG for resolution. Pending this the provision is in line with Board approved policy.

an option of availing LTC or encashing the entilements of LFA.

 Note:
 The management has assessed that fair values of Trade Receivables, Trade Payables, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Bank Balances & 
Bank Deposits, Loans (incl. Security Deposits) other than mentioned above, Short Term Borrowings (incl. Current Maturities of Long 
Term Borrowings), Floating Rate Borrowings, Lease Liabilities, Other Non-Derivative Current/Non-Current Financial Assets & Other 
Non-Derivative Current/Non-Current Financial Liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.
 Methods and Assumptions
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values at the reporting date:
 A. Level 1 Hierarchy:
  (i) Quoted Equity Shares: Closing quoted price (unadjusted) in National Stock Exchange of India Limited, Tel Aviv Stock 
Exchange, Israel and NASDAQ, New York
  (ii) Quoted Government Securities: Closing published price (unadjusted) in Clearing Corporation of India Limited
  (iii) Foreign Currency Bonds - US Dollars: Closing price (unadjusted) for the specific bond collected from active market
  (iv) Unit Trust Investment/PMS: Closing NAV for the specific investment available in Trust Bulletin/Newspaper/PMS
 B. Level 2 Hierarchy:
  (i) Derivative Instruments at FVTPL: Replacement cost quoted by institutions for similar instruments by employing use of 
market observable inputs.
  (ii) Hedging Derivatives at FVTOCI: Replacement cost quoted by institutions for similar instruments by employing use of market 
observable inputs.
  (iii) Loans to employees : Discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for items on similar terms, credit risk 
and remaining maturities, adjusted for insignificant unobservable inputs specific to such loan like principal and interest 
repayments are such that employee get more flexibility in repayment as per the respective loan schemes.
NOTE - 40: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Contd..)
  (iv) Non-Convertible Debentures, Loan from Odisha Government and USD 100 Mn Term Loan: Discounting future cash flows 
using rates currently available for items on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities (Excluding floating rate 
borrowings).
  (v) Term Loans from Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB): Discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for 
similar type of borrowings (OIDB Borrowing Rate) using exit model as per Ind AS 113.
 C. Level 3 Hierarchy:
  (i) Unquoted Equity Instruments: Fair values of the unquoted equity shares have been estimated using Market Approach & 
Income Approach of valuation techniques. The valuation requires management to make certain assumptions about the 
model inputs, including forecast cash flows, discount rate, credit risk and volatility. The probabilities of the various estimates 
within the range can be reasonably assessed and are used in management’s estimate of fair value for these unquoted equity 
investments.
  (ii) PMUY Loan: Fair value of PMUY loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using approximate interest rates 
applicable on loans given by Banks duly adjusted for significant use of unobservable inputs in estimating the cash flows 
comprising of specific qualitative and quantitative factors like consumption pattern, assumption of subsidy rate etc.
 The significant unobservable inputs used in fair value assessment categorised within Level 3 of the Fair Value Hierarchy 
together with a quantitative sensitivity analysis as on March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are shown below:

 Notes:
 1.   During the year, Mer Rouge Oil Storage Terminal Company Limited (MOST) has been designated as a Joint Venture of the Group. Hence the investment in 
Unquoted Equity Instruments of MOST ceases to be a FVTOCI instrument and accordingly amount of ₹14.57 crore has been transferred out from Level 3 
hierarchy.
 2.   During the year, Equity shares of Lanzatech New Zealand Limited were listed on NASDAQ, New York as Lanzatech Global Inc. post its business combination 
with AMCI Acquisition Corp. on 08.02.2023. Hence, the quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets are available for fair valuation. Accordingly, the fair value 
hierarchy level has been changed for these equity shares from Level 3 to Level 1 in current year. Fair value of the instrument as on 31.03.2023 is ₹192.12 crore 
(2022: ₹410.23 crore). Last year figure has not been reclassified into Quoted Equity Shares (Level 1) and continues to be part of Unquoted Equity Instruments 
(Level 3).
II.  Disclosures relating to recognition of differences between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price
 In the following cases, the Group has not recognized gains/losses in profit or loss on initial recognition of financial assets/financial 
liability, instead, such gains/losses are deferred and recognized as per the accounting policy mentioned below.
 Financial Assets
 1.  Loan to Employees
  As per the terms of service, the Group has given long term loan to its employees at concessional interest rate. Transaction price 
is not fair value because loans are not extended at market rates applicable to employees. Since implied benefit is on the basis of 
the services rendered by the employee, it is deferred and recognized as employee benefit expense over the loan period.
 2. PMUY loan
  The PMUY loan is the interest free loan given to PMUY beneficiaries towards cost of burner and 1st refill. The loan is interest 
free and therefore transaction price is not at fair value. The difference between fair value and transaction price is accumulated in 
Deferred expenses and amortized over the loan period on straight line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 3. Security Deposits
  The security deposit is paid to landlord in relation to lease of land. The security deposit is interest free and therefore transaction 
price is not fair value.The difference between fair value and transaction price is accumulated in Deferred expenses and amortized 
over the loan period on straight line basis in the statement of Profit and loss till March 31, 2019 prior to introduction of IND AS 116.
 Financial Liabilities
 1.  Security Deposits
  In case certain deposits payable to deceased employees under one of the superannuation benefit scheme (R2 option) and 
security deposits received in relation to some revenue expenses contracts, transaction price is not considered as fair value 
because deposits are interest free. The difference between fair value and transaction price is accumulated in Deferred income 
and amortized over the tenure of security deposit on straight line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

NOTE – 41: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK FACTORS
Financial Risk Factors
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise Borrowings, trade and other payables, security deposits, 
employee liabilities and lease obligation. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide 
guarantees to support its operations. The Group’s principal financial assets include loans & advances, trade and other receivables, short-
term deposits and cash/cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. The Group also holds FVTOCI investments and enters 
into derivative transactions.
The Group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial 
instruments including market risk relating to interest rate, commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price, credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
The Risk Management Commitee comprised of senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Group’s senior 
management is supported by a Risk Management Compliance Board that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk 
governance framework for the Group. The Risk Management Committee provides assurance to the Board that the Group’s risks are 
governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s 
policies, risk objectives and risk appetite.
The Group’s requirement of crude oil are managed through integrated function handled through its international trade and optimization 
department. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, 
experience and supervision. As per the Group’s policy, derivatives contracts are taken only to hedge the various risks that the Group is 
exposed to and not for speculation purpose.
The Board of Directors oversee the risk management activities for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below:
A. Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. The major components of market risk are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and other price risk viz. 
equity shares etc. Financial instruments affected by market risk include Borrowings, Deposits, FVTOCI investments and derivative 
financial instruments.
 The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.
 The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity and other post-retirement 
obligations, provisions, and other non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

NOTE – 41: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK FACTORS (Contd..)
 1.   Interest Rate Risk
  The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows of a 
financial instrument, principally financial debt. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates 
primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
  The Group manages to maintain a mix between fixed and floating rates for rupee and foreign currency loans, based on liquidity, 
availability of cost effective instruments and considering the market/regulatory constraints etc. The Group also use interest rate 
swap contracts for managing the interest rate risk of floating interest rate debt. As at March 31, 2023, approximately 39% of the 
Group’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (March 31, 2022: 57%).
  As the publication of USD LIBOR benchmark will be phased out by the end of June 2023, the Company has adopted various 
strategies like pre-payment and refinancing of existing instruments during the past couple of years for smooth transitioning 
from USD LIBOR benchmark. For pending loan instruments, the Company has already commenced discussion with the existing 
lenders for transition to alternate reference rate, viz., SOFR. However, the Company is not expecting any material financial impact 
of transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR on its floating rate loans linked to USD LIBOR and associated derivative contracts which 
are maturing beyond 30th June 2023.
  The table below gives information about financial instruments that are to be transited to an alternative benchmark rate 
as at :
(J in crore)
Particulars Balances subject to USD LIBOR
1. Non-derivative Financial Assets Nil
2. Non-derivative Financial Liabilities (Foreign Currency Loans) 15,217.56
3. Derivatives (Interest Rate Swap*) 1,643.50
   *Nominal Amount
  The management is likely to complete the transition exercise of the existing USD LIBOR linked instruments before 30th June 
2023.
  The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected, with all other 
variables held constant, on INR and USD floating rate borrowings is as per table below. The Group’s exposure to interest rate 
changes for all other currency borrowings is not material.

INR –50 70.09 –50 52.61
US Dollar –50 340.21 –50 199.00
 2.  Foreign Currency Risk
  Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating 
activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and Borrowings.
  The Group manages its foreign currency risk through combination of natural hedge, mandatory hedging and hedging undertaken 
on occurence of pre-determined triggers. The hedging is mostly undertaken through forward contracts.
  The Group has outstanding forward contract of ₹ 2,473.89 crore as at March 31, 2023 (March 31, 2022: ₹ 3,610.54 crore) which has 
been undertaken to hedge its exposure to borrowings and other financial liabilities.
  The sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD/INR exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, the impact on 
the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including non-designated foreign

  The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results which are offset by changing cost 
competitiveness, lags in market adjustments to movements in rates to its other non-financial assets like inventory etc. For this 
reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the Group’s reported results.
 3.  Commodity Price Risk
  The Group is exposed to various commodity price related risk such as Refinery Margins i.e. Differential between the prices of 
petroleum products & crude oil, Crude Oil Price fluctuation on accounts of inventory valuation fluctuation and crude oil imports, 
etc. As per approved risk management policy, the Group can undertake refinery margin hedging, inventory hedging and crude 
oil price hedging through swaps, options and futures in the OTC market as well as domestic exchanges to mitigate the risk within 
the approved limits.

 4.  Equity Price Risk
  The Group’s investment in listed and non-listed equity securities, other than its investments in Joint Ventures/Associates and 
Subsidiaries, are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities.
  At the reporting date, the exposure to unlisted equity securities at fair value was ₹ 1,148.67 crore. Sensitivity analysis of these 
investments have been provided in Note 40.
  The exposure to listed equity securities valued at fair value was ₹ 18,188.71 crore. An increase/decrease of 5% on the market index 
could have an impact of approximately ₹909.44 crore on the OCI and equity attributable to the Group. These changes would not 
have an effect on profit or loss.

 5.  Derivatives and Hedging
  (i)  Classification of derivatives
   The Group is exposed to certain market risks relating to its ongoing business operations as explained above.
   Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives 
do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. 
   Information about the derivatives used by the Group and outstanding as at the end of the financial year is provided

  (ii) Hedging activities
   The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
     Commodity Price Risk
   IndianOil buys crude and sells petroleum products linked to international benchmark prices and these benchmark prices do 
not move in tandem. This exposes IndianOil to the risk of variation in refining margins which is managed by margin hedging.
   The risk of fall in refining margins of petroleum products in highly probable forecast sale transactions is hedged by 
undertaking crack spread forward contracts. The Group wants to protect the realization of margins and therefore to mitigate 
this risk, the Group is taking these forward contracts to hedge the margin on highly probable forecast sale in future. Risk 
management activities are undertaken in OTC market i.e. these are the bilateral contracts with registered counterparties.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
     Foreign Currency Risk
   The Group is exposed to various foreign currency risks as explained in A.2 above. As per Group’s Foreign Currency & 
Interest Rate Risk Management Policy, the Group is required to fully hedge the short term foreign currency loans (other than 
revolving lines and PCFC loans) and at least 50% of the long term foreign currency loans based on market conditions.
   Apart from mandatory hedging of loans, the Group also undertakes foreign currency forward contracts for the management 
of currency purchase for repayment of crude/product liabilities based on market conditions and requirements. The above 
hedgings are undertaken through delivery based forward contracts.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
     Interest Rate Risk
   The Group is exposed to interest rate risks on floating rate borrowings as explained in A.1 above. Group hedges interest rate 
risk by taking interest rate swaps as per Group’s Interest Rate Risk Management Policy based on market conditions. The 
Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to interest payments for floating rate borrowings denominated in 
foreign currencies.
   All these hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
 Hedge Effectiveness
 There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as the terms of the foreign exchange 
and commodity forward contracts match the terms of hedge items. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging 
relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity forward contracts are identical to the hedged 
risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against 
the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. In case of interest rate swaps, as the critical terms of 
the interest rate swap contracts and their corresponding hedged items are similar, the Group performs a qualitative assessment of 
effectiveness and it is expected that the value of the interest rate swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items 
will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates.
 Source of Hedge ineffectiveness
 In case of commodity price risk, the Group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be 
material:
 • Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments
 • Different indexes linked to the hedged risk of the hedged items and hedging instruments
 • The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instruments and hedged items 
 • Changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments
 In case of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, the main source of hedge ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and 
the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of hedge contracts, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged items. The effect 
of this is not expected to be material.

 Trade Receivables
 Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating 
to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and 
individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored 
and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees or other forms of credit insurance, 
wherever required.
 An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large number of 
minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The Group applies Simplified 
approach for providing the expected credit losses on Trade Receivables as per the accounting policy of the Group. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in Note 10. The Group 
evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and 
industries and operate in largely independent markets.

 The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the Balance Sheet at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is the 
carrying amounts as provided in Note 4, 5, 6, 11 & 12. The Group applies General approach for providing the expected credit losses on 
these items as per the accounting policy of the Group.
 Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance with 
the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to 
each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are approved by the Group’s Board of Directors. The limits are set to minimise the 
concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
 The Group has given loans to PMUY (Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana) customers which are shown under Loans in Note-5. PMUY 
loans are given to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families as per GOI scheme wherein free LPG connections are issued by Oil 
Marketing Companies (OMCs) to the women belonging to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. As per the scheme, OMCs are 
providing an option for interest free loan towards cost of burner and 1st refill to PMUY consumers which is to be recovered from the 
subsidy amount payable to customer when such customers book refill.
 In case of certain PMUY loans, the Company has determined that there is significant increase in the credit risk. The Company considers 
the probability of default upon initial recognition of the loan and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an 
ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. It considers past experience and time elapsed since the last refill for determining 
probability of default on collective basis. The Company has categorized the PMUY loans wherein credit risk has increased significantly 
under various categories considering the likelihood of default based on time gap since last refill. ECL is provided @ 80% (2022: @ 
80%) in case of time gap since last refill is more than 12 months but not exceeding 18 months, @ 90% (2022: @ 90%) in case of time 
gap is more than 18 months but not exceeding 24 months and @ 100% (2022: @100%) for those consumers who have not taken any 
refill more than 24 months. ECL is provided for the loans where the refill is taken within last 12 months based on experience ratio of 
more than 12 months as above. The PMUY loans are classified as credit impaired as on reporting date considering significant financial 
difficulty in case the customer has not taken any refill from past 24 months (2022: 24 months).
 In case of other financial assets, there are certain credit impaired cases mainly due to breach of contract arising due to default or 
bankruptcy proceedings.

region, or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in 
economic, political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments

1 In order to provide clean cooking fuel to BPL families, Government has approved “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)” scheme 
where free LPG connections are issued by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to the women belonging to the Below Poverty Line 
(BPL) households as per SECC -2011 (Rural) database. The scheme was launched on May 1, 2016. As per the scheme, the initial 
cost towards connection charges (Refundable deposit) would be borne by the Central Government for each card holder. Few State 
Governments have also extended this scheme to other beneficiaries. As per the scheme, OMCs would provide an option for EMI/
Loans towards cost of burner and 1st refill to the PMUY consumers. The loan amount is to be recovered from the subsidy amount 
payable by the government to the customers on each refill sale. During the year, discounting of the loan has been done based on 
assumption of average refills in a year and average subsidy rate per cylinder under respective range of subsidy buckets.
 The amount of outstanding as at March 31, 2023 towards PMUY claim from Central Government is ₹ 46.30 crore (2022: ₹ 8.63 crore) 
and loan to PMUY consumers is ₹ 2567.27 crore (2022: ₹ 2770.67 crore) (net of recovery through subsidy). Against the above loan, 
a provision for doubtful loans amounting to ₹ 766.38 crore (2022: ₹ 601.46 crore) has been created as at March 31, 2023 against 
the beneficiaries who have not taken any refill for more than 12 months based on expected credit loss(ECL) model and applying 
experience factor based on experience ratio of doubtful provision on more than 12 months to the loans in less than 12 month category. 
(Also refer Credit Risk under Note 40)
 The Group has remeasured the gross carrying amount of PMUY loan as at Balance Sheet date based on revised estimated future 
contractual cash flows resulting in reduction in PMUY loans by ₹ 41.51 crore (2022: ₹ 489.00 crore) which has been charged to 
Statement of Profit and Loss in Note - 29.1 under the head “Amortisation and Remeasurement of PMUY Assets”

Coal India Ltd for transfer of explosives business to the said venture Company on slump sale basis at a value of ₹ 311.00 crore (Net 
Assets WDV of ₹ 132.00 crore as at March 31, 2022), consent of Niti Ayog was initially received for formation of the JV vide letter dated 
April 27, 2018. However, the formation of the JV is not carried forward on account of subsequent communication dated July 11, 2018 
from MoPNG. The matter is under deliberation and accordingly, the explosive business continues to be in operation as at March 31, 
2023. The Net Asset WDV of the business as at March 31, 2023 is ₹ 79.70 crore.
3 During the FY 2022-23, the Parent Company has recognised an arbitration award in its favour in a case between the Parent Company 
& Nayara Energy Limited (“NEL” , formerly known as Essar Oil Ltd.). NEL has paid Take or Pay (“ToP”) liability amounting to ₹288.62 
crore and interest thereon amounting to ₹483.81 crore. Additionally, the Parent Company had already encashed bank guarantee 
amounting to ₹186.00 crore. As per the award NEL has make-up gas right for ToP payments and accordingly ₹474.62 crore has been 
accounted for as “Advance from Customers” under Current Non- Financial liability. The Parent Company has accounted ₹483.81 crore 
under the head interest income.
4 During the FY 2022-23, the Parent Company was not able to utilise the committed capacity booked for calendar year 2022 as per 
regasification agreement dated January 29, 2014 with Petronet LNG Limited (PLL). Hence, PLL has raised invoice for such unused 
capacity as “Pay for, if not used obligation” amounting to ₹227.08 crore for Contract Year 2022 as per terms and conditions of the 
Contract. The Parent Company has provided for such regasification charges under the head miscellaneous expenses in Note-29.1.
5 During certain periods of Financial Year 2019-20, retail selling prices of domestic LPG cylinders were lower than desired rates, 
resulting in reduced sales realisation. This difference in realisation relating to DBTL customers amounting to ₹305.40 crore was 
claimed from Government of India, along with subsidy under PAHAL (DBTL) Scheme 2014. As the claim has not yet been approved, 
the Parent Company has derecognised the same during Financial Year 2022-23 and shown under “Net Loss on de-recognition of 
Financial Assets at Amortised Cost.

STATEMENT SETTING OUT THE MATERIAL 
FACTS RELATING TO THE SPECIAL BUSINESS 
IN PURSUANCE OF SECTION 102(1) OF THE 
COMPANIES ACT, 2013 
Item No. 4
To increase the Authorized Share Capital of the Company and 
amend the Capital clause in the Memorandum of Association 
& Articles of Association of the Company.
The present Authorised Share Capital of the Company is  
H 15000 crore and the Paid-up Share Capital is H 14121.24 crore. 
Considering the overall business growth and future expansion 
and the operational needs, the Company may be required to raise 
funds through equity or debt. While the Company is considering 
the various options, it is proposed to increase the Authorised Share 
Capital as per applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
and its corresponding rules, amendments thereof.
Section 61 of the Companies Act, 2013, (including any statutory 
modification(s) or re-enactment thereof, for the time being in 
force) provides that a limited company having a share capital may, 
if so authorized by its Articles of Association, with the consent of 
its members in its general meeting or through Postal ballot, alter 
the conditions of its Memorandum of Association so as to increase 
its share capital by such amount as it thinks expedient by issuing 
new shares.
Article 42 of the Articles of Association empowers the Company to 
increase its Authorised Share Capital.  Currently there is no scope 
to consider any equity fund raise as the paid-up share capital is 
H 14121.24 crore as against Authorised Share Capital of H 15000 
crore, it is proposed to increase the Authorised Share Capital of 
the Company from H 15000,00,00,000 (Rupees Fifteen Thousand 
Crore only) divided into 1500,00,00,000 (One Thousand Five 
Hundred Crore) Equity Shares of H 10 (Rupees Ten only) each to 
H 30000,00,00,000 (Rupees Thirty Thousand Crore only) divided 
into 3000,00,00,000 (Three Thousand Crore) Equity Shares of H 10 
(Rupees Ten only) each.
Consequently, the existing clause 5 of the Memorandum 
of Association of the Company and Clause 6 of Articles of 
Association of the Company need to be altered to reflect  increase 
in the authorised share capital and substitution of the proposed 
increased Authorised Share Capital.
The above-mentioned increase in the Authorised Share Capital 
of the Company and subsequent alteration of aforesaid clause of 
Memorandum of Association and Article of Association will require 
approval of the Members. The Board of Directors recommends the 
resolutions at item no. 4 to be passed as Special Resolution.
None of the Directors/Key Managerial Personnel and their 
relatives is concerned or interested in the passing of the aforesaid 
resolution as mentioned at item no. 4 above, except to the extent 
of their shareholding, if any.
The Board recommends the Special Resolution as 
set out in the Notice for approval by the Members.

financial statements, whichever is lower.
IndianOil undertakes transactions with its Related Parties (RPs)  
i.e. Subsidiary, Associate, Joint Venture Companies in the course of 
its business for which approval of Audit Committee is obtained in 
compliance with extant provisions of the Act & Listing Regulations. 
In view of the provisions of Reg.23 of Listing Regulations and 
further clarification provided by SEBI from time to time, prior 
approval of members for material RPT’s is to be taken on annual
