CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Shri Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries
Adoption of concepts like circularity 
in our chemical products also brings 
us closer to a low carbon economy. 
We have partnered with accomplished 
innovator entities globally, with 
whom we share the common goal 
of establishing a sustainable world 
economy. We are leveraging their 
expertise to derive maximum value for 
our new energy initiatives. We recognise 
the urgency of addressing the issues 
emanating from climate change. We 
believe our new energy initiatives will 
contribute to the global effort of limiting 
the rise in average temperatures. 
It is important for us to ensure the 
wellbeing of our employees and 
communities. We lay great emphasis on 
the health, safety and development of 
all our employees, customers, business 
partners and local communities. 
Human rights considerations have 
been at the core of Reliance’s DNA 
since inception. The principles of 
human rights are enshrined in our 
internal codes of conduct as well as our 
business partner codes of conduct. Our 
Reliance Foundation works round the 
clock driving initiatives in education, 
healthcare and social development 
that have impacted millions of lives 
over the years. Abiding by our principle 
of inclusive growth, our teams across 
businesses work at a grass root 
level to identify the needs of every 
stakeholder involved and commit to 
securing their interests and maintaining 
their satisfaction.
Managing large and diverse 
businesses is not possible without a 
robust governance structure. We, as 
a company, have always strived 
to maintain the highest levels of 
governance in our management. 
We emphasise the importance of 
Board oversight, given the fact that 
the company’s diverse and evolving 
operations impact essential sectors 
of the Indian economy. The Board 
Committees at Reliance have clearly 
defined roles and mandates. We are 
committed to adhering to the best 
practices and to adapting to emerging 
standards of governance. 
Pursuing the path of good governance, 
we constituted the ESG committee 
to ensure our continued alignment to 
best ESG practices and compliance 
with applicable ESG frameworks. The 
committee will advise the board and 
other committees on environmental, 
social and governance aspects involved 
in the conduct of business activities.
We have entered an era of 
transformation – transformation to a 
greener and a more inclusive economy. 
Our businesses, our people and our 
practices are evolving and adapting to 
the new age with a renewed zest. Our 
newest growth engine, our new energy 
business is poised to become a pioneer 
and lead the way towards just global 
energy transition. 
Creation of an Independent 
Financial Services Business
My dear friends, as you are aware 
that this year we have demerged our 
financial services arm into a separate 
listed entity named “Jio Financial 
Services Limited” (JFS). I thank you 
for your wholehearted support to 
this initiative.
Today’s India is young and 
entrepreneurial, adopting digital 
finance at an unprecedented pace. The 
digital revolution has penetrated every 
corner of the nation through Jandhan 
Accounts, digital payments, usage of 
smart phones and low cost data. The 
growth opportunities presented by 
financial services are remarkable and 
provide a strong directional support to 
the economy. 
As various financial services are governed 
by different regulatory frameworks, 
we believe, an independent financial 
services entity will allow us to access 
the opportunities available in the 
Indian market. 
Jio Financial Services Limited along 
with its subsidiaries will leverage the 
technological capabilities of Reliance 
and digitally deliver financial services, 
democratising access to financial 
services offerings for Indian citizens. 
Jio Financial Services aims to provide 
simple, affordable and innovative digital 
first solutions. 
Jio Financial Services Limited is 
positioned uniquely to capture the growth 
opportunities in financial services sector 
and play a crucial role in transforming the 
landscape of digital finance in India. 
Financial Performance 
Summary for the Year
There was continued volatility in the 
global markets amidst disruptions in 
trade flows and economic uncertainties. 
Despite the headwinds, Reliance 
was able to deliver another year 
of remarkable performance both 
on operating and financial fronts. 
Consolidated EBITDA was at `1,53,920 
crore which is a robust 24.4% growth as 
compared to last year. Consolidated net 
profit also grew at 11.3% to `73,670 crore.
The impressive growth was well rounded 
and supported by all our business 
segments. Consumer businesses 
continued their growth trajectory with 
a rapid expansion of retail store footprint 
and strong subscriber acquisition 
in Jio. O2C business delivered a record 
performance amidst a challenging 
business environment. 
A switch to cleaner energy 
sources is key to our 
decarbonisation strategy. 
We are making significant 
strides in establishing a 
world class solar energy 
value chain. We are also 
progressing on building a 
green hydrogen ecosystem. 
Our goal is to provide 
affordable green hydrogen 
as a viable alternative to 
traditional fuels.
Our goal is to become Net Carbon Zero 
by 2035. Accordingly, the development 
of giga factories at the Dhirubhai 
Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex 
at Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. 
Considering the collective potential 
of our five giga factories, we are well 
on track for establishing a world class, 
self-sufficient green energy ecosystem. 
The transition from traditional fossil 
fuels to renewable energy sources 
is going to be a crucial milestone in 
our history. We, as a company, have 
a proven record of creating value 
through transformational changes, be 
it the digital revolution through Jio, 
transforming consumer experience 
and the retail landscape in India or 
the integration of our refining and 
petrochemicals businesses into the oil 
to chemicals value chain.

CONSOLIDATED NET PROFIT

Dear and esteemed 
fellow shareholders,
We, at Reliance, have a 
deep-rooted belief that 
sustainability is an integral 
part of enterprise growth. 
The tremendous stress that 
mankind has exerted on 
natural resources, since the 
advent of the Industrial 
Revolution, has brought 
us to a stage where we 
need to collectively ramp 
up our efforts to combat 
climate change. 
The Paris Agreement of 
2015 entered into at the 
21st Conference of Parties 
(COP 21) brought the world 
together in this pursuit.  
Our company’s ESG 
ambitions are aligned 
with this global quest. On 
a personal note, it is a 
privilege for me to serve on 
the Advisory Committee of 
COP 28 UAE, and contribute 
to this ongoing effort.

CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
Oil and gas segment also registered 
a strong performance with sustained 
gas production from KG D6 block.
Elevated inflation levels led to an 
aggressive rate hike by central banks 
through the financial year. Our 
prudent financial framework helped 
optimise the returns and minimise 
the risks while providing adequate 
liquidity to our businesses. Our strong 
cash flows from operations have ably 
supported growth capex requirements. 
Over the past 2 years, 98% of the 
company’s capex has been funded by 
internally generated cash profits. This 
has helped us maintain a strong and 
conservative balance sheet and retain 
superior investment grade ratings.  
Robust Operational 
Performance
Reliance touches the lives of 
millions of consumers in India and 
worldwide through its energy and 
consumer businesses. Our teams 
across businesses work dedicatedly 
to achieve operational excellence and 
deliver quality performance.
Premier League on Jio Cinema. Jio 
Platforms powered the technology 
behind streaming these events. The 
new home broadband back up plan is 
the latest addition to the bouquet of 
broadband services and is expected to 
grow the broadband market further. 
Jio retained its preeminent position 
in the Indian telecom space with 
439.3 million subscribers as on 
March 2023, with a net addition of 
29.2 million subscribers during the 
year. The strong growth in the digital 
services business is aptly reflected in 
its financial performance for the year. 
With an increase of 24.9% from the 
previous year, digital services EBITDA 
for FY 2022-23 stood at `50,286 crore. 
Jio commits itself to continually 
innovate and launch newer 
technologies and products and 
expand the market for digital services. 
Jio True 5G stack is one such feature 
loaded indigenous technology, 
offering superior performance. It is 
secure, cost effective and also easy to 
install. This technology is fully cloud 
native, software defined, digitally 
managed and supports advanced 
features like Quantum Security. 
Jio AirFiber is also an innovative 
solution, offering clutter free and 
high speed connectivity to users with 
the capability of supporting multiple 
devices simultaneously without 
compromising on the quality of 
connectivity. JioDive is a technology 
that helps users to explore the virtual 
reality universe through a smartphone 
based headset. JioDive runs on the 
JioImmerse application which offers 
users exclusive VR experiences in 
gaming, learning, entertainment 
and wellness, all accessible through 
their smartphone.
I believe Jio’s digital offerings have 
established it as a strong market 
leader in India’s digital services 
ecosystem. The scale of Jio’s 
operation and advantages of deep 
penetration help Jio grow stronger 
with the launch of each new offering. 
Jio’s vision is to make the highest level 
of connectivity available to the masses 
at affordable prices at all times. 
Retail 
Reliance Retail further consolidated 
its position as the largest retailer 
in India and the only Indian retailer 
to feature in the top 100 retailers 
globally. FY 2022-23 witnessed 
Reliance Retail cross the 1 billion 
transactions mark.
The retail business expanded its 
store network with over 3,300 new 
stores added during the financial year, 
taking the store tally to 18,040 stores 
Pan-India. Our stores now cover 
65.6 million sq ft of store area which 
is a more than 50% growth of retail 
space as compared to the previous 
year. Footfalls increased by 50% 
from last year to 780 million. The 
registered customer base also grew 
to 249 million, establishing Reliance 
Retail as the preferred shopping venue 
of Indian citizen across formats.
During the year, Reliance Retail 
entered into the beauty segment by 
launching the “Tira” digital platform 
and opening its flagship store in 
Mumbai. The business also expanded 
its product basket through acquisitions 
and partnerships at both local and 
global levels like Metro, Campa Cola, 
GAP, Pret A Manger, Lotus, Sosyo, 
Maliban, Toffeeman to name a few.
Reliance Retails runs an integrated 
network of physical stores, digital 
commerce and new commerce 
initiatives. Through digital brands like 
Ajio and Netmeds, digital commerce 
is scaling up at a rapid pace and is 
contributing to the strong growth of 
retail segment. The launch of JioMart 
on WhatsApp is a truly novel initiative 
which combines online shopping 
experience with the simplicity of 
instant chat services. Growth in 
new commerce business has been 
fast paced with rapid expansion 
of its merchant partner network. 
Currently, more than 3 million 
merchants have partnered with our 
new commerce platforms. 
Retail segments EBITDA stood at 
`17,974 crore which reflects a strong 
44.7% increase from the previous 
year. The EBITDA growth was well 
supported by all verticals right from 
grocery to fashion and lifestyle.
Reliance Retail is an indispensable part 
of the Indian household’s shopping 
experience not only in metro regions 
but also in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. 
Reliance Retail envisions to expand 
its offerings and scale of operations 
to make best in class products 
available to the Indian consumers at 
affordable prices.
During the year our teams across sites 
worked towards finding sustainable 
solutions. The first ever green 
hydrogen production was achieved 
with firing of torrefied biomass in 
gasifiers. Biomass firing in Coal Fired 
Boilers (CFBs) at petrochemical 
sites increased to >11% of total feed 
in line with our decarbonisation 
efforts. Ethanol blending in motor 
spirit (EBMS) facility was also 
commissioned. We also successfully 
commissioned the demo plant for 
our patented Continuous Catalytic 
Pyrolysis oil technology. 
Our O2C business is transforming. 
From switch to renewable sources 
of energy and newer energy 
technologies to promoting the 
concept of circular economy especially 
for our petrochemical products, 
sustainable business techniques are 
rapidly gaining momentum.
MJ field at the KG D6 Block 
commenced production post testing 
and commissioning activities. At 
peak production of ~30 MMSCMD, 
KG D6 block will contribute ~30% 
of the domestic gas production. 
Operationalization of the KG D6 MJ gas 
field is a crucial step towards enhancing 
India’s energy security. 
Conclusion
Dear fellow shareholders, Reliance, 
as a company has grown multifold by 
delivering value to the citizens, the 
country and global community. Our 
products are ingrained in the lives of the 
citizens and are an integral part of their 
daily routines. Our various businesses 
have always identified the needs of the 
society and worked towards devising

The current needs of the society are 
sustainable solutions which can tackle 
climate change through affordable 
green energy and inclusive growth. Our 
initiatives in New Energy businesses and 
our consumer businesses are aimed at 
meeting societal needs and aspirations. 
Using the right technology, deploying 
the right talent and through empowering 
our young leaders, I am confident that 
we can make the world a better place to 
live in for future generations. 
I would like to express my sincere 
appreciation to the Board of Directors 
for their continued guidance. I would 
like to thank our teams across 
businesses, for their dedicated work 
and commitment to excellence. I would 
also like to extend my gratitude to all

Digital Services
Digital services continued its 
strong performance through the 
strengthening of existing offerings 
and introducing newer services in 
its portfolio. During the year, Jio 
launched the True 5G services in India. 
By the end of the financial year, Jio’s 
5G coverage expanded to 2,300+ 
cities and towns, demonstrating 
an impressive pace of network 
installation. The rollout of FTTH 
services also gained momentum 
during the year. 
Millions of viewers enjoyed the live 
action of the FIFA World Cup, the 
first ever Women’s Premier League 
and the 16th edition of the Indian 
Oil to Chemicals
Despite facing major operational 
challenges given the highly volatile 
global scenarios, our O2C business 
posted highest ever earnings 
excluding the impact of SAED. 
Revenues increased on account 
of improved price realisation for 
transportation fuel, tracking higher 
average oil prices for the year. O2C 
business EBITDA stood at `62,075 
crore with a healthy 17.7% increase 
as compared to last year despite 
considering the SAED levy of 
`6,648 crore. EBITDA growth was 
driven by feedstock flexibility, sharp 
improvements in fuel cracks and 
advantageous ethane cracking. 
During the year, our refinery 
processed 13 new variants of crude 
oil, broadening the feedstock sources. 
Demand for transportation fuels 
was strong for the year reflecting 
the opening up of economies post 
pandemic restrictions. Demand for 
downstream chemical products 
remained subdued globally, but was 
strong in the domestic markets. 
Oil and Gas Exploration 
and Production  
Performance of the exploration 
and production segment was 
noteworthy for the year. The 
revenue more than doubled and the 
EBITDA was 2.5x the previous year 
number at `13,589 crore. The growth 
in EBITDA was primarily on account 
of improved gas price realisation and 
higher gas production in the KG D6 
block. Domestic production was, in 
fact, at a 10-year high. I am proud to 
share that we have an exceptional 
record of safety in our upstream 
business with another year 100% 
incident free operations.

and Review
China. China growth is expected to 
rebound to 5.2% in CY23 from 3% 
on reopening of the economy after 
three years and continued monetary 
policy support. India is expected to 
remain amongst the fastest growing 
economies as per IMF.
Indian Economy
The Indian economy remained 
relatively stable amidst the global 
imbalances caused by the Russia- 
Ukraine conflict. The economy grew 
at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, down from 
9.1% in FY 2021-22, as per the National 
Statistical Office data release. 
The spike in global commodity prices 
pushed up prices in India too, with 
retail inflation peaking at 7.79% in April 
2022, above the medium-term target 
band of 2%-6% of the RBI. The RBI 
took stringent measures to combat 
the rising prices, hiking repo rate six 
times in FY 2022-23, from 4% at the 
beginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at 
the close of the financial year. Private 
consumption, however, witnessed 
a strong surge fuelling a boost in 
production across sectors. Domestic 
sector services activity remained 
resilient with average Services PMI 
higher at 57.5 in FY23 vs 52.2 in 
FY22. Manufacturing too remained 
robust with average manufacturing 
PMI higher at 55.8 in FY23 vs 54.1 in 
FY22. Credit growth gained traction 
with year-on-year growth of 15% (as 
of March ’23) while deposit growth 
lagged with year-on-year growth of 
9.6%, leading to a rise in incremental 
credit-deposit ratio.
India overtook Japan and Germany 
to become the third largest 
automobile market in terms sales in 
December 2022. India also emerged 
as the second largest mobile phone 
manufacturer globally. India’s digital 
adoption continues in an accelerated 
way. UPI payments continued their 
impressive run in FY 2022-23, with 
transaction volumes almost doubling 
from ~45 billion in FY 2021-22 to ~84 
billion in FY 2022-23, while transaction 
value also surged to ~139 lakh crore 
in FY 2022-23 from ~84 lakh crore in 
FY 2021-22. The pan- India monthly 
mobile data traffic stood at 14.4 
Exabyte in 2022 with 3.2x growth 
over last five years. Rapid digitisation 
supported by solid infrastructure is 
driving efficiency and productivity in 
the economy. India’s external sector 
continued to gain strength as FY23 
merchandise exports grew to $447 
billion, growing at 6% Y-o-Y and 
services exports grew to $322 billion, 
growing at 27% Y-o-Y.
Global supply chain improvements 
and falling commodity prices coupled 
with softening domestic demand are 
likely to moderate inflation to 5.1% 
in the current financial year. With 
a growing working age population, 
a large domestic market, boost to 
infrastructure development and 
advent of digitisation, India is well 
positioned to be the fastest growing 
large economy in the world. India GDP 
is expected to grow at 6.5% in FY24.
Performance Overview
Reliance delivered strong annual 
performance amid macro headwinds 
caused by geo-political conflicts, 
disruptions in commodity trade 
flows and economic downturn. 
Resilience of Reliance’s strategic and 
operational capabilities reflected 
in its ability to adapt to dynamic 
business environments and navigate 
through complex business situations. 
Growth was supported by agile and 
efficient operations by all business 
teams with sound strategic planning 
and implementation.
Earnings growth was led by rebound 
in O2C business, backed by healthy 
domestic demand, strong fuel 
margins and high utilisation rates. 
Oil and gas segment performance 
reflected volume growth in KG D6 
gas production, higher gas price 
realisations and margin improvements. 
Operational efficiencies continued 
with 100% uptime.
Fiscal prudence and proactive risk management formed the guide rails for 
navigating a challenging macro environment. Despite synchronised raising of 
policy rates by Central Banks and volatility in commodity prices, we contained the 
rise in finance costs while ensuring the Balance Sheet has strength and liquidity to 
support growth initiatives.
Global Economy
Global economy grew 3.4% in CY22, 
slowing from the post-COVID rebound 
of 6.2% in CY21. Growth was in-line 
with pre-pandemic average (2015-
19) of 3.4% despite Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and aggressive rate hikes by 
central banks. Advanced economies 
(AEs) saw above-trend growth of 
2.7% in CY22, higher than the 2.1% 
average seen in the five years prior 
to the pandemic. This was led by 
strong growth in both US and Euro 
area which grew at 2.1% % and 3.5% 
respectively. Inflationary pressures 
remained near multi-decade highs 
in AEs, with US inflation averaging 
8% Y-o-Y (highest since 1980s), while 
Euro area inflation also averaged a 
multi-decade high of 8.4%. Developed 
market central banks aggressively 
tightened their monetary policy to 
address inflation, with US Federal 
Reserve raising rates by 450bps in 
CY22, while European Central Bank 
hiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging 
Market and Developing Economies 
(EMDEs) grew 4% in CY22, below the 
pre-pandemic average of 4.4% due 
to slowdown in Chinese economy 
amidst frequent lockdowns. China 
growth eased to 3%, well below the 
pre-pandemic average of 6.7% on 
continued zero-COVID policy and 
housing downturn. Crude oil prices 
were elevated during FY 2023, 
averaging $93/bbl, remaining above 
$100/bbl in first half of the fiscal 
year due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, 
but receding in the second half with 
Chinese demand slowing and release 
of strategic petroleum reserves from 
OECD countries.
Global growth is expected to slow in 
CY23 to 2.8% as the lagged impact 
of synchronised global monetary 
tightening. Growth in advanced 
economies is expected to decelerate 
to 1.3%, with US and Euro area 
growth expected at 1.6% and 0.8% 
respectively. Effect of rapid rate 
hikes over last one year as well as 
emerging credit crunch risks from US 
regional banks remain key concerns 
for advanced economies. Emerging 
markets growth is expected to hold 
near pre-pandemic average at ~3.9% 
in CY23, supported by India and

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Consumer business segments 
continued to strengthen their 
positions in the market with 
aggressive expansion of footprint and 
strategically prudent acquisitions. Jio 
successfully launched True 5G services 
across over 2,300 towns and cities, 
thereby continuing to offer enhanced 
digital experiences to its subscribers. 
The retail business broadened its 
product and distribution base further, 
making available a vast assortment of 
products and brands to its consumers 
at affordable prices.
Reliance Jio Financial Services is 
demerged. The new entity is expected 
to unlock value for shareholders and 
give them an opportunity to be a part 
of a new growth platform.
The New Energy business is 
making rapid progress with fast 
paced implementation of the 
giga factories at Jamnagar. With 
strategic partnerships and significant 
investments in newer technologies, 
Reliance is well on track for building 
the New Energy business as a strong 
sustainable growth engine and 
achieving the target of becoming 
Net Carbon Zero. 
H9,74,864 CRORE
CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN 
FY 2022-23 ↗ 23.6% Y-O-Y
Revenue 
Reliance attained a consolidated 
revenue of `9,74,864 crore 
($118.6 billion), up 23.6%, as compared 
to `7,88,743 crore in the previous year. 
All operating segments saw growth in 
revenue. O2C revenues increased on 
account of improved price realisation 
for transportation fuels with 19% 
increase in average Brent crude prices. 
Sharp increase in gas price realisation 
coupled with increase in the gas 
production contributed to growth in 
Oil & Gas segment revenues. Retail 
Segment revenue was driven by 
strong broad-based growth across all 
consumption baskets and large-scale 
store expansion. Digital Services 
revenue was led by full impact 
of tariff hike, ramp-up of wireline 
services and continued subscriber 
addition for mobility services. 
Profit
Consolidated EBITDA for the year 
increased by 24.4% to `1,53,920 
crore ($18.7 billion) as compared 
to `1,23,684 crore in FY 2021-22. 
Retail business led EBITDA 
growth with 44.7% increase 
mainly due to benefits of scale 
and operating leverage leading 
to margin expansion. Growth in 
Digital Services segment EBITDA 
was 24.9% on account of higher 
revenue and steady improvement 
in margins. O2C EBITDA increased 
by 17.7% with sharp improvement in 
transportation fuel cracks and robust 
demand which was partially offset 
by introduction of SAED on export 
of transportation fuel and lower 
downstream product delta. Oil & Gas 
segment EBITDA increased over 
2.5x with higher gas price realisation. 
Cash Profit increased by 15.4% to 
`1,25,951 crore as compared to 
`1,09,099 crore in the previous year. 
Profit After Tax was higher by 11.3% 
at `73,670 crore. 
Gross Debt
Reliance’s Gross Debt was at 
`3,13,966 crore ($38.2 billion). This 
includes Standalone gross debt 
of `2,15,823 crore and balance in 
key subsidiaries, including Reliance 
Retail (`46,644 crore), Reliance 
Jio (`36,801 crore), Independent 
Media Trust Group (`5,815 crore) 
and Reliance Sibur Elastomers 
(`2,144 crore).
Standalone
RIL ’s Standalone revenue for 
FY 2022-23 was `5,65,347 crore 
($68.8 billion), an increase of 21.6% 
as compared to `4,65,045 crore in 
the previous year. Revenue growth 
was led by increase in crude and 
product prices. Profit After Tax 
was at `43,017 crore ($5.2 billion)

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS → FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REVIEW
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Liquidity and Capital 
Resources
Persistent Inflationary pressures 
and globally rising interest rate 
environment were the key underlying 
themes of financial markets in 
FY 2022-23. The year was also marked 
by a sharp depreciation of the Rupee 
against the Dollar. RIL successfully 
managed its Balance Sheet risks 
through the challenging environment 
while ensuring sufficient liquidity for 
business operations.
External Environment
A persistent broadening of inflation 
pressures triggered a rapid and 
synchronised tightening of global 
monetary conditions, alongside strong 
appreciation of the US dollar against 
most other currencies. 
The rising price pressures were 
expected to produce a squeeze on 
real incomes as well as undermine 
macroeconomic stability. This led 
most Central Banks around the world 
to rapidly lift nominal policy rates 
to much above the pre-pandemic 
levels, both in advanced and 
emerging market economies. The 
US Federal Reserve raised policy 
rates aggressively by 500 bps in past 
fifteen months, the fastest hiking 
cycle since 1980. In Europe, the war-
related intensification of inflationary 
pressures led European Central Bank 
to finally exit its negative interest 
rate regime and ultra-easy monetary 
policy after eight years and raise 
interest rates by 325 bps in past 
nine months. The real activity and 
financial markets responded to the 
removal of monetary accommodation 
with slowing momentum in housing 
market, credit conditions, labour 
markets and PMI surveys. 
In response to progressive rate hikes 
by the Central Banks, the global 
headline inflation started declining in 
the second half of the year. However, 
the decline in inflation print reflects 
the sharp reversal in energy and food 
prices and the core inflation continues 
to remain sticky. Consequently, to 
anchor inflation expectations major 
central banks have signalled the need 
for staying course on a restrictive 
monetary policy stance. 
On the other side, the accelerated 
policy normalisation has brought 
forth vulnerabilities in the US regional 
banks. The risk of contagion across 
the broader financial sector is inducing 
volatility in the financial markets and 
driving market-implied policy path 
on downside. 
RBI too raised rates by a cumulative 
250 bps in the year, in-line with global 
monetary tightening as inflation 
remained persistently above RBI’s 6% 
upper-target band. As the forward 
outlook on inflation moderated 
towards 5-5.5% in the second 
half of the year, RBI guided for a 
conditional pause keeping the policy 
stance focused on withdrawal of 
accommodation. A prolonged pause 
from RBI is expected to progressively 
align headline inflation to its target 
while also supporting growth. 
On the external front, a noticeable 
improvement in India’s current 
account deficit (CAD) on back of 
moderation in oil prices and structural 
strength in India’s services exports, 
is expected to keep CAD benign and 
below 2% of GDP. The outlook on 
capital inflows also looks promising as 
emerging markets growth is expected 
to outperform developed markets. As 
the lagged effect of cumulative hikes 
sets-in, developed markets is expected 
to witness slowdown. In contrast, India 
is expected to emerge as the fastest 
growing economy in FY 2023-24 
with 6.5%, while global growth are 
expected only at 2.8%. Overall, India’s 
growth differential and comfortable 
CAD dynamics are expected to keep 
the Indian Rupee well supported in 
the near to medium-term.
Despite the unprecedented 
macro-economic uncertainty, the 
Company was successfully able to 
navigate abrupt adjustments in the 
market, maintain adequate liquidity 
on its balance sheet, manage its 
financial market risks and deliver a 
consistent return on its investment 
portfolio by staying invested in low 
risk, liquid instruments. Reliance 
Treasury continued to stay focused on 
providing liquidity to the businesses 
at the optimal risk adjusted cost by 
accessing financing from different 
markets and using appropriate 
instruments and currencies.
Treasury Management and 
Financial Strategy
Reliance’s medium term Financial 
Strategy is guided by a Financial 
Planning process which is integrated 
with individual business plans. RIL 
Treasury’s key objectives include 
raising Long Term financing for capex 
and Short-Term liabilities for financing 
working capital at the most efficient 
rates and also design suitable hedging 
strategies to manage currency 
and interest rate risks on both the 
asset and liability side of company’s 
Balance Sheet.
Fund Raising
During FY 2022-23, the Company and 
its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm 
Limited (RJIL) tied up $3 billion 
equivalent through syndicated 
term loan facilities. The transaction 
was heavily oversubscribed in the 
primary syndication market by global 
lenders across geographies. The 
proceeds from the loans were used 
to meet the capital expenditure 
requirements of both the companies. 
This was a landmark transaction on 
various counts:
a)  The aggregate liquidity raised 
from primary syndication was 
$3 billion equivalent, one of the 
largest liquidity raised through 
syndication in Asia Pacific 
(APAC).
b)  55 international lenders across 
all major continents participated 
in the transaction making it the 
largest bank group in a corporate 
loan out of APAC since 2000.
c)  This is the largest syndicated 
loan from India
RJIL tied up its first ever Swedish 
Export Credit Agency (EKN) 
supported facilities of $2.2 billion 
equivalent making it the largest cover 
ever provided by EKN for a deal to a 
private corporate globally.
The proceeds of the facilities shall be 
utilised to finance the equipment and 
services in relation to RJIL ’s pan-India 
5G roll out. 
Liquidity Management
The combination of strong cash 
flows from operations, access to 
unutilised borrowing facilities, and 
robust cash and cash equivalents 
position forms the basis of Reliance 
Industries’ liquidity base. This strong 
liquidity position provides the 
company with financial flexibility, 
enabling it to navigate various 
market conditions, pursue growth 
opportunities, and meet its financial 
obligations effectively.
The operating cycle is closely 
monitored to optimise the working 
capital structure and facilitate 
short term financing. Our proactive 
approach to reviewing trade financing 
solutions and optimising the 
operating cycle demonstrates our 
commitment to robust working capital 
management and effective business 
financing. RIL effectively uses 
Commercial Paper, Working Capital 
Demand Loan and other solutions to 
finance its payables and receivables 
and reduce the cost of funds.
RIL manages its cash and cash 
equivalents through an investment 
portfolio, diversified across 
instruments and counterparties. 
The investments are in highly liquid 
instruments such as government 
bonds, AAA papers, Bank deposits 
and Debt Mutual Funds. The 
investment portfolio is monitored 
under a strong risk management 
framework assuring adherence to 
liquidity objectives. The portfolio 
is calibrated continually to straddle 
between the objectives of capital 
protection, steady returns, and 
provision of adequate liquidity at 
short notice. 
Credit Rating
RILs focussed approach on financial discipline and risk management is reflected in its strong credit rating as it continues 
to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and one notch above sovereign by Moody’s.
Instrument Rating Agency Ratings Remarks
International Debt S&P BBB+ Two notches above India’s sovereign rating
International Debt Moody’s Baa2 One notch above India’s sovereign rating
Long-T erm Debt CRISIL AAA (Stable) Highest rating by CRISIL
Long-T erm Debt CARE AAA (Stable) Highest rating by CARE
Long-T erm Debt ICRA AAA (Stable) Highest rating by ICRA
Long-T erm Debt India Ratings AAA (Stable) Highest rating by India Ratings
Awards and Accolades
In FY 2022-23, RIL won the much-coveted IFR Asia Award for ‘Investment Grade Bond’ for the $4 billion multi-tranche 
Senior Unsecured Notes issued in January 2022.
Way Forward
RIL will continue to draw strength from its robust balance sheet and operating cash flows to create value for its shareholders 
in a sustainable manner by investing in new business opportunities. RIL will continue to monitor financial markets for the 
right opportunity to raise capital to support growth plans of existing and new businesses while maintaining a keen focus on 
financial discipline and risk management.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Indian economy has witnessed a 
smart recovery in FY 2022-23 with the 
waning of the pandemic ahead of many 
nations and has positioned itself as the 
fastest growing large economy in the 
world. Despite the macro-economic 
and geopolitical challenges faced this 
year, India has been a bright spot and a 
major engine of growth for the world. 
This is driven by private consumption 
and capital formation through 
significant investments in infrastructure 
development and ease of doing 
business. Favourable demographics, 
rising income levels, rising share of  
urbanisation, access to better education 
and aspirational lifestyle are some 
of the factors driving consumption 
growth in the country. These trends are 
a force multiplier for the Indian retail 
sector which currently stands at over 
$800 billion and is expected to grow 
at 11% CAGR to become a $2 trillion 
market by 2030.

OUTLOOK
The Indian consumption 
trend is poised to remain 
on an upward trajectory 
supported by several long 
term sustainable tailwinds. 
These include a favourable 
demographic profile, 
increasing per capita 
income, rising aspirations 
supported by affordable 
data that has narrowed 
the information gap, and 
improved access to stores 
and e-commerce in rural 
areas that has deepened 
the reach of brands and 
closed the aspirational 
divide between urban and 
rural consumers.
Furthermore, emerging 
organised retail formats, 
digital and technological 
advancements, the 
ongoing trend of 
urbanisation and greater 
access to financing are 
changing the consumption 
landscape. With per 
capita GDP surpassing the 
critical $2,000 threshold, 
consumer discretionary 
spending is likely to 
trend upward, and these 
trends together suggest a 
promising outlook for the 
Indian retail sector.
Reliance Retail with its 
industry leading store 
network and emerging 
digital platforms, 
investments across the 
consumption value chain 
and its track record of 
strong execution is well 
poised to lead the industry 
in the coming decade.
The Conscious Culture Festival at 
Jio World Drive was an innovative 
and visionary initiative aimed at 
promoting sustainable prosperity by 
fostering a culture that provided a new 
positive vision for the future. A two-
day immersive event held between 
March 4 and 5, 2023 at the Jio World 
Drive in Mumbai, was carefully 
curated to inspire and influence 
change in the community. The 
festival provided a platform for trade, 
art, networking, collaborations and 
learning opportunities in a sustainable 
lifestyle space. The objective of the 
festival was to inspire people to 
build conscious habits by delivering 
experiences that demanded mindful 
actions and exposing them to the 
best conscious homegrown brands 
across fashion, food, home & beauty. 
Alongside, talks and workshops 
were held on upcycling techniques, 
plant care and games conducted 
such as Sustainability Pictionary. The 
event production was designed to 
be carbon conscious, with focus on 
the usage of sustainable materials 
and efficient waste management, 
ensuring the festival’s environmental 
impact was minimised. The Conscious 
Culture Festival at Jio World Drive 
was a significant step towards 
promoting sustainability and creating 
awareness about the importance of 
conscious living.
Conscious Culture 
Festival at Jio World 
Drive, Mumbai Reliance Retail’s theme of 
“Democratising Learning” during the last 
financial year was aimed to empower 
employees to take control of their own 
development and design their careers 
within the Company. The focus of all 
learning initiatives was to create a pull-
based learning culture that customises 
learning to employees’ preferences and 
enables anytime-anywhere-anyplace 
learning. To ensure all employees have 
the desired capability, the learning 
team works at five levels: Ready to 
jumpstart, Strive to perform, Aspire to 
grow, Equip with Future Skills, and Build 
Leadership Capabilities.
i.  The “Ready to Jumpstart” 
programme offers a structured 
learning journey for new 
employees, including organisational 
orientation, culture immersion, 
role-based certifications, and 
manager orientation. Cadre Building 
programmes focus on nurturing 
young talent and hiring and 
developing them.
ii.  In the “Strive to Perform” phase, 
employees continuously upskill and 
reskill to perform effectively in their 
current role. Reliance Retail offers 
easy access to on-demand learning 
opportunities and a Competency-
Based Learning System (CBLS) that 
recommends courses based on 
identified competency gaps.
iii.  The “Aspire to Grow” stage is 
when employees with growth 
potential and high performance 
are considered for next-level job 
readiness. Reliance Retail has a 
Competency Framework for critical 
roles and a structured development 
journey with Individual and Group 
Development programmes. 
The Company also has a Talent 
Mobility process to facilitate career 
growth by aligning individual career 
aspirations with organisational 
talent needs. More than 11,615 
sessions were delivered across 
Democratising Learning
all businesses, with over 19,225 
self-learning modules available 
in LMS. Employees could access 
over 11,000+ courses on LinkedIn 
Learning and 9,700+ courses 
on Coursera anytime, anywhere, 
through the Learn and Grow App.
iv.  Reliance Retail identifies future skill 
requirements through business and 
functional needs. The Company 
has established structured learning 
academies, including the Academy 
of Future Skills, Data & Analytics 
Academy, Tech Academy, and 
Metaverse Learning. These 
academies offer courses and 
learning journeys to develop skills 
and capabilities in new-age skills, 
data analytics, technology, and 
3D-rich learning content. We enable

Capabilities. Over 6,700 employees 
have registered for the trainings 
and 1,700+ employees have been 
already certified.

Development Model emphasises 
agility, human-centricity, inclusive 
growth, and high performance. The 
leadership development academy 
offers four levels of programmes 
based on the organisation’s 
leadership archetypes and 10 tenets 
of leadership capital to build leaders 
who model the desired behaviours 
and foster the desired culture. 400+ 
leaders across multiple levels went 
through these leadership programs.

democratise learning, our employees 
clocked over ~1.4 crore learning hours 
last year.

base in the country 
increasing to well over 
800 million users. 
Over 300 million 2G SIM 
users in the country are 
yet to experience the 
full benefits of digital 
communication networks. 
Increasing affordability and 
launch of devices at lower 
price points would drive 
Jio consolidated its 
leadership position in all 
22 circles by acquiring the 
right to use spectrum in 
the 700MHz, 800MHz, 
1800MHz, 3300MHz 
and 26GHz bands. The 
cost of acquiring the 
right to use the 25,036 
MHz technology-agnostic 
spectrum for 20 years 
amounted to J87,947 
crore. As per the terms of 
the auction, Jio has opted 
for the deferred payment 
option and accordingly, 
paid an upfront amount 
of J7,865 crore and 
balance of J80,082 crore 
is payable in 19 equated 
annual instalments with 
Interest at 7.2% p.a.

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Indian dairy farmers are saddled with 
labour-intensive operations including 
the monitoring and upkeep of cattle. 
This leads to low productivity, high 
animal mortality rates and increased 
costs. Despite being the leading dairy 
producer globally, India’s per capita 
milk production is significantly lower 
than that of global producers.
Jio’s cattle IoT device will assist in 
monitoring the activity levels, food 
habits and rumination of the cattle, 
and also in the detection of early signs 
of diseases. The data collected by 
the device can be shared in real-time 
for benchmarking and analysing 
cattle health and productivity 
using AI. This is then shared with 
the farmer daily through the Jio 
GauSamriddhi application.
With Jio True 5G, retail experiences 
are set to transform. Users can create 
a 3D avatar with a depth sensor-
enabled camera. Using a life-sized 
smart mirror, users can virtually 
try-on a variety of clothing options. 
This can significantly improve the 
choices on offer and add convenience 
to the process, and enhance the 
shopping experience.
Digital Services
Jio’s digital services span 
the entire ecosystem, 
and these capabilities will 
power scale-up of all our 
businesses. This would 
equip Jio to spearhead 
India’s transformation 
into a leading Digital 
Society. Once proven 
at scale, these solutions 
can also be taken to 
the rest of the world. 
Jio True 5G is uniquely 
positioned to deliver 
the best quality, highest 
value digital connectivity 
solutions to every citizen 
of India. The scale of Jio’s 
5G rollout will give it a 
distinct competitive edge 
and accelerate market 
share gains. All this 
will generate strong 
shareholder returns over 
the next several decades.
Approximately 65% of the Indian population lives in rural 
areas with limited access to high-quality, critical pre-
emptive diagnostics. In addition to this, the doctor-patient 
ratio is as low as 1:2000. These limitations often lead to 
delayed detection of diseases, escalated treatment costs, 
and a higher mortality rate.
To address this, Jio will enable a robotic teleradiology 
set-up with a radiological probe at remote sites and a 
haptic controller at specialist doctor sites. Camera feeds will 
relay live patient feed and haptic feedback with no latency. 
Doctors can then examine radiological imaging data and 
diagnose conditions without being physically present at 
the location.
Jio True 5G-enabled community clinics will bring quality 
healthcare to remote geographies using the ‘Clinic in a 
Bag’ platform. Paramedics and ASHA workers can carry 
connected probes such as stethoscopes, ECG machines, 
glucose monitors and ENT probes to remote locations, and 
real-time feedback can be shared with specialised doctors.
Jio 5G can significantly boost per 
capita output by relying on IoT 
and drone-based precision farming 
solutions. 5G-powered drones can 
be flown remotely from distant 
control centres from actual sites 
such as farmers’ premises, district 
or taluka offices, or even the state 
or central headquarters. Drones can 
cover farmlands and multi-spectral 
cameras can be used to scan the 
fields with real-time relay of images 
on the cloud over the 5G network. 
The data can then be analysed using 
AI/ML algorithms to detect insect 
or pest infestations, soil moisture 
and irrigation.
Jio Krishi IoT devices such as weather 
stations and soil testers can aid in 
data-driven farming methods ensuring 
the optimal use of farming resources, 
judicious use of harmful chemicals, 
and improvement in farm productivity.

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
With 7.2% GDP growth in FY 2022-23, 
India is one of the fastest growing 
major economies in the world. 
Despite the impact of high inflation 
due to the sharp rise in oil prices post 
US-Ukraine conflict as well as the 
disruption of global supply chains in 
the aftermath of the pandemic, Indian 
economy fared better than the rest 
of the world. However, consumer 
demand slowed down in the first half 
as prices of consumer goods increased 
to keep pace with raw material 
prices. The increase in lending rates 
in the second half also impacted 
the industrial growth and consumer 
spending power. 
Media and Entertainment sector, 
being inextricably linked to the 
macro-economic environment, 
also faced headwinds during the 
year. While Y-o-Y growth (CY2022 
vs CY2021) was strong at ~20%, 
compared to pre-pandemic levels 
of 2019, total revenue was only 
10% higher. The demand for content 
continued to grow as consumers 
increasingly spent more time on 
media consumption, but monetisation 
faced challenges on both advertising 
and subscription fronts. Growth during 
the year was driven by 30%5 growth 
in Digital segment. Digital advertising, 
including spends by small and 
medium sized businesses, for whom 
digital is often the only marketing 
platform due to limited budgets, 
commanded more than 50% share of 
the total ad revenues. TV’s share in 
the total ad pie declined by ~500 bps 
as the ad revenue on the medium was 
flat. As per various industry reports, 
TV and Digital are the most effective 
mediums for brand building and 
reach, capturing nearly 80% share of 
the total ad spends. Print continued 
to struggle and despite a 13% Y-o-Y 
growth, it remains well below the 
pre-pandemic levels. While cinema 
advertising continues to languish, 
theatrical revenues saw a sharp jump 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
as consumers returned to cinemas and several movies achieved phenomenal 
box-office success. For CY2023, the reports forecast that the M&E industry 
will grow at ~12%, led by digital which is expected to grow at ~18% while TV is 
expected to grow at low single-digit rate.

OTT Advertising and 
Subscription to Continue 
Growing
Given the secular trend of increasing 
smartphone and internet penetration, 
digital medium is expected to 
continue its impressive growth 
for the foreseeable future. Within 
Digital, OTT is one of the fastest 
growing segments as increasingly 
more consumers are spending 
time consuming content on 
these platforms. 
As per the BCG CII Report – Shaping 
the future of Indian M&E, the current 
size of the Indian OTT market is 
$2.6 bn and it is expected to grow at a 
CAGR of 20%-23% to reach $11-13 bn 
by 2030. OTT provides two options 
to the consumer – to consume free 
content which is monetised through 
advertising (AVOD model) or watch 
premium content on paying a 
subscription fees (SVOD model).

As per the same report, India currently 
has 85-90mn paid subscriptions, 
which is expected to nearly double 
to 160-165mn by 2027. Bundling 
of subscriptions through telecom 
plans and emergence of aggregator 
platforms is also expected to aid 
this growth. 
OTT advertising will continue to 
grow on the back of increasing 
internet-connected audience, growing 
time-spend and improving targeting 
advertising capabilities. 
Internet-connected mobile phones 
have been the primary driver for the 
massive growth in digital content 
consumption, responsible for nearly 
90% of this growth. However, the 
engagement levels on big screens 
(TV) continue to be much higher 
than handsets. Connected TVs 
(CTV) offer the best features of both 
traditional and digital eco-system 
– a large screen size and ability for 
targeted advertising, thus providing 
an opportunity to brands to reach 
premium audiences in an intelligent 
fashion. Due to a low penetration of 
CTVs, advertising on the medium is 
currently at a nascent stage in India, at 
just over 1% of total TV spends.
New Tariff Order Finally 
Clears Legal Hurdles
After being mired in multiple 
litigation challenges for more than 
two years, the New Tariff Order was 
cleared for implementation after the 
regulatory body, TRAI, amended 
the regulation post an industry-wide 
consultation process. 
The proposal to lower the price ceiling 
for including a channel in a bouquet 
to `12 was dropped, reverting to the 
earlier price limit of `19. Another key 
proposal to introduce a discount cap 
of 33% on the bouquet price vis a vis 
a-la-carte price was modified, with the 
discount limit increased to 45%. While 
a few appeals were filed against the 
new regulation by some distribution 
platforms, it was implemented in 
February 2023.
Connected TVs – A Promising Growth Opportunity
Key Hindi General 
Entertainment Channels 
moved out of the DD 
Freedish Platform
At the beginning of the year, all the 
major broadcasters took their FTA 
channels off DD Freedish distribution 
platform. This had an impact on 
viewership, up to 90% for some of 
these channels, as they run older 
content which doesn’t get much 
viewership on pay platforms.
Subsequently, it also impacted the ad 
revenue growth for these channels 
and the networks. However, it has 
helped to slow down the loss of 
pay-TV subscribers, an issue which 
has affected the industry since the 
implementation of the New Tariff 
Order (NTO) in early 2019, followed 
20-23% 
CAGR
by the pandemic a year later. Given 
that the quality of content on these 
channels is superior to most of the 
other content available on the FTA 
platform, it provides an incentive for 
consumers to upgrade and become 
pay subscribers.

However, with the fast-increasing adoption of CTVs in India, it is expected 
that advertising spends on the platform will also follow suit. The growth in 
CTV revenue is also expected to be driven by subscription, fuelled by the 
investments in high quality digital content. This is likely to further accelerate 
the adoption of CTV, as viewers seek out big-screen experience for the 
premium content.

creation for its platforms but is also 
leveraging technological innovations to

We firmly believe in the 
long-term growth potential 
of the Indian M&E industry 
as it has a significant 
room for growth, in terms 
of penetration as well as 
monetisation. 
India stands out from 
other countries due to it’s 
linguistic diversity, creating 
a distinct landscape that 
necessitates presence 
across various languages 
to establish a nationwide 
presence. Despite the 
unique characteristics of 
each of these markets, an 
ever-increasing appetite for 
quality content remains a 
constant theme throughout 
the country. 
Digital penetration 
has unlocked a great 
opportunity to reach 
masses with on demand

presents an opportunity to 
reach premium audience at

make investments across

Oil to  
Chemicals
The Oil to Chemicals (O2C) business portfolio spans transportation fuels, 
polymers and elastomers, intermediates and polyesters. The O2C business 
includes world-class assets comprising refineries and petrochemical units 
that are deeply and uniquely integrated across sites along with logistics and 
supply chain infrastructure.
The RIL O2C business includes a 51% equity interest in a fuel retailing 
JV with bp - Reliance BP Mobility Limited (RBML), operating under the brand 
Jio-bp, and a 74.9% equity interest in Reliance Sibur Elastomers Private 
Limited (RSEPL).
The integrated O2C business structure enables an integrated 
decision-making approach that helps to optimise the entire value chain from 
crude to refining to petrochemicals to the B2B/B2C model. The O2C business 
will further leverage technology and its existing assets and streams to 
maximise conversion of crude to chemicals and materials, with an aim to 
create a sustainable, holistic, circular materials business.
Continued recovery in global oil demand and consequent increase in 
product prices propelled the O2C business. High operating rates supported 
by superior product placement partially offset higher feedstock prices and 
volatility, leading to strong performance during the year.

Oil to Chemicals
FY 2022-23 was a year of high 
volatility and uncertainty in oil markets 
amid higher geopolitical tensions due 
to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
This led to significant rise in oil prices 
in the year with Brent crude reaching 
$123.7/bbl in June 2022. 
Europe imposed an embargo on 
imports of Russian crude oil and 
refined products in December 2022 
and February 2023 respectively. These 
European sanctions further led to 
re-routing of global crude and product 
trade flows.
Global oil demand continued to rise 
in FY 2022-23 despite being impacted 
by high oil prices, China’s Covid 
lockdowns during the first half of the 
year, and global economic growth 
concerns during the second half of 
the year.
International air travel rose steadily 
throughout the year as most countries 
lifted restrictions with covid related 
concerns receding. Global refinery 
operations also increased on support 
of rising demand. Improving mobility 
and gas to oil switching, amid high 
natural gas prices, also supported oil 
demand growth during the year. 
Tightening of monetary policy by 
Central Banks caused concerns on 
economic recovery leading to sharp 
drop in oil prices in March 2023.
Crude Oil Demand 
and Supply
Global Oil demand in CY 2022 
increased by 2.3 mb/d to 99.8 mb/d.
High oil prices and China Covid 
lockdowns limited oil demand growth 
in the year. However, demand growth 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
was supported by improving mobility, 
rising air travel demand, increasing use 
of oil for power generation and gas to 
oil switching in the industrial sector.
Global oil supply increased by 4.5 mb/d 
to 99.9 mb/d in CY 2022. Oil supply 
growth was strong in the year in both 
OPEC and Non-OPEC countries. OPEC 
supply growth was led by Saudi Arabia, 
UAE and Iraq. Non-OPEC supply 
growth was led by US.
Global Refining Operations
During FY 2022-23, Global refinery 
operations increased steadily on the 
back of strong demand, high refinery 
margins and also due to start-up 
of new refineries in Middle East, US 
and China.
In CY 2022, global refinery throughput 
was 1.9 mb/d higher than in CY 2021. 
Overall refinery utilisation reached 82% 
by March 23. Refiners increased run 
rates to take advantage of the higher 
product cracks.
Refining margins were strong in 
FY 2022-23 as concerns of loss of 
Russian product exports to Europe due 
to sanctions led to huge disruption in 
global trade flows. Margins were healthy 
in the year mainly due to strong middle 
distillate cracks amid rising fuel demand 
and lower global inventories.

Crude Oil, LNG and Ethane Prices
Oil Prices
Crude oil prices rose sharply in 
FY 2022-23 with Brent price averaging 
$96.2/ bbl in the year. Higher crude 
oil prices during February 2022 to 
August 2022 were mainly on account 
of war premium as an after effect 
of Russia Ukraine conflict. Brent oil 
rose to high levels of $123.7/bbl in 
June 2022 amid rising demand and on 
concerns of impact of upcoming EU 
embargo on Russian oil imports from 
December 2022. However, Oil prices 
started to cool down after June 2022 
as US increased SPR oil sales and 
Russia was able to divert much of its 
crude oil exports from Europe to Asia.
Oil price volatility continued through 
the year with Brent oil prices falling 
to $81.1/ bbl in December 2022 on 
recessionary concerns while Russian 
oil exports remained resilient. China

LNG Prices
During the year, LNG prices were 
highly volatile, with Asian prices 
ranging from a high of $71.25/MMBtu 
in April 2022 to a low of $12.10/
MMBtu in March 2023. Asian LNG 
prices averaged at $32.96/MMBtu in 
FY 2022-23. 
Geopolitical tensions reduced pipeline 
gas flow from Russia to Europe leading 
to decrease in European inventories 
by Q1 2022. Also, significant outages 
at LNG terminals like USA, Australia, 
Malaysia tightened LNG availability 
during FY 2022-23. 
In anticipation of the winter season, 
despite a tight LNG market, Europe 
acquired an additional 45 MT of LNG 
over and above their 2021 volume 
to substitute Russian pipeline gas to 
build inventory. 
These events resulted in significant 
increase in LNG prices during Q2 2022. 
However, high LNG prices and tight 
COVID restrictions in China led to 
demand destruction in Asia (7%) and 
Europe (13%). 
In addition, the relatively mild winter 
experienced in Europe and Asia 
resulted in sustained high inventories 
towards the end of winter 2022, which 
subsequently contributed to reduction 
of LNG prices by March 2023.

Ethane Prices
In February 2023, Reliance completed 
six years of ethane value chain project. 
The ethane chain acted as a virtual 
pipeline from US to India ensuring 
uninterrupted ethane supply to our 
crackers and providing them feedstock 
security, flexibility and a unique 
competitive advantage.
During the year, ethane prices were 
highly volatile, seeing a high of 68.0 
US cents per gallon (cpg) in June 2022 
and a low of 22.7 cpg in February 2023. 
As ethane prices moved in tandem 
with natural gas prices for most of the 
year, prices peaked in anticipation of 
strong winter and low inventory levels. 
However, the Freeport LNG terminal 
shutdown, rising interest rates and 
milder winter eased ethane prices.

Global Market Environment
Global gasoline demand growth remained steady during the year on rising mobility. In CY 2022, demand recovered to 
97.5% of pre-pandemic levels (CY 2019 levels) to 26.0 mb/d as restrictions on mobility were lifted gradually by various 
countries. China lifted Covid related mobility restrictions in December 2022.
With this being the first complete year 
since FY 2020-21 without any specific 
(pandemic led or otherwise) demand 
disruption in the country, there has 
been healthy growth of petroleum 
products in the country despite 
elevated retail selling prices.
India’s oil demand grew by 10.2% 
and stood at 222.3 MMT. LPG 
demand also maintained an upward 
growth trajectory.
Strong economic traction is 
reflected in the double-digit growth 
demonstrated by gasoil and gasoline 
with demand for both fuels surpassing 
peak demand levels of pre-pandemic 
times. While gasoil demand has grown 
The average price of ethane for FY 2022-23 was 44.4 cpg. Despite relatively 
higher prices, ethane continued to be the preferred as a competitive feedstock in 
the region.
Global diesel demand was strong 
during the year due to improving 
economy and rising industrial activity. 
In CY 2022, diesel demand recovered 
to pre-pandemic levels to reach 
28.3 mb/d. 
Jet fuel demand gradually increased 
through the year. It recovered to 78% 
of pre-pandemic levels in CY 2022 
to 6.2 mb/d amid slow recovery in 
business and international travel.

Environment
Indian transportation fuel market has 
bounced back completely to register 
new highs across both HSD and 
MS segment in FY 2022-23. Despite 
being significantly below pre-covid 
levels, ATF volumes have shown the 
steepest growth.
by 12%, gasoline has grown back at 
13% on Y-o-Y basis.
Despite the slowdown concerns of 
previous year, both state-owned oil 
marketing companies and private 
players have continued expanding 
their network, adding over 4,000 
outlets in FY 2022-23, and taking the 
total number of retail outlets in India 
to over 90,000.
Buoyant economic activity in the 
country, consistent growth in 2w and 
4w sales, continued enhancement 
of road infrastructure and increase 
in retail outlet network augurs well 
for maintaining the momentum in 
transportation fuels demand growth in 
the country over the coming decade.

The Electric Vehicle market in India 
scaled up significantly in FY 2022-23 
with 6,600+ charging stations and 
cumulative country-wide EV’s of 
2.7 Mn.
Building on the steady growth shown 
largely on back of domestic travel, 
Aviation industry has grown by more 
than 47% in FY 2022-23. This is on 
the back of unleashing of pent-up 
travel demand both within India and 
outside due to lockdown concerns 
over the last few years. That the 
growth is coming despite churn and 
consolidation amongst the airline 
players augurs well for sustained 
growth of Indian Aviation sector.
Margins
Gasoline margins rose to $14.7/
bbl in FY 2022-23 from $11.4/bbl in 
FY 2021-22 backed by steady demand 
growth and improving mobility. 
The recovery of transport demand 
post Covid partially offset demand 
loss due to high fuel prices. Limited 
exports from China also supported 
gasoline cracks.
Gasoil margins rose sharply to $40.7/
bbl in FY 2022-23 from $12.3/bbl 
in FY 2021-22 amid strong global 
demand growth on rising economic 
activity. Also, uncertainties around 
Russian diesel supply due to EU 
embargo on Russian products, 
gas to oil switching and low global 
inventories kept gasoil margins strong 
during the year.
Jet fuel cracks rose to $32.9/bbl 
in FY 2022-23 from $9.1/bbl in 
FY 2021-22. Jet fuel margins increased 
on support of steady demand growth

Polymers and Elastomers
Global Market Environment
Global polymer demand in CY 2022 
was stable at 245 MMT on Y-o-Y 
basis. Global polyethylene (PE) 
demand grew by 0.3%, polypropylene 
(PP) demand remained flat, while PVC 
demand contracted by 3.4% in CY 
2022. Growth in global demand for 
Styrene Butadiene Rubber (E-SBR) 
was 4% and Polybutadiene Rubber 
(PBR) was 2% in FY 2022-23 on the 
back of automotive sector demand. 
Global Cracker Operations: Global 
Ethylene demand increased by 2% Y-o-Y 
to 183 MMT in CY 2022 against 8% 
Y-o-Y growth in CY2021. New capacity 
addition of 10 MMTA in CY2022 
resulted in lower operating rates at 85% 
compared to 86% in CY2021.
Ethane and Naphtha Prices: 
US Ethane average prices increased by 
27% Y-o-Y from 35 cpg to 44 cpg in 
FY 2022-23, led by higher Natural gas 
prices. Naphtha average prices in Asia 
were down by 3% Y-o-Y from $718/MT 
to $696/MT, due to lower demand 
from Petrochemicals.
Domestic Market Environment
PP domestic market demand grew 
by 6% on Y-o-Y basis on account 
of healthy demand from health & 
hygiene sector and Biaxially Oriented 
Polypropylene (BOPP) packaging. 
PE demand registered 8% growth 
Y-o-Y basis majorly driven by pipes, 
insulation, e-commerce, FMCG and 
liquid packaging. PVC demand grew 
by 32% Y-o-Y, driven by growth in 
construction activities and policy 
boost for several water and sewage 
pipeline projects.
Indian PBR market grew by 7% Y-o-Y, 
while SBR market declined by 1%. 
Margins
Polymer prices weakened during 
FY 2022-23 amidst lower demand 
from China due to COVID related 
restrictions including recessionary 
concerns in major developed markets. 
Global operating rate for PP, PE and 
PVC averaged 81%, 83% and 79% 
respectively during CY2022, lower 
than CY2021. Polymer margins 
weakened during the year as product 
prices declined more than feedstock 
prices. Integrated PP-Naphtha, HDPE-
Naphtha and PVC margins contracted 
by 32%, 15% and 17% respectively 
during the year.
Intermediates and Polyesters
Global Market Environment
Global demand for intermediates 
(PX/PTA/MEG) increased marginally 
by 1% to 159 MMT in CY 2022 from 
157 MMT in CY 2021, as markets 
remained under pressure due to 
volatility in crude prices, high energy 
costs and weak demand in China. 
PX demand grew marginally by 2% 
while supply remained tight due to 
production cut by few PX producers 
amidst unfavorable economics. PTA 
demand marginally reduced by 1% 
to 75 MMT in CY2022 due to high 
inventory of Polyester products 
in China and weak downstream 
demand. MEG witnessed flat 
demand at 33 MMT in CY2022. 
MEG operating rates dropped from 
66% to 58% in CY2022 with higher 
capacity additions.
Polyester overall global demand 
remained flat at 85 MMT in CY2022 
amid inflationary concerns. Global 
polyester markets were under pressure 
as demand weakened in China due 
to Covid related restrictions. Western 
markets too witnessed lacklustre 
demand on account of high inflation 
and slowdown in economic activities.
Domestic Market Environment
Intermediates demand improved by 
4% on account of continued recovery 
in textile and polyester demand. 
Overall Polyester demand grew by 
14% in FY 2022-23. PET witnessed 
strong growth of 28% followed by 
PSF 17% and PFY 10%. Demand 
revived strongly on account of 
resumption of normalcy in schools, 
offices, festive and marriage related 
celebrations and increase in tourism 
activity post removal of Covid related 
restrictions. High cotton prices aided 
usage conversion from cotton to 
polyester globally.
Margins
In FY 2022-23, PX prices improved 
by 16%, while PX-Naphtha margins 
surged by 63% surpassing the 5-year 
average of $303/MT. Integrated 
producers continued to optimise 
production based on PX vs. 
Gasoline economics.
PTA market in China was impacted 
due to weak downstream demand. 
PTA producers responded by 
moderating operating rates and

New Innovative Fabric Launch
R|Elan™ Cotluk – A fabric that is 
smarter than cotton
Cotton has been a key raw material 
for the textile industry. Though the 
textile industry faces some major 
challenges such as low productivity 
and volatile price fluctuations when 
they use cotton as a raw material. 
The impact of wide price fluctuations 
has its negative impact on both – 
the textile value chain and the end 
consumers. RIL, with its extensive 
R&D, has developed a smarter 
alternative to cotton by introducing 
R|Elan™ Cotluk fabric. With volatility 
in cotton availability, it is extremely 
important to have a superior 
alternative with cotton-like attributes. 
R|Elan™ Cotluk, offers cotton-like look 
and feel, becomes an apt alternative 
as it is a perfect material for making 
high-quality knits and woven apparel 
across categories like Casual Knits, 
Denims, Formal wear etc. R|Elan™ 
Cotluk also has superior features like 
excellent strength, durability and 
easy care.
Empowering the Green Fashion 
Revolution
Keeping in mind the ever-increasing 
demand from consumers for 
sustainable products, R|Elan™ Cotluk 
is also made available from recycling 
100% post-consumer used PET bottles 
as R|Elan™ GreenGold Cotluk. Cotluk 
is also available for the home textile 
category under the brand name 
Recron® Cotluk that can be used across 
varied applications like Bedsheets, 
Cushion Covers, Curtains, Towels, 
etc. Thus, R|Elan™ keeps its promise 
by consistently offering smart fabric 
solutions using extensive technical 
knowhow and cutting-edge technology.

E&P
The key focus of the E&P business has been safe and reliable 
operations and project delivery while maximising the production 
from the deepwater and CBM fields.
The production has been ramped up to 20 MMSCMD from the 
R & Satellite Cluster fields. With the commissioning of the MJ field 
in 1Q FY 2023-24, the KG D6 block will produce ~1 BCFe/day by 
FY 2023-24, thereby contributing ~30% of India’s gas production.
This will significantly reduce the dependence on costly imported 
gas and bridge the gap in India’s energy requirements especially 
in times of geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply.
The focus of the E&P business continues to be on safeguarding the 
health and safety of the people and assets while simultaneously 
augmenting gas production. Incremental Gas production from 
MJ field along with production from KG D6 Block is expected to deliver 
~30 MMSCMD in FY 2023-24.

2022 was another volatile year for 
global oil markets on account of 
unprecedented challenges. At the 
start of the year, strong oil demand 
growth was expected as the economy 
continued its recovery from the global 
pandemic. However, Russia-Ukraine 
conflict introduced huge geopolitical 
uncertainties and caused energy 
prices to soar.
Global oil demand in CY 2022 grew 
over 2 million b/d from 2021 but 
remained below pre-pandemic levels.
The Brent crude oil price averaged 
$96.2/bbl in FY 2022-23 and the WTI 
spot price averaged $95/bbl. Oil prices 
rose significantly in the first half of 
2022 due to geopolitical tension but 
declined in the second half of the year.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Natural gas witnessed record high 
prices in 2022 due to steep decline 
in Russian piped gas supply to 
Europe, higher gas burn in the power 
sector and strong storage injections. 
Europe TTF spot prices averaged a 
record high of $38/MMBtu in 2022 
while Henry Hub prices averaged 
$6/MMBtu, their highest level 
since 2008. Asian spot LNG prices 
also averaged $32.96/MMBtu for 
FY 2022-23 which is highest level 
on record.
Record high gas prices led to 
an unprecedented reduction in 
gas demand in industry in 2022. 
Gas consumption declined by an 
estimated 2% in Asia and 13% in 
Europe (over 70 BCM). United States 
experienced growth of 5.4% in gas 
consumption largely due to colder 
than average temperatures during the 
heating season.
LNG demand was dominated by a 
sharp surge in gross LNG imports 
into Europe, which was balanced 
by a steep decline in the rest of the 
world, particularly in Asia. LNG supply 
growth was relatively modest in 2022 
at 5.5%, despite an unprecedented rise 
in LNG demand in Europe following 
the gradual decline in Russian pipeline 
gas deliveries throughout the year.
The Govt. of India appointed Dr. Kirit 
Parikh Committee to review domestic 
natural gas pricing. The Committee 
recommended removal of price ceiling 
on gas produced from High Pressure 
High Temperature (HPHT) fields from 
January 1, 2026.
PERFORMANCE UPDATE  F

Revenues and EBITDA were up 
120.3% and 149.0% respectively. 
This was mainly due to higher price 
realisation along with increase in 
the gas production as compared to 
FY 2021-22.

Update on Arbitrations and 
Other Legal Issues
KG D6 Cost Recovery 
Arbitration
Arbitration claim commenced by the 
Company in November 2011 seeking 
declaration that it is entitled to recover 
100% of its contract costs under the 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) 
for the KG D6 Block. The matter is at 
the stage of Final Hearing as part of 
arbitration proceedings. Government 
of India has filed an application before 
the Arbitration Tribunal alleging that 
majority of the Tribunal members 
are biased and cannot continue 
hearing the dispute. The Arbitration 
Tribunal has reserved its decision on 
Government’s bias application.
Public Interest 
Litigations (PILs)
Three PILs were filed before the 
Supreme Court in 2013 against the 
Company in relation to the KG D6 
PSC, seeking reliefs in the nature 
of disallowance of cost recovery, 
quashing GOI’s decision to approve 
certain gas price formula and 
termination of PSC. The Company has 
submitted that the underlying issues 
in the PILs are already subject matter 
of ongoing arbitrations relating to the 
KG D6 Block. Matter is still pending in 
the Supreme Court.
PMT Arbitration
Arbitration was initiated by BG 
Exploration and Production 
India Limited and the Company 
(together the Claimants) against 
the Government of India (GOI) on 
December 16, 2010 under PSCs, for 
Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks 
due to difference in interpretation 
of certain PSC provisions between 
Claimants and Government. 
The Arbitral Tribunal by majority 
issued a final partial award (‘2016 
FPA’), and separately, two dissenting 
opinions in the matter on October 12, 
2016. Claimants challenged certain 
parts of the 2016 FPA before the 
English Courts, which delivered 
its judgment on April 16, 2018 and 
remitted one of the challenged issues 
back to the Arbitral Tribunal for 
reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal 
decided in favour of the Claimants in 
large part vide its final partial award 
dated October 1, 2018 (‘2018 FPA’). 
The Government and Claimants 
filed an appeal before the English 
Commercial Court against this 2018 
FPA. The English Commercial Court 
rejected Government’s challenges 
to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ 
challenge in February 2020 and 
remitted the underlying issue in 
challenge back to the Arbitration 
Tribunal for determination. Tribunal 
gave favorable award on January 29, 
2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case 
Award”).
Government challenged the EPOD 
Agreements Case Award before 
the English High Court which was 
dismissed on June 9, 2022 by Judge, 
Sir Ross Cranston. Claimants have 
filed an application before the Arbitral 
Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC 
Cost Recovery Limits and the same is 
sub-judice. 
Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule 
the final re-computation of accounts 
and the quantification phase of the 
arbitration, which will take place post 
determination of Claimants’ request 
for increase in cost recovery limit 
under the PSCs.
The Government has also filed an 
execution petition before the Hon’ble 
Delhi High Court under sections 
47 and 49 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 
151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 
seeking enforcement and execution 
of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the 
judgments of English High Court and 
the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The 
Claimants contend that Government’s 
Execution Petition is not maintainable.

Education
Newly constructed 
classrooms
On the request of authorities, new 
classrooms constructed in Gadimoga 
High School to cater to the needs 
of increasing number of school 
going children.
New Technologies
RIL is engaged in R&D efforts 
to increase recovery from CBM 
fields. The current focus of this 
research is Bio-CBM.
The Bio-CBM technology uses 
microbe injection to produce 
in-situ methane in places where 
either the coals are devoid of 
methane or conventional CBM 
extraction is uneconomical.
Several microbial consortia were 
isolated from various locations 
within India and screened for 
methane production potential. 
The best consortium was 
optimised under bottle and 
scale up conditions. Besides this, 
the commercially available coal 
specific synthetic consortia were 
evaluated and have shown very 
high methane productivity
To mimic some of the field 
conditions, a core flood reactor 
was designed and built. The 
isolated microbial consortia as 
well as the synthetic consortia 
were tested successfully for 
their ability to produce methane 
under low porosity and high-
pressure conditions in this 
reactor. Other variables such as 
coal size, recirculation of media 
and nutrient augmentation were 
also tested successfully in the 
core flood reactor.
Lab tests and preliminary field 
trials have shown encouraging 
results with respect to methane 
production potential. Research 
work is underway to establish 
ability of this technology to scale 
up to a commercial operation.
RIL is leveraging its infrastructure 
(advance laboratories), requisite 
diverse inter-disciplinary technical 
skills, CBM production expertise, 
CBM fields and knowledge 
of regulatory requirements 
to give impetus to the Bio-
CBM research.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Risk Description
Climate change continues to feature in the top 10 global risks cited by the Global Risk Report 2023. Global warming 
is having a compounding effect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further 
straining already stretched fiscal balances. 
For businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as 
outlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term 
extreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition 
risks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system 
which includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, 
and changes in stakeholder attitudes.

RISKS AND RESPONSE
Physical Risk
Throughout the year, an array of 
climate change induced weather 
events was experienced around 
the globe and in India too. These 
calamities included extreme weather 
events like intense heatwaves, 
cyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, 
and others, affecting almost every 
region of the country and causing 
unprecedented levels of destruction. 
Having a wide geographical spread, 
the organisation is susceptible to 
such erratic weather phenomenon 
which could cause disruptions in 
its operations and supply chains, in 
addition to causing negative impact 
on the wellbeing of our people and 
our assets.
Transition Risk
Risks Related to Policies, Law and 
Regulations
Driven by ongoing geopolitical 
tensions and the urgency to act on 
climate change, a new global energy 
order is emerging - leading to a 
shift in the way energy is produced 
and consumed. This gradual move 
away from fossil fuels is prompting 
an increased focus on developing 
policies, incentives and regulatory 
frameworks that can bolster the 
adoption of low-carbon technologies 
and green products - which may 
impact the demand for RIL ’s current 
products. Additionally, the envisaged 
development of a domestic carbon 
market regime and thereby the likely 
introduction of stricter regulations 
related to GHG emissions may impact 
RIL ’s operating costs.

I S F
Additionally, long term changes 
in climate patterns causing rising 
temperatures and sea levels 
may also expose our operations 
to future impacts of worsening 
climate change, which can impact 
our business continuity in certain 
vulnerable regions.
Risk Response
Reliance has robust business 
continuity management plans 
to manage risks arising from the 
physical impacts of climate change 
events. Each business segment 
after thorough evaluation of risks 
and its impact, develops these plans 
to ensure uninterrupted availability 
or swift recovery of essential 
business processes, resources and 
operations. Regular review and 
testing are undertaken to ensure 
the effectiveness.
The Global Corporate Security 
(GCS) team focuses on adopting 
pre-emptive, de-risking strategies 
to safeguard and secure operations 
from disasters, natural calamities, and 
any other disruptions or incidents at 
RIL. Digital Services has established 
an integrated process for Disaster 
Recovery and Emergency Response 
to ensure network functionality 
and uninterrupted customer 
services. Retail has also developed 
comprehensive plans for disaster 
recovery and incident response to 
guarantee business continuity during 
any potential disruptions or incidents.
Risk Response
Reliance continues to focus on 
energy management and resource 
optimisation to reduce its carbon 
footprint through adoption of data 
analytics, advanced process controls 
and optimisation models. It is 
proactively shifting its dependence on 
fossil fuels to renewable alternatives 
like solar, biomass etc. to meet 
its captive energy demand. The 
Company also has plans to establish 
20 GW of solar energy generation 
capacity by 2025, which will be 
consumed for captive round-the-
clock (RTC) power and will also serve 
as intermittent energy for Green 
Hydrogen production. 
Reliance is committed to scaling up 
responsible consumption practices 
and maximising circularity across 
its value chain through sustained 
investments in R&D of innovative 
technologies and solutions. By 
keeping resources in use for longer, 
our circular business models can help 
to reduce the demand for new raw 
materials and the associated carbon 
emissions from their extraction, 
transportation and processing. These 
initiatives are enabling us to minimise 
our impact on the environment 
and thereby mitigate the regulatory 
risks that may arise from a high 
carbon liability.
Market Risk
With the increasing number of 
customers embracing clean energy 
and materials, the demand for 
conventional products is likely to 
reduce, which may potentially impact 
the company’s revenue and profits.
Risk Response
The Company has integrated 
climate-related issues into its strategic 
planning, investment reviews, 
risk management processes, and 
long-range supply and demand 
forecasts. As reflected in its adoption 
of a long-term perspective on the 
transition to green energy, Reliance 
has set a bold and forward-looking 
vision to establish itself as a leading 
global player in the New Energy 
and New Materials industry. The 
company’s 15-year plan entails a 
multi-pronged approach to creating 
sustainable energy sources and 
futuristic materials for India’s future, 
while advancing the development of 
cutting-edge technologies to convert 
CO2 emissions into useful products, 
use CO2 as feedstock and develop 
next-gen carbon capture and storage 
technologies, in line with its focus on 
sustainability and innovation.
With a plan to invest around H 
75,000 crore over a span of 3 years, 
Reliance aims to:
• Establish and enable 100 GW of 
solar energy by 2030.
• Build five Giga factories namely the 
integrated solar photovoltaic module 
factory, an advanced energy storage 
battery factory, an electrolyser 
factory, a fuel cell factory, and a

globally in Solar, Battery, and 
Electrolyser space.
• Focus on bioenergy, offshore wind, 
and other non-conventional sources.
• Maximise crude to chemicals 
integration and create a portfolio of 
advanced and speciality materials.
• Transform RIL ’s business into Net 
Carbon Zero operations.
Once proven at scale, RIL is prepared 
to double the investment to scale up 
its manufacturing ecosystem.
In addition, Reliance is also engaging 
in R&D initiatives and taking concrete 
measures to enable transformation 
in its value chain. For instance, RIL 
along with Ashok Leyland developed 
this unique technology of India’s first 
Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine 
(H2-ICE) powered heavy duty truck.
Through these strategic initiatives, RIL 
aims to not only mitigate the negative

Risk Response
RIL ’s strategy has been to source 
feedstocks from diverse sources to 
ensure supply security. Accordingly, 
RIL has long term contracts with 
various Middle East National Oil 
Companies, African and Latin 
American countries. It has also entered 
into term contracts with Canadian 
companies to source heavy crude oil. 
Reliance has a robust ship tanker fleet, 
which is suitable to trade worldwide. 
This set of time charter ships was 
optimally and proactively utilised along 
with ships from the spot markets 
achieving smooth and timely cargo 
evacuation and by limiting exposure to 
freight cost.

• Enhancing customer experience 
with localised support
• Structured process of measuring 
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) 
across all touchpoints.
The liquid tanker shipping markets has 
never seen such demand before. The 
challenge was to find suitable ships 
at commercially viable cost. This was 
managed by tight monitoring of the 
time charter ships multiple scheduling 
until the last minute for the best and 
optimum route for the time charter 
ships, while ensuring nil downtime 
(100% utilisation) basis ship and cargo 
availability and at the same time

Risk and Governance
Technology Risks
As Reliance is shifting to explore 
newer business avenues in cleaner 
technologies, there are inherent 
risks and costs for scaling up novel 
technologies to their full potential.
Risk Response
Reliance is leveraging the expertise 
and experience of its New Energy 
Council (NEC), a group of leading 
global technocrats and thought 
leaders, to accelerate its transition to 
clean energy. NEC is enabling creation 
of a strong foundation to realise 
our vision of New Energy business 
– its strategic advice on innovative 
technologies and partnerships will 
help us mitigate the risks posed in 
these novel areas.
Reputational Risk
Growing concerns about climate 
change and increased momentum 
towards Net Carbon Zero could 
result in higher expectations from 
society and investors to address the 
environmental impact. Failure to meet 
these expectations could lead to 
damage to the company’s reputation, 
which could impact RIL ’s ability to 
access capital, as well as to attract and 
retain talent.
Risk Response
Reliance is closely monitoring the 
progress of its Net Carbon Zero by 
2035 target including realisation of its 
near-term targets. We have set interim 
timelines for significant milestones 
across various initiatives within the 
New Energy business. A dedicated 
ESG committee has been instituted 
at the group level to facilitate 
supervision over the implementation 
and review of crucial initiatives, with 
the aim of ensuring progress towards 
the attainment of our Net Carbon 
Zero goals. 
Further, the company recognises the 
significance of effective stakeholder 
engagement, particularly in relation 
to its climate change goals and 
believes that ongoing dialogue 
with its stakeholders is essential to 
ensure alignment with the company’s 
objectives for a sustainable future.
With focus on research and 
technological innovation, 
strong fundamentals and deep 
understanding and knowledge of 
chemistry and materials that adds 
to our competitive edge. Reliance 
is well positioned to manage, risks 
while creating opportunities in the 
coming decades. 
Risk Description
The Russia Ukraine conflict and consequent US and EU sanctions on Russian crude oil, product and natural gas 
exports have the potential for creating shortages of crude oil and products and driving up prices. This can impact 
the availability of crude oil and cause a spike in price of feedstock.
The high energy inflation could lead to headwinds for the global economy affecting oil demand and 
refining margins.
There was unforeseen market scenario with a disruption of energy sources and oil supply mainly in the western 
regions due to geo-political developments between neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Russia. This has 
resulted in a shift in sourcing of energy and oil from alternate destinations, which has led to change in the 
trade-flows worldwide.
The resultant longer sea passage has created shortage of availability of tankers and thus historically high volatility in 
freight rates.
Further, the phased embargoes of Russian products that has come into place has created challenges which are likely 
to continue to be more complex for transportation of food and energy worldwide.
Non availability of goods at right price, quality and quantity can adversely affect our retail business. There are 
several variables that may impact procurement decisions such as stock limits imposed by Government, adverse 
monsoon which may impact commodity prices, international geo-political events such as Russia – Ukraine war.
Risk Description
Digital Services being a customer oriented business, any sub-optimal customer experience may result in customer 
dissatisfaction and increased chances of churn.
Evolving habits and changing customer preferences could weaken our value proposition and in turn could lead to low 
loyalty and repeat purchases from customers.
Reliance Retail could lose customers or incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers which can impact our reputation

Risk Description
The ability to attract people, develop and retain talent is one of most critical factors for enabling smooth operations 
within our business. Given the scale and breadth of our operations, retaining talented personnel is imperative and a 
source of competitive advantage for the business.
Talent to Support Scaling Business Impact on:  H , all businesses
Data Privacy Risk Impact on:  I , all businesses
Risk Description
Data has undoubtedly become a key pillar in this digital economy where every interaction results in generation of 
massive datasets. This data is consumed and used by businesses for providing customised experiences, helping 
shape new business models and driving a customer-centric service environment in this competitive market. This 
also brings challenges to organisations in ethically handling such data. The rising number of data breaches is the 
greatest concern for organisations of every size and scale.
Due to the large-scale digitisation and expansion of B2C businesses, the handling of personal data of customers, 
consumers, employees, partners, and service providers transparently and securely becomes of utmost importance. 
Improper handling and inadequate data protection practices may lead to data breaches and non-compliance with 
laws and regulations.
Risk Response
Reliance has adopted an approach of 
being proactive and at the same time 
being resilient to manage cyber risk. 
The Cyber Security strategy defined 
at Reliance is based on Mark to Threat 
and is aligned to business as well 
as technology.
Security by design principle and 
shift left strategy is followed across 
the lifecycle of the digital platforms 
to ensure that cyber security 
controls are part of the design. The 
cyber-attack surface is continuously 
monitored to identify vulnerabilities 
or misconfigurations and identified 
weaknesses are fixed on priority.
Contemporary and state-of-the-art 
security technologies and processes 
are deployed for protection against 
emerging attacks at multiple layers. 
Intelligence-driven Cyber Defense 
operations are performed for 
proactive threat detection. Rapid 
response playbooks are in place 
and updated regularly for cyber 
incident management.
Third-party risk management 
processes are in place to manage 
and minimise the impact of supply 
chain attacks.
At RIL, special attention is paid to 
Cyber Security awareness and to 
foster a culture of Cyber security 
as humans have turned out to be 
the best defenses to combat cyber 
threats. Innovative solutions such as 
R-phish are deployed to improve user 
awareness levels by tracking their 
Phishing Resistance Score levels.
Cybersecurity awareness month 
is observed every year with a 
context-based campaign. The context 
for this year was “Fostering a culture 
of cyber security”. During this month 
we have also released a “Cyber 
Suraksha Handbook” for all the users. 
This handbook acts as a guide to 
stay safe online in the digital era and 
contains cyber safety guidelines for 
Work Place, Digital Life, teens and 
kids, and protection of Personal data.
Cyber Security practices followed 
at RIL are benchmarked against 
Industry Best standards such as NIST, 
ISO 27001, etc. RIL ’s O2C and Retail 
businesses are ISO 27001 certified 
whereas Retail and RBML businesses 
have attained PCI DSS certification. 
Reliance is the only organised and 
multi-brand retail business in the 
country to demonstrate PCI DSS 
certification continuously for the last 
10 years.
Cybersecurity Risk Impact on:  I , all businesses
Risk Description
RIL has always been at the forefront of using cutting-edge technologies for bringing more efficiency into businesses. 
Digital transformation is thus an ongoing activity in Reliance. The pace of digital transformation has been increasing 
over the years. One of the consequences of such rapid digital transformation is the expansion of cyber-attack 
surfaces. Cybersecurity risk is thus emerging as one of the prominent business risks.
Cybercrime and Cyber Insecurity is considered as one of the severe global risks as per the World Economic Forum’s 
Global Risk Report 2023 making it clear that cyber risks will remain a constant and significant concern over the next 
decade. Cyber Attacks today are more sophisticated, persistent, and disruptive in nature. Geo-political influences are 
magnifying the risks to critical infrastructure. Adversaries are leveraging emerging technologies such as AI etc. to 
initiate cyber-attacks on organisations that typically evade the existing defenses.

Safety and Operational Risks
Impact on:  H  M  N , all businesses
Multiple layers of proactive and 
reactive controls are adopted for 
Digital Services to mitigate the 
vulnerabilities. All systems and 
security tools are monitored for any 
cyberattacks via a 24x7 Security 
Operations Centre. Continuous 
Improvement programs are 
implemented to improve the maturity 
and the cyber security posture of the 
organisation. Additionally, Reliance 
also ensures that the cyber security 
posture is validated by third-party 
experts periodically to obtain 
additional layers of assurance.
Cyber Security Posture update is 
made to the Board Risk Management 
Committee at regular intervals and 
their guidance is taken to further 
improve on the posture.
Risk Description
Managing HSE risks including short term, long-term effects to workforce, assets and public is critical to sustainable 
and responsible conduct of business operations. These risks may manifest during various phases of facility life cycle 
and vary in the magnitude depending on the geographic, demographic and regulatory regimes where we operate. 
Risks may also present themselves through external factors with an impact to company’s personnel and assets, like 
external events in the neighbouring industries and natural calamities. 
With rapid-changes in the HSE regulatory requirement due to evolving global trends, changes in legal and regulatory 
framework, ask from investors, and customer awareness, it is compelling to stay abreast of these requirements 
for smooth operations and business continuity. The health risk is not only restricted to occupational health but 
also covers mental health of the workforce. The environment regulations are evolving, and becoming stringent for 
businesses due to risk of global warming and climate change risk. Safety risk is not only restricted to site operations 
but also require to capture risk across the upstream and downstream supply chain for business continuity.
Risk Response
Reliance’s motto of ‘Growth is Life’ 
has always been reinforced with 
our commitment on conducting 
safe, reliable, compliant and 
sustainable operations.
There has been a continuous 
endeavour to manage risks across 
our existing assets at Exploration & 
Production, Refining & Marketing, 
Petrochemicals, Polyester and other 
dispersed facilities through world-class 
HSE management practices. 
Implementation of advanced 
technologies like video analytics, 
robotics, remote-sensing devices for 
inspection have reduced personnel 
exposure to hazardous environment.
Our People are our critical assets 
in managing HSE risks. We have 
invested significant efforts in 
developing and maintaining 
in-house competencies which are 
critical to manage Safety, including 
managing Integrity Operating 
Window, advanced techniques of 
risk assessment, deep-dive technical 
analysis techniques and functional 
safety. This talent pool helps execute 
risk and control studies and provides 
assurance with agility, while leveraging 
industry expertise.
Our HSE risks and controls are 
maintained through digital platforms 
enabling traceability and transparency 
of information to all concerned 
workforce for effective prioritisation 
and decision making.
Our involvement in regulatory 
bodies in setting HSE standards and 
participation in international and 
national HSE forums further aids in 
imbibing High Value Learnings in 
conducting our operations. Reliance’s 
strong framework of auditing, 
assurance and third-party verification 
ensures effective governance of 
these practices.
With the diversification of operations 
towards Oil to Chemicals and 
New Energy, this year presented 
new opportunities to embed HSE 
management best practices in 
the novel technologies since the 
conceptual stage itself. This involved 
strategic partnerships with industry 
experts, application of scientific 
methods to analyse the risks in the 
new units and devising advanced 
technologies for risk mitigation.
Our flagship CASHE program has 
seen continuity for 20th year with 
massive involvement of asset facing 
teams and entire workforce in 
execution of ideas to improve Safety, 
Health and Environment.
Health of workforce including mental 
well-being has been a priority, with 
programmes organised through 
internal and external experts to 
provide support to workforce 
operating across locations.
Health and Safety Management 
System (HSMS) is developed and 
deployed with robust governance 
mechanism with an aim to identify, 
assess, respond and monitor, on 
a real-time basis, risks that impact 
business objectives.
The Retail Health and safety 
management system (HSMS) has 
been certified with ISO 45001:2018, 
an internationally recognised standard 
for Occupational Health and Safety 
management system. It recognises 
the best-implemented framework 
adopted by the organisation 
for identifying and managing 
occupational health and safety risks, 
improve performance, and promote 
culture of continual improvement.
Also, the approach and initiatives 
implemented in the business has been 
recognised by British Safety Council 
with “International Safety Award”. 
Retail Business was also conferred 
with “Road safety award” Gold with 
4 stars at 7th OHSSAI HSE Excellence 
and Sustainability Awards for 
demonstrating a strong commitment 
to good road safety management 
programs and “Best ESG Initiative to

Regulatory Compliance Risks
Compliance and Control Risks
Impact on:  M  S , all businesses
Risk Description
Increased regulatory scrutiny has raised the bar on regulatory compliance. This requires alignment of corporate 
performance objectives, with regulatory compliance requirements. COVID-19 has led the government to announce 
a range of notifications which companies need to adopt swiftly and effectively.
Changes in the regulatory environment, licensing processes and timelines could potentially impede the ease of 
doing business.
Risk Response
Reliance has adopted a digitally- 
enabled comprehensive compliance 
management framework. It is 
integrated with business processes, 
risks and controls. Changes in 
regulations are also tracked and 
integrated within the Reliance 
Compliance Management System. 
Effective control and efficient 
oversight of the senior management 
is ensured by cascading the 
responsibility matrix till the last 
performer of the activity. Apart 
from assurance through three 
lines of defense, compliances 
are also periodically monitored 
through the Segment Compliance 
Committees and the Group 
Compliance Committee.
Regular interactions with various 
trade associations/ councils help in 
anticipating regulatory environment 
and through attuning to any 
policy changes.
The Company’s code of conduct, 
training as well as focus on 
ensuring 100% compliance and 
continuous monitoring have 
enabled a mature, digitally-enabled 
compliance framework.

monitoring data at a transaction level 
and providing mitigation strategies to 
business. Close coordination with field 
teams and strong IT footprint gives the 
Risk Description
Our business operations have a vast geographical spread, both onshore as well as offshore. This makes Reliance 
vulnerable to manmade and natural disasters such as insider threat, social unrest, cyclones etc. These threats may 
be amplified by divisive use of social media networks. Geopolitical developments too can have a defining impact on 
business operations. These could cause harm to our assets, people, information and reputation.
Even a seemingly minor incident has the potential to snowball and adversely impact our operations and 
stakeholders. Therefore, having high situational awareness with prompt and commensurate means to effectively 
respond in a proactive manner, is required to deal with all crises. Risk management and Business continuity plans 
are critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted and if compromised, we should have the ability to 
restore the operations at the earliest.
Some of the network locations, offices, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional 
or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and efforts.
The growing E-commerce business is vulnerable to specific risks like Customer abuse (fake returns, related account 
abuse, fake claims - as order not received, empty box, wrong item received etc.), Account compromise, Brand 
infringement, Phishing/Vishing attacks etc. which are likely to increase manifolds. Of these, customer abuse is 
probably the most critical of risks. Fraudsters continue to innovate new methods to bypass system checks on 
Ecom platform/physical processes to defraud. There is thus a need to closely monitor these risks and have a robust 
mitigation strategy to protect business interests.
robustness required for prompt support 
in response to red flags being raised.
Through rigorous data analysis, 
physical audits and investigations, the 
team has been able to identify critical 
gaps in existing processes/systems/
tech issues which lend themselves 
to exploitation on Ecom platform. 
In addition, an online fraud prevention 
service (engine) is also envisaged as 
part of long term solution.

Insurance –  
Risk Mitigation
Corporate Risk Management 
philosophy of RIL inter alia deals 
with protection of unforeseen risks 
by transferring them to insurers. 
While buying the protection through 
insurance, it is always our endeavour 
to have best possible cover on all 
risk basis to meet any eventuality 
which may affect our balance sheet. 
Risk transfer to insurer through 
insurance is used as risk management 
tool for protection of all assets and 
liabilities arising due to business risks. 
A thorough examination is made for 
identification of risk, verification and 
counter verification is done before 
arranging risk protection. Selection 
of partner insurers are done after 
complete verification and is decided 
based on their balance sheet strength 
and solvency ratio.

Treasury Risks
Financial Risks
Impact on:  F , all businesses
Risk Response
RIL maintained healthy liquidity 
buffer as it had raised Long term 
Senior unsecured notes of $4.0 billion 
in January 2022. Even as liquidity 
tightened through the year, RIL 
and its subsidiaries accessed Short 
Term markets comfortably and raise 
short term INR liabilities (including 
Commercial Paper, Short-Term Loans 
and Overdrafts against FDs) to fund 
its working capital requirements. 
Reliance’s Retail business too 
strengthened the liquidity position by 
raising Term Loans to fund its capex 
and business requirements.
Interest rate risk is managed actively 
by maintaining an appropriate mix of 
Fixed and Floating rate liabilities which 
limits the translation of rise in market 
interest rates into higher coupon 
costs of market liabilities. RIL has 
raised significant amount of fixed rate 
liabilities over the FY 2022-23 and 
2H FY 2021-22.
Foreign Exchange (FX) risk arising 
from the mismatch of foreign 
currency assets, liabilities and 
earnings is tracked and managed as 
per the Internal Risk Management 
Framework. A significant portion of 
the payables and receivables of the 
Hydrocarbon business are in dollars 
which minimises the cash flow risk 
on account of fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates.
Direct investments are restricted to 
Board approved select AAA rated 
corporates. Debt Mutual Fund 
investments are managed and 
monitored based on a Internal Risk 
Management Framework.
Risk Description
RIL faces following key financial risks which is actively managed by Treasury Team.
Liquidity Risk
In FY 2022-23, inflation scaled higher in key economic regions of the globe on account of supply chain constraints. 
The onset of Russia Ukraine conflict drove commodity prices and inflation higher. Major central banks embarked on 
liquidity tightening measures through the year as inflation spiralled. On the domestic front too, banking liquidity and 
financial conditions tightened. Central banks are expected to calibrate their monetary stance based on the balance 
of risks of continuing inflation and those of financial stability.
Interest Rate Risk
Reliance borrows funds from Domestic and International markets to meet its funding requirements. Faced with the 
scenario of spiralling inflation, central banks across the globe raised policy rates through the year. US Fed raised 
rates by 450 bps. RBI was also quick to respond to rising inflation in India and raised policy rates by 250 bps. The 
rise in global and domestic rates translates into higher finance costs for RIL.
Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk
RIL avails LT and ST Foreign currency liabilities to fund its capital investments and working capital requirements. 
Rupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. Given the steep rise in US interest 
rates, the Dollar remained strong against most currencies through the year. The INR depreciated sharply through 
first half of the year and closed the year with a depreciation of 8.4%.
Credit Risk on Investment Portfolio
Reliance deploys its investible surplus in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds, 
Fixed Deposits and Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk.
Looking Ahead
Our commitment to sustainable 
development goes beyond 
our operating boundaries. We 
continuously aim to add value to our 
stakeholders by improving lives. We 
are committed to help in bridging 
the Green Energy divide in India and 
the world through our New Energy 
business. We continue to build on our 
leadership in the O2C business with 
new capacities and capabilities. Jio is 
rolling out 5G network across India 
and has developed deep expertise in 
multiple emerging technologies like 
AI/ML and blockchain and Mixed 
Reality. Jio Platforms is blossoming 
into a global technology player to 
provide unique digital products and 
solutions. Reliance Retail has emerged 
as the fastest growing retailers with 
the widest and deepest reach in India, 
across all product baskets. Reliance’s 
risk management enables effective 
management of all categories of risks 
in a shared language understood by 
all levels across the Group, from the 
Board room to front line. Reliance’s 
risk management is agile for course 
correction and is scalable to support 
new businesses and ventures.

Net Zero Strategy
The sheer magnitude of Reliance’s 
Net Carbon Zero target makes 
the associated responsibilities as 
well as opportunities far more 
transformational and global in scope 
than anything the Company has 
ever done before. Reliance has a 
strong legacy of executing numerous 
projects that were unparalleled in 
scale and impact and pioneered 
transformational business models. 
However, the Company always 
believes in getting its first principles 
of business right. 
Today, Reliance’s approach is no 
different, with foundational principles 
underlining the Company’s progress 
towards a 'Net Carbon Zero' future as 
outlined below:
• Hyper-integration: By 
integrating scientific knowledge 
with continuous technological 
innovation to build and operate 
truly integrated systems that deliver 
hyper-performance;
• Robust business model: By 
building a model that catches 
the irreversible upward curve in 
the demand for green, clean and 
renewable energy in India and 
globally; and the downward curve in 
the cost of their production;
• Scale: By improving the efficiency, 
performance and life-cycle of 
its assets and operations to 
achieve total system optimisation 
and economics.
Reliance has made a strong start on the ambitious journey to become 
Net Carbon Zero by 2035. The Company envisions becoming one of the 
world’s leading New Energy and New Materials Company over a period  
of 15 years through a strategic focus on:
Reliance recognises that climate change poses a significant global threat. However, the 
Company also believes that prompt action can provide an opportunity to create a healthier, 
happier, secure, and more resilient future. Consequently, Reliance advocates urgent on-ground 
implementation of action to move beyond dialogue and commit to the global energy 
transition agenda. Based on this vision, Reliance announced its ambition to become Net 
Carbon Zero by 2035.
Accelerating Progress Towards 
a Net Carbon Zero Future
The Reliance Commitment
Reliance is leading the way in designing decarbonisation solutions to build 
a sustainable future for the Company and the nation by embracing new 
technologies and pathways to combat climate change. The Company 
is transforming to build and scale a comprehensive green energy 
ecosystem in India.
As one of the largest energy markets globally, India will play a pivotal 
role in transforming the world’s energy landscape. Reliance is focused on 
growing businesses of the future and making India a stronger economy by 
leveraging its strengths in finance, talent management, technology, and 
project execution capabilities. Reliance sees investments in renewables 
and alternative energy as a proactive step to ensure a sustainable 
tomorrow for future generations. The Company is pivoting its operations 
to play a more relevant role in the renewables and alternative energy 
space as they become the dominating constituents of the future power 
generation mix.

Execution  
Approach and Progress
manufacturing facility by 2024. 
Reliance plans to further scale 
this capacity to 50 GWh annually 
by 2027.
3     Electrolyser Giga Factory 
Reliance is among the largest 
global producers of Grey 
Hydrogen. The Company has 
partnered with Stiesdal to reduce 
costs and commercialise their 
Pressurised Alkaline Electrolyser 
technology. Additionally, 
Reliance is in advanced talks 
with other leading electrolyser 
technology players globally 
to establish a Giga-scale 
electrolyser manufacturing 
facility in Jamnagar. Reliance 
will leverage its complementary 
skills in engineering, operations, 
seawater desalination, digital twin 
expertise, and indigenous balance 
of plants to complement its 
partner’s technological innovation 
in stack manufacturing, enabling 
the delivery of Green Hydrogen 
at the lowest cost. After proving 
cost and performance targets, the 
Company aims to progressively 
commence transition from Grey 
to Green Hydrogen by 2025.
4     Fuel Cell Giga Factory  
Reliance has plans to set up a 
Giga factory for fuel cells which 
are set to gradually replace 
internal combustion engines in 
the future. These engines can 
power various types of vehicles, 
including cars, trucks, and 
buses. Additionally, they can be 
used in stationary applications 
to power data centres, 
telecom towers, emergency 
generators, microgrids, and 
industrial equipment
5     Power Electronics Giga Factory

the Company’s existing strengths 
in Telecommunications, Cloud 
Computing, and IoT platforms, 
enabling a more comprehensive 
approach to developing New 
Energy solutions.
Making CO2 a recyclable 
resource
Reliance is fully committed to the 
transformation of CO2 into a recyclable 
resource, thereby fostering a sustainable 
future. By prioritising innovation, the 
Company is actively engaged in the 
exploration of advanced technologies 
that effectively convert CO2 into 
valuable products.
Reliance’s investments in carbon 
capture and utilisation technology will 
play a pivotal role in utilising CO2 as a 
valuable resource instead of releasing 
it into the atmosphere. The Company

Reliance’s Approach to TCFD
Governance
Strong governance related to climate 
issues underlines Reliance’s efforts 
to address climate change. The 
Company’s Board brings unparalleled 
depth and breadth of experience 
and expertise across leadership, 
operations, strategic planning, 
domains, research and development, 
global business, financial, regulatory/
legal, risk management and corporate 
governance and provides oversight 
of Reliance’s climate-related risks. 
The Board also oversees, reviews 
and guides the Company’s energy 
transition strategy and activities 
to address climate change 
through regular engagement and 
structured discussions.

Reliance is also considering Carbon 
Capture Utilisation and Sequestration 
(CCUS) pathways such as but not 
limited to synthetic fuels and chemicals, 
mineral carbonation in construction 
materials, algae cultivation for biofuels 
and food supplements, and other 
technology-led solutions
A dedicated R&D team actively 
collaborates on national and 
international projects, aiming to 
fully unlock the potential of CO2 
utilisation. Under the Company’s 
flagship programme, Algae to Oil, a 
ground-breaking technology has been 
developed that can transform sunlight, 
CO2, and seawater into renewable 
bio-crude. This revolutionary technology 
holds immense potential for converting 
CO2 into valuable products, thereby 
contributing to the fight against 
climate change.
The R&D team has achieved significant 
milestones, including the development 
of a stable catalyst that efficiently 
converts methanol and CO2 into 
high-value Di-methyl carbonate (DMC) 
products. The process and catalyst 
have been scaled up to the pilot stage. 
Additionally, the team has patented a 
sorbent-based circulating fluidised bed 
process for concentrating CO2 from 
dilute flue gases emitted by refineries 
and power plants.
Replacing Transportation Fuel
Reliance aims to progressively 
replace transportation fuels with 
sustainable alternatives like clean 
electricity and hydrogen. By embracing 
these cleaner energy sources, the 
Company significantly reduces carbon 
emissions and promotes a greener 
transportation sector.
Additionally, Reliance is transitioning 
from traditional transportation fuels 
to chemical building blocks such as 
ethylene, propylene, and aromatics 
that are integrated with downstream 
derivatives. Furthermore, the New 
Energy and New Materials businesses 
are designed to complement traditional 
fuels with clean electricity and 
hydrogen, aiming to achieve an optimal 
mix of reliable, clean, and affordable 
energy and storage using solar, wind, 
and batteries.
To enable this transition, Reliance is 
collaborating with global partners 
to commercialise its world-leading 
proprietary Multi-zone Catalytic 
Cracking (MCC) Technology.
Towards Net Carbon Zero 
Operations
Reliance’s businesses have captive 
energy requirements that generate 
a significant base-load demand, 
supporting the Company’s objective 
to establish Giga-scale manufacturing 
operations. This captive demand 
reinforces the strategic direction 
supporting Reliance’s investment 
of `75,000 crore to create a fully 
integrated New Energy manufacturing 
ecosystem in Jamnagar. Upon 
validating the feasibility of this initiative 
at scale, Reliance is ready to double 
its investment to further scale up 
the manufacturing ecosystem. The 
Company aims to establish 20 GW of 
solar energy generation capacity by 
2025, which will be solely utilised to fulfil 
the captive needs of round-the-clock 
(RTC) power and intermittent energy for 
Green Hydrogen.
The Company has made considerable 
headway in developing photosynthetic 
biological pathways to transform CO₂ at 
Jamnagar into high-value products.
In February 2023, the Company 
unveiled it’s first Hydrogen Internal 
Combustion Engine technology 
for heavy-duty trucks and buses. 
Reliance is also exploring hydrogen 
fuel cell technology solutions, and is 
partnering with auto manufacturers and 
others to create a sustainable future 
for transportation. 
Reliance is committed to advancing 
bio-energy to meet its captive energy 
needs. The Company aims to further 
build on this by leveraging new and 
emerging technologies and innovations. 
In this regard, Reliance inaugurated 
Phase I of its Bio-Energy Technology 
(BET) Centre in Jamnagar on August 15, 
2022, the day India celebrated its 
75th Independence day. The Company 
has already begun using biomass 
extensively as a fuel to produce green 
energy at scale. Within just one year, 
Reliance has replaced almost 5.3% of 
energy consumed at its Dahej and 
Hazira sites with green power and green 
steam. The Company is confident that 
initiatives like these, combined with the 
transition to renewable power for its 
O2C assets, will accelerate its journey 
towards becoming Net Carbon Zero.

Materiality Approach
Reliance operates in dynamic 
environments. The Company 
continually assesses issues that are 
most material to its business and 
stakeholders and prioritises critical 
topics that need to be addressed as 
part of its business activities. Reliance 
conducted a materiality assessment 
for the listed entity in FY 2021-22 
to identify material issues based on 
international reporting standards. 
The assessment also prioritised key 
internal and external stakeholders 
with the most impact and influence 
on Reliance. Relevant stakeholder 
engagement mechanisms were used 
to capture the inputs of the identified 
stakeholders on the potential 
material issues. Each potential 
material issue was analysed in detail, 
taking into account the inputs from 
stakeholders and management. The 
material topics were then prioritised 
based on both management and 
stakeholder perspectives.

the Material Issues
Materiality Assessment Methodology
Material Topic Prioritisation: The 
result of the analysis threw up a list of 
material topics that were considered 
the most material for Reliance based 
on their priority and overall impact.
Peer Benchmarking: A list of industry 
peers and international standards, 
such as GRI and SASB, were identified 
for benchmarking material topics.
Stakeholder Survey: Questionnaires 
were administered and responses were 
garnered from different stakeholder 
groups to understand the impacts of 
the probable material topics.
Stakeholder Response Evaluation: 
Stakeholders’ responses were 
collected and collated, and a detailed

Double Materiality 
As a Company that strongly focuses on integrating the key concerns and needs of its stakeholders into its business and 
sustainability strategy, Reliance has identified double material issues. This will help Reliance evaluate the cross-impact of 
material issues on the environment and society against its impact on the Company. Double materiality assessment will 
allow the Company to recognise the impact of material issues holistically and enhance the transparency and breadth of 
ESG disclosures. 
Material Issue and Associated Capital
  Reliance’s O2C operations have a greater environmental 
impact than its Retail and Telecom businesses. Abating emissions 
from O2C is challenging due to the nature of its activities. Burning 
fossil fuels during O2C operations releases greenhouse gases 
(GHG), resulting in environmental impacts such as air and water 
pollution, habitat destruction, and the release of toxic chemicals.
  Reliance faces several physical and transitional risks related to 
climate change. Physical risks include climate-related events that 
can impact the Company’s financial stability and value creation 
capabilities. Transitional risks stem from changes in the energy 
market as the world progresses towards a more sustainable future 
and embraces cleaner energy forms. Failure to adapt to these 
changes could lead to decreased profitability and stakeholder 
value and regulatory penalties.
Climate Change N
  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People  Impact on the Company
  Reliance’s O2C business has significant environmental 
impacts related to GHG emissions, water use, waste generation, 
ecosystems and biodiversity. In addition, the O2C business can 
negatively impact the health and wellbeing of stakeholders, 
including workers, local communities, and consumers.
  Effective environmental management is important for 
Reliance to comply with regulations, avoid legal risks, and 
maintain a positive reputation. It is, therefore, critical for the 
Company to assess potential risks associated with its operations 
and mitigate them by reducing emissions, minimising water 
use, and preventing waste and pollution. Failure to do so 
could result in legal action, fines, and reputational damage. 
Prioritising environmental sustainability demonstrates Reliance’s 
commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, protecting 
brand reputation and contributing to a more sustainable future.
Managing Environmental Impacts N
  Reliance’s O2C business can have a negative impact 
on biodiversity through various activities such as habitat 
fragmentation, deforestation, and erosion. This can result in 
the loss of habitats for wildlife, as well as cause a decline in the 
diversity and abundance of species.
  Non-compliance with regulations related to land use, 
greenfield expansions, rehabilitation and redevelopment can 
expose the Company to regulatory and legal risks. Hence, it 
becomes imperative for Reliance to work with all stakeholders 
and address ecosystem and biodiversity issues. 
Ecosystem and Biodiversity N
  Impact of the Company on the Environment and People  Impact on the Company
  Reliance’s O2C operations generate high volumes of 
hazardous waste that can negatively impact the environment and 
human health. Reliance Retail and Jio also generate substantial 
waste from the use of paper, plastic, and packaging. Appropriate 
waste management practices are essential to minimise their 
impact on people and the planet. Reliance undertakes various 
initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainability across its 
business segments, such as recycling PET bottles and used PPEs 
and developing and deploying waste-to-road and waste-to-oil 
technology solutions.
  The Company generates various forms of waste from the 
processing and storage of petroleum products. Many of these 
substances are hazardous to human health and the environment 
and may be subject to regulations. Reliance O2C unit reduces 
and recycles hazardous waste streams and has effective and 
prompt clean-up and remediation measures to ensure seamless 
operations. The Company has a structured process to manage 
decommissioned facilities to reduce regulatory and litigation risks 
and associated costs.
Waste Management and Circular Economy N
  The Company’s operations across business segments 
impact Goal 3, underlined in the UN SDGs, which aims to ensure 
healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all.
UN SDG: 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including 
financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare 
services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable 
essential medicines and vaccines for all.
UN SDG: 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths 
and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil 
pollution and contamination.
  Workers involved in various manufacturing activities could 
face significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working 
environments and the hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition 
to acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop 
chronic health conditions. Therefore, worker health and safety 
performance can have an impact on Reliance’s operations and 
profitability. RIL recognises the importance of healthy and safe 
working conditions as a human right, implementing a globally 
benchmarked HSE framework across all sites, services, and offices
Health, Safety and Employee Wellbeing H
  Reliance has robust talent management systems to identify 
high-potential employees and provide opportunities for career 
growth and development. This helps to retain top talent, create 
a culture of continuous learning, and build a more skilled and 
knowledgeable workforce that can drive business performance 
and innovation. Effective talent management plays a crucial role 
in improving both employee experience and client satisfaction, 
which ultimately leads to higher business performance and 
Return on Investment for Reliance.
  Reliance offers peer-benchmarked monetary and non-
monetary benefits to enhance employee engagement and 
improve retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve 
employee engagement and work-life balance can positively 
influence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.
Talent Management H
  Maintaining cordial labour relations is crucial for Reliance 
to ensure the wellbeing and productivity of its workforce. A 
healthy labour relationship means that both the management 
and the employees are led by a common purpose, which 
results in improved job satisfaction, employee retention, and 
organisational performance.
  The Company’s significance to the economy as a major 
employer means that it is also often at the centre of public 
discussions around labour practices. Therefore, poor performance 
in labour relations can have serious reputational implications for 
the Company.
Customers regularly interact directly with employees in the 
Retail business. Reliance can face a decrease in market share and 
revenues from negative customer sentiments generated due to 
public disagreements between the Company and its workers.
Labour Management H
  Vulnerable sections of the population, with limited 
capacity to defend their rights and interests, may need added 
effort and support to ensure their human rights are protected. 
The Company’s governance structures and actions can account 
for the same.
  Reliance faces additional community-related risks when 
operating in sensitive areas to protect human rights and areas 
with vulnerable communities such as indigenous peoples. If 
Reliance is perceived to be violating human rights or failing to 
account for indigenous peoples’ rights, the operations of the 
Company may be affected due to protests, riots, or suspension 
of permits.

negative sentiments amongst stakeholders, including customers 
and impact business. The Company has a structured approach 
to enhancing supplier performance, deepening sustainability 
practices, and a well-defined Code of Conduct that mandates 
respect for human rights across the value chain.
Sustainable Supply Chain Management S
  Data privacy is a global concern that has increased 
significantly in the past few years. Access to private data and lack 
of digital privacy threatens the security and safety of millions of 
people worldwide. Reliance’s digital business is susceptible to 
data breaches, and the Company has implemented cutting-edge 
security measures and complies with all applicable regulations to 
protect its customers’ privacy.
  Data breaches can result in the leakage of confidential 
company information. Reliance’s extensive digital presence 
and large market share makes it a common target for such 
breaches. The Company has implemented several initiatives to 
make its technology framework secure and resilient and protect 
confidential assets and information.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity I
  Reliance has a well-established Code of Conduct that 
is applicable to its employees and the value chain, supported 
by strong governance structures and business practices to 
prevent corruption and wilful or unintentional participation in 
illegal or unethical payments or gifts to government officials or 
private persons.
  Managing business ethics and maintaining appropriate 
levels of transparency in payments to governments or individuals 
are significant issues for Reliance. Strong relations are critical to 
ensure the Company’s ability to conduct business. Inappropriate 
action or violation of business ethics could lead to significant 
one-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs. Reliance 
ensures compliance with all regulations and has a well-established 
Code of Conduct that mandates ethical business behaviour 
at all times. These measures offer adequate risk mitigation 
opportunities and prevent adverse outcomes.

Reliance Retail –  
Zero Waste Stores
Reliance Retail has 
implemented an initiative to 
establish zero-waste stores 
as part of its commitment to 
environmental sustainability. 
This initiative involves the 
collection of waste from 
various retail stores, which is 
then transported to processing 
centres. At the processing 
centres, the waste is sorted into 
different categories, including 
plastic, glass, e-waste, metal, 
organic, and mixed waste.
The organic waste is 
composted, while the dry 
waste is further segregated 
into various groups. The plastic 
waste is chopped and sent for 
the manufacturing of plastic 
products. The used papers 
are processed for making 
paper products, and the 
metal is sent for melting and 
reuse. The e-waste is sent for 
further processing.
Reliance Retail has taken significant 
steps towards reducing waste 
and promoting sustainability. The 
Company initiated a programme to 
collect plastic bags and Tetra Packs 
for recycling into useful products. 
In 2022, Reliance Retail collected 
1.57 million cartons weighing 
11,797 Kgs and utilised them to 
manufacture 100 desks, which 
were subsequently donated to four 
schools. In 2023, Reliance Retail 
collected a million cartons weighing 
8,047 Kgs and utilised them to 
manufacture 10 garden benches 
and 100 desks which were donated 
to underprivileged schools.30 Tetra 
Pack collection bins were also 
donated as part of this programme.
In addition to this, as part of the 
green initiative, Reliance Retail 
conducted ten staff training 
programmes, eight webinars, and 
fifteen eco workshops. The unit also 
performed an audit and branding of 
54 stores and donated over 100,000 
smart small eco-friendly products.
Reliance Retail has successfully 
reduced plastic usage by 
introducing biodegradable and 
virgin paper bags. Currently, 
recycled paper bags are being used 
in grocery stores across 12 states 
and biodegradable bags in 15 states. 
To further reduce waste, open 
delivery options have been rolled 
out in certain cities without bags. In 
Mumbai, Milk Basket and JioMart 
have successfully stopped the use 
of polybags for almost 70% of their 
orders. Reliance Retail has also 
started collecting plastic bags and 
tetra packs returned by customers 
to bring to life the Company’s 
commitment to make the ‘best out 
of waste’.

up to 15,000 single-use plastic 
bottles and 1500+ litres of water. 
Green power was utilised at the Jio 
World Convention Centre (JWCC), 
Mumbai saving carbon emissions 
of 400 tonnes. Show invites 
were collected to minimise paper 
waste, and 67 kgs of show invites 
were recycled into books/diaries 
for underprivileged kids. Waste 
management on-site was optimised 
by setting up an on-site composting 
setup at JWCC. A live recycling 
centre was set up to recycle 
single-use plastic into fashion and 
lifestyle accessories as giveaways 
for those who brought plastic to 
the centre, which offset up to 3 
tonnes of carbon emissions. An 
online carbon footprint calculator 
was introduced for guests to 
estimate their emissions to reach 
the venue and encouraged them 
to plant trees to offset the same. 
Production guidelines were shared 
with all stakeholders to encourage 
the use of sustainable materials. 
JWCC provided an apt platform

Reliance is transforming its 
operational approach and 
designing sustainability 
roadmaps to reach its 
goal of becoming Net 
Carbon Zero by 2035. The 
Company recognises the 
urgent need to address 
the global challenges of 
climate change and is 
taking decisive action to 
decarbonise its operations 
and transition from fossil 
fuels to cleaner, greener 
forms of energy. To 
achieve this goal, Reliance 
has made significant 
investments and is 
actively seeking strategic 
partnerships to help drive 
the transition to clean 
energy not only in India 
but also globally. This 
forward-thinking approach 
by Reliance is a critical 
step in addressing climate 
change and demonstrates 
the Company’s 
commitment to building a 
sustainable future for all 
stakeholders.
Reliance sources significant volumes 
of water to run smooth operations. 
The Company has a comprehensive 
approach to reducing freshwater 
withdrawal and consumption in line 
with its sustainability commitments. 
It focuses on maximising recyclability 
and minimising external discharge 
by deploying advanced technology 
solutions and stringent governance 
measures, including monitoring usage, 
reviewing performance and complying 
with applicable regulations.
Reliance is also prioritising maximising 
wastewater recyclability and treated 
water reuse by increasing rainwater 
harvesting, improving water efficiency 
in manufacturing, and using treated 
wastewater for domestic purposes.
Reliance has made substantial 
investments in automation to enhance 
operational efficiency and productivity, 
leading to a decrease in overall 
water consumption. The Company* 
withdrew a total of 224.9 million 
kilolitres of water during the year, 
of which 36.7 million kilolitres was 
discharged and 104.8 million kilolitres 
recycled. In addition, the Exploration 
and Production vertical has reported 
4.8 million kilolitres of produced water.

The one common, unifying 
thread that runs through 
everything at Reliance is the 
spirit of CARE and EMPATHY 
for its employees, customers, 
communities and all other 
stakeholders. The Company’s 
rise to become one of the world’s 
largest and most respected 
organisations is a result of the 
talent and determination of its 
employees. Today, Reliance

of leaders who are driven and 
passionate about building 
a New India and a better

The Company believes that 
healthy interpersonal relations

that the Company can continue 
to create sustainable value for

Management Approach 
Reliance is one of India’s most 
preferred and largest private sector 
employers, known for its strong and 
equitable human capital strategy. 
Reliance is committed to creating 
a supportive and inclusive work 
environment where employees 
feel valued, safe, connected, and 
treated with respect and empathy. 
During the year, people manager 
trainings were conducted regularly 
to better understand and develop 
skillsets for building psychologically 
safe environments and proactively 
addressing mental well-being issues. 
R-Manager, a learning programme, 
has been launched to equip first-time 
managers with essential people 
management skills. Additionally, 
various leadership development 
programmes like CAP, FLYER, 
and STEP UP help to nurture and 
empower young leaders, guide 
them on internalising the Founder’s 
Mindset, and build Leadership 
Capital in the organisation.
Reliance believes diversity gives 
an organisation a competitive 
edge, encourages innovation and 
vibrancy of thought and action. 
A diverse workplace strengthens 
understanding of and responsiveness 
to the ever-changing needs of a 
varied customer base. The Company 
has implemented several initiatives 
to attract and develop a diverse and 
inclusive workforce, with a focus on 
women, to continue its successful 
evolution as an organisation. From 
launching a women’s engagement 
platform, HerCircle (launched in 2021), 
to offering mentorship, leadership 
development programmes and 
flexible work arrangements, Reliance 
is committed to creating successful, 
sustainable and impactful careers 
for women. 
The Company has implemented a 
comprehensive approach to human 
capital management to address 
the key issues identified as part of 
a detailed materiality assessment 
conducted in the previous reporting 
year covering health, safety, and 
employee wellbeing; diversity, 
inclusion; talent management; labour 
management; human rights; business 
ethics, integrity, transparency; and 
grievance redressal mechanisms. 
The HRNR Board committee provides 
oversight and governance to monitor 
the performance of the people 
function. Additionally, multiple internal 
review meetings at the business 
segment level occur periodically to 
review the key HR issues, metrics 
and compliances.

  Health, Safety and 
Employee Well-being 
Reliance prioritises protecting, 
promoting, and enhancing employee 
wellbeing. The statement "Safety of 
persons overrides all production 
targets" emphasises the importance 
the Company places on the safety and 
wellbeing of its human capital. Reliance 
has a goal of zero incidents and believes 
all injuries, occupational illnesses, and 
safety and environmental incidents 
are preventable. 
Reliance recognises healthy and safe 
working conditions as a human right 
and adheres to all local and national 
health and safety regulations. The 
Company has implemented a globally 
benchmarked Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) framework across all 
sites, services, and offices.
The Company’s HSE policy complies 
with statutory requirements and covers 
all its employees and contractors. The 
policy terms are implemented through 
a systematic Operating Management 
System (OMS) that promotes 
execution excellence and compliance 
to manage Health, Safety, Security 
and Environment (HSSE) risks in daily 
operations. Implementing a standardised 
risk management process through the 
OMS has improved risk awareness and 
understanding among asset-facing 
personnel, who can now manage 
operational risks in real-time. Reliance 
continually reviews and updates the 
organisation’s HSE practices to deepen 
the safety culture.
The Change Agents for Safety, 
Health and Workplace Environment 
(CASHE) is an internationally 
recognised programme by Reliance 
to prioritise workplace safety and 
health. This innovative program has 
a proactive and preventive approach 
that fosters teamwork by the Medical, 
Safety, Environment and Technical 
departments and has established 
a landmark in occupational health. 
CASHE has created a hazard-free 
environment and a positive change in 
the work attitude of employees and 
contract workers from the grassroots 
to the highest level. 
Task-Based Health Risk Assessment 
(TBHRA), a part of CASHE, 
introduces employees to the concept 
of comprehensive health risks and 
their relevance in the workplace. 
The TBHRA has been endorsed by 
the employees as fundamental to a 
safe workplace.
In FY 2022-23, the Company invested 
`987 crores in HSE initiatives. 
The company has implemented 
a comprehensive procedure to 
extract valuable insights from 
each incident, thereby facilitating 
organisational learning through 
thorough investigations and proactive 
measures. These processes have been 
digitalised, leveraging an integrated 
incident management application 
that enables efficient reporting, 
investigation, action tracking, and 
knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, 
the incorporation of controls within 
these processes ensures effective 
management and mitigation 
of incidents.
A Safety & Operational Risk function 
at the corporate level brings specialised 
knowledge and provides independent 
assurance. This function aligns OMS 
requirements with global and national 
standards such as OSHA, ACGIH, API, 
PESO, PNGRB, OISD and NFPA. The 
Company has adopted a three lines of 
defense approach to gain an impartial

perspective on OMS implementation for

The OMS principles are integrated within 
the operational framework, ensuring 
the safe, compliant and dependable 
functioning of the business. The system 
is continually enhanced to draw on 
learnings from incidents to improve 
operational efficiency, safety and 
reliability further.
The Company conducts regular 
training sessions for employees and 
workers to improve their awareness and 
understanding of workplace hazards 
and risks. The Company maintains 
open communication channels with its 
employees and workers to understand 
their concerns and feedback related to 
HSE and address them promptly. 
Reliance collaborates with other industry 
players to further the mission of health 
and safety for all and sponsored the 
"6th Global Summit on Process Safety" 
organised by the Centre for Chemical 
Process Safety. 
The Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHS) Management system at Reliance 
encompasses the Hazard Identification 
and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process, 
workers' training and incident 
identification frameworks. Highly 
competent HSE and Process Safety 
teams within the operating units are 
responsible for the governance of OHS.
Reliance ensures regular HSE 
communication and awareness 
to enhance workplace safety 
culture. Through regular message 
broadcasting, the Company keeps 
employees informed about safety 
policies, procedures, and best 
practices, empowering them to take 
ownership of safety. 
Through consistent engagement 
with the asset-facing personnel, 
the Company has demonstrated 
unwavering commitment to 
maintaining a secure work 
environment. During the year 
there was no fatality in the 
manufacturing operations.
The Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) for O2C and E&P (excluding 
Malaysia) is 0.14 per million man-hours. 
In Malaysia, the LTIFR was 2.01 per 
million man-hours. The LTIFR for Retail 
is 0.05 per million man-hours, and 
the LTIFR for Jio is 0.20 per million 
man-hours.
Road Safety Awareness Drive
A 'Road Safety Month' featuring 
awareness events and training 
programmes for employees on 
safe practices and behaviours was 
organised by Reliance.

Talent Sustainability and 
Building Future Readiness
• Annual talent review and 
succession planning: Reliance 
has robust succession planning 
mechanisms to identify high-potential 
talent and prepare them for critical 
leadership positions. The identified 
talent receives structured Individual 
Development Plans with personalised 
development support in line with 
the same. This involves methods like 
coaching, job shadowing and working 
on stretch assignments, along with 
traditional educational support.
• The Company focuses on upskilling 
employees in emerging technologies 
and new age skills on a regular basis. 
Awareness is built at a mass level on 
areas such as Artificial Intelligence 
& Machine Learning, Virtual, 
augmented and mixed reality and 
Internet of Things. Deep skilling of 
specific target groups, including our 
high potential talent, is aligned to 
technology implementation plans in 
the respective domains.
Nurturing a Coaching Culture
The Company actively encourages 
mentoring and coaching as a 
professional development and growth 
pathway. At Reliance Retail, coaching is 
structured in three stages: performance 
coaching, transition coaching and 
succession coaching. The unit focuses 
on identifying senior leaders and 
building their capacity to coach. 
Reliance Retail’s vision is to develop 
and certify 1000 coaches within 
the organisation. These coaches 
will then train through a dedicated 
Coaching-on-Demand platform, 
wherein any employee within the 
organisation can choose and avail 
of the coaching support. Executive 
coaching engagement is also provided 
to senior leaders to manage their 
transitions, enhance their performance

leadership positions.

PeopleFirst revolutionises the way 
diverse internal and external talent 
experiences Reliance, drives swifter 
adoption of ‘future of work practices’, 
and helps build an organisation 
that continues to thrive in a rapidly 
changing business environment.
Source-Train-Hire
Reliance Retail aims to expand its business in Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities but ready source of a trained workforce is a challenge. To 
address this issue, Reliance Retail launched the Source-Train-Hire model, which involves sourcing and training economically 
and socially disadvantaged candidates before hiring them as full-time employees. However, the pandemic disrupted 
physical classroom training, and the Company had to switch to virtual training. Reliance Retail curated new content and 
created an appropriate ecosystem for distance learning. The model has been successful, with over 14,548 candidates 
trained and 13,290 candidates placed in FY 2022-23, with coverage across 30 states and 900+ cities. 61% of the candidates 
were from rural areas, and 24% were women.

Human Capital
Reliance judges its leaders by their expertise 
to plan, execute, review and improve. Indeed, 
New India needs leaders whose capability 
must always exceed the complexity of the 
problem they are expected to solve.
Shri Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries
The tenets of Institutional Leadership 
Capacity Building
At the 45th Reliance AGM held on August 29, 2022, the 
Chairman, outlined the Company’s ten tenets for building 
leadership capital through nurturing the Founder Mindset 
at Reliance – now and in the future.
Among the ten capitals outlined, the following eight are designed to strengthen the Company’s Human Capital.
People 
Capital
Reliance has an ongoing focus on human capital development by investing in and nurturing the skills, 
knowledge, and abilities of the workforce. Mentoring is facilitated for employees to gain valuable insights 
into the Company culture and best practices, enhance productivity and grow professionally. 
Capability 
Capital
Promoting Capability Capital entails investing in and nurturing the skills, knowledge, and abilities of 
employees to expand their capabilities and improve their performance. Reliance ensures this through 
career acceleration programmes designed to help employees advance their careers through training and 
development opportunities, mentoring, and coaching.
Talent review and succession planning helps identify employees most likely to be successful in leadership 
roles and other key positions. 
Achievement 
Capital
To build a positive culture of recognition and motivation within the Company, Reliance rewards and 
honours achievers who exceed expectations. This reward might be in the form of financial incentives, 
promotions, plaques or public recognition. 
Relationship 
Capital
To strengthen relationship capital within the organisation, Reliance fosters a positive and inclusive 
organisational culture through regular team-building activities, open and transparent communication, 
and opportunities for employees to connect outside of work. Regular meetings, clear and concise 
communication channels, and opportunities for employees to work together on projects and initiatives to 
promote effective communication and collaboration. 
Trust Capital Trust is a critical component of functioning at Reliance since it allows people to work together effectively, 
make decisions quickly and confidently, and build long-term relationships. At Reliance, leaders and 
managers are encouraged to promote transparency and build regular communication with employees at all 
levels to create and maintain a sense of trust. 
Cooperation 
Capital
Reliance believes that cooperation is essential to achieving goals and objectives, as it allows people 
to work together effectively and maximise their collective expertise and resources. The Company has 
included cooperation as an integral part of its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and promotes cross-
functional collaboration. 
Reliance has created channels for open and regular communication and feedback to help employees work 
together effectively and solve problems quickly and efficiently. 
Empathy 
Capital
Reliance believes compassionate capitalism needs compassionate leaders. Empathy capital at Reliance 
is symbolic of the organisation’s compassionate leadership. Empathy is important for Reliance because it 
allows people at the Company to connect with one another on a deeper level, understand and respect one 
another’s perspectives and experiences, and work together more effectively. 
Reliance also highlights empathy capital by encouraging employees to give back to the community and be 
socially responsible.
Integrity 
Capital
Reliance upholds the highest standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. Ethics is one of the five 
enablers of the Company’s strategy and, is a source of our competitive strength. Reliance is committed 
to establishing a culture of integrity, transparency, openness and compliance – as evident in our Values, 
Behaviours, and Code of Conduct. 
Reliance considers itself an integral part of the business ecosystem and takes it upon itself to extend 
all support to our business partners to also work towards ethical conduct of business. Towards this, an 
e-learning module – "Satarkata" – has been rolled out, and access is provided to identified business 
associates. This will help vendors better understand Reliance’s Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) 
and create the right levels of awareness about the Company’s expectations of ethical conduct from 
business partners.
  Labour Management 
and Human Rights
Reliance follows the principles of 
the United Nations Global Compact 
on human rights, labour practices, 
environmental protection, and 
anti-corruption. The Company’s 
operations adhere to local and 
national regulations and also ensure 
adherence to the Code of Conduct. 
Collective bargaining agreements cover 
the majority of permanent workers 
across all manufacturing facilities. No 
instances of child labour, forced labour, 
involuntary labour, sexual harassment, 
or discriminatory employment were 
reported during the reporting period. 
Men and women in the same roles 
receive equal pay at the entry-level 
in Reliance.
  Business Ethics, 
Integrity and 
Transparency
Reliance’s Code of Conduct defines 
the behaviour expected from all the 
employees and stakeholders and 
lays down the policies and systems 
for effective implementation. These 
guidance documents enable employees 
to operate with ethics, integrity and 
transparency at all times. The HR 
Leadership periodically evaluates 
the people policies to keep them 
relevant to changing regulatory and 
market requirements. 
An Ethics and Compliance Task Force 
(ECTF) is in place to oversee and 
monitor the implementation of ethical 
business practices within Reliance. All 
complaints related to ethics, non-
compliance and violations of the 
Company’s Code of Conduct received 
by ECTF are reviewed and reported to 
the Audit Committee every quarter. 
Reliance has proactively taken measures 
to combat bribery and corruption. The 
Company has established a robust 
Anti-Bribery Management System 
(ABMS) as an additional pillar to support 
existing governance mechanisms. 
ABMS is a systematic framework of 
policy and processes set up by Reliance 
to help prevent, detect and respond to 
bribery risks. 
The Company has mandatory e-learning 
courses to help employees understand 
the norms required to work in a safe, 
compliant and ethical manner through 
the ABMS system. The learning 
module sensitises employees about 
the concept of bribery, how it happens, 
and its various types, causes, and 
effects. The module helps recognise 
red flags indicating bribery, advises 
about overcoming bribery, and explains 
the link between ABMS and Reliance’s 
Code of Conduct. The module also 
emphasises the importance of ABMS 
violation reporting. It highlights 
Reliance’s expectations from employees 
and business associates in the context 
of its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
(ABAC) policy.
To benchmark itself against the best 
in class, Reliance has adopted the ISO 
37001:2016 standards for its ABMS.
  Grievance Redressal 
Mechanisms
Employees and other stakeholders are 
required to report actual or suspected 
violations of applicable laws and 
regulations and the Code of Conduct. 
Reliance has established a robust 
mechanism through a Vigil Mechanism 
and Whistle-blower Policy for reporting 
and handling of such violations, termed 
as ‘Reportable Matters’. Under this 
policy, the employees are encouraged 
to report any such violations without 
fear of retaliation. For easy access, the 
Vigil Mechanism and Whistle-blower 
Policy is hosted on the website of the 
Company. The whistle-blower can 
make a protected disclosure either to 
the Ethics and Compliance Task Force 
or directly to the Audit Committee via 
e-mail, telephone or letter without fear 
of any reprisal.
WAY FORWARD
Reliance is leading the 
movement to build the next 
generation of leaders who 
will significantly contribute 
to the advancement of 
India and the world. 
The Company aspires to 
advance its internal talent 
management system to 
accelerate the development 
of employees while ensuring 
their overall emotional and 
physical wellbeing. Reliance 
will embed the principles 
of diversity and inclusion 
deeper into its core strategic 
intent and across its 
operations and value chain. 
Implementing globally 
benchmarked Health, 
Safety and Environment 
practices will continue to 
be a critical focus for the 
Company.
The Company has outlined 
ten tenets to develop 
institutional leadership 
capacity and intends to 
relentlessly nurture human 
capital by significantly 
focusing on identified 
parameters. The Company 
places the greatest value on 
the power of human thought 
and compassion and will 
strive to maintain this 
culture to deliver sustainable 
and consistent value to its 
stakeholders and others.
Manufactured  
Capital
Reliance is driven by its 
mission to create a greener 
future for India and the 
world through the responsible 
production of sustainable 
products that create holistic 
value for its stakeholders. The 
Company makes strategic 
investments in deploying 
advanced technologies and 
environmentally conscious 
manufacturing processes that 
optimise the efficiency of its 
existing and new operations.

leadership, backed by robust 
Research and Development

Reliance Retail
The retail business has grown 
exponentially since its inception in 
2006 to become the largest retailer 
in India in 2014 and is now counted 
among the top global retailers in 
the world. 
Reliance Retail continues to innovate 
and adapt to the changing retail 
landscape. The Company’s strategy 
of expanding its physical stores, 
merchant partners and digital 
commerce platforms, offers increased 
accessibility and convenience to 
its customers. In FY 2022-23, the 
Company opened over 3,300 stores 
all over India, bringing the total store 
count to 18,040. Reliance Retail has 
also increased its warehousing and 
fulfilment space by more than 50%.

New Commerce initiatives by growing 
its merchant base to over 3 million 
partners. The Company aims to 
expand its presence to cover the 
country, serving over 7,500 towns and 
3 lakh villages. 
Reliance Retail operates multiple 
digital commerce platforms which 
continue to show steady growth year 
after year. During the year, JioMart 
partnered with Whatsapp to launch a 
native app which customers can use 
to shop through JioMart’s catalogue. 
This democratises online shopping 
opportunities for a large number 
of shoppers who do not currently 
shop on JioMart. Moreover, with the 
acquisition of Netmeds, a pan-India 
digital pharmacy, the Retail business 
has gained a strong foothold in the 
online pharmaceutical segment 
further broadening its customer base.

business has an expansive physical 
reach. It also operates AJIO, an 
integrated online platform that

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
Climate Change
Reliance is committed to contributing towards a greener planet and 
is taking proactive actions to address issues related to climate change 
leveraging its intellectual capital. 
Towards Single-use 
Plastic Free Operations
The Company recognises the 
detrimental impact of plastic on 
the environment. The Company 
is undertaking steps to reduce, 
recycle and reuse plastics going 
beyond compliance with the 
ever-evolving environmental 
regulations. Reliance aims to 
reduce and eventually avoid 
the use of single-use plastics in 
its operations and ecosystem. 
The Company is exploring the 
use of alternative materials and 
developing pathways to produce 
biodegradable and compostable 
plastics as a substitute for 
single-use plastics. 
Biodegradable 
Polybutylene Adipate 
Terephthalate (PBAT)
Reliance is developing 
biodegradable PBAT processes 
and products for the retail and 
agriculture sectors. The Company 
has successfully run a commercial 
scale pilot of biodegradable net 
bags at the Reliance Retail outlets 
in Ahmedabad and Bangalore. 
The customers have shared 
positive feedback on the product 
performance and ease of use.
Co-Gasification of 
Biomass
Reliance is working to introduce 
biomass in the existing gasifier 
unit as one of the pathways 
to generate green hydrogen, 
green methanol, green diesel, 
Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) 
to achieve its Net Carbon Zero 
target by 2035. 
CO2 to Syngas
The Company has developed a 
highly active catalyst and a process 
for reverse water gas shift reaction 
(rWGS) to convert CO2 to Syngas 
as a potential route to make 
green methanol. 
Needle Coke and  
Synthetic Graphite 
Manufacturing
Reliance has developed a 
technology for needle coke 
production utilising existing assets 
and feed from the refinery. Once 
implemented, this will enable the 
Company to produce high-quality 
Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) anode 
raw material sustainably. It will 
also reduce Reliance refineries’ 
carbon footprint by switching from 
fuel-grade coke to needle coke and 
synthetic graphite. 
Biomass-Derived Anode 
Material for Sodium-Ion 
Batteries
The Company has developed a 
technology to produce high-quality 
anode material from biomass 
for sodium-ion batteries that will 
reduce production costs without 
compromising energy density 
and cyclability.
Hard Carbon Development 
for Battery Applications
The Reliance R&D team has 
developed a novel process for 
producing hard carbon using 
polymer precursor. The developed 
hard carbon will be used as anode 
material in sodium-ion battery 
applications enhancing the 
circularity of operations.
Intellectual Capital
Cyber Security Awareness
Technology has become the 
lifeline of businesses globally 
and indispensable for running 
day to day operations. Along 
with the pervasive spread of 
technology use, cyber-attacks are 
also becoming more frequent, 
and individuals are being 
increasingly targeted. Not only 
are people susceptible to various 
forms of online fraud, but they 
can also unknowingly become 
accomplices in attacks against 
their own organisations. Therefore, 
raising awareness about cyber 
security is crucial, and it should 
extend beyond the workplace to 
encompass appropriate online 
behavior in all aspects of life. In 
October 2022, a Cyber Suraksha 
Handbook was released across 
Reliance as part of a month-long 
cyber security awareness 
campaign. This handbook provides 
guidance on maintaining online 
safety at work and in personal life 
for children and teenagers and for 
safeguarding personal information. 
Employees were encouraged 
to share the booklet with their 
families, friends, and communities 
to promote broader awareness and 
contribute to making the cyber 
world a safer place.
  Data Privacy and 
Cybersecurity
Reliance is well aware of the risks 
associated with handling personal 
data and takes significant measures 
to ensure its security. The Company 
has a ‘Data Privacy Policy’ in place 
to protect information consisting of 
Personal information and 'Sensitive 
Personal Data or Information’ (SPDI) 
of visitors of the Reliance website and 
comply with all legal, regulatory and/
or contractual obligations related to 
privacy. At Reliance the privacy of 
individuals/visitors is highly regarded. 
The Company is dedicated to taking 
appropriate measures to safeguard 
Personal Information. Reliance has 
embraced the "Privacy by Default" 
principles, where the privacy of data 
and information is automatically 
prioritised. This policy encompasses 
the processing, storage, and access 
to Information required under lawful 
and/or contractual activities with 
Reliance or as otherwise required in 
the regular course of business.
Reliance places great importance 
on adhering to the privacy-by-
design principle and ensuring 
that all business processes handle 
information in a secure and 
responsible manner. Regular privacy 
impact analyses are conducted across 
all businesses to identify any gaps 
and address them efficiently.
Jio recognises the importance of 
providing a secure experience for its 
users and protecting their personal 
information. Therefore, it integrates 
data privacy and protection and 
information security into the design 
of its digital services, underlined with 
an effective governance structure and 
inculcating an institutional culture 
of security through awareness-
building programmes. 
The proactive assessment of security 
risks is undertaken through stringent 
processes, including: 
• Evaluation and identification of any 
security-related flaws in its services, 
products, and technology
• Implementing advanced security 
monitoring infrastructure and 
effective incident detection and 
management processes
• In the event of a suspected security 
incident, Jio analyses and verifies 
the impact on its assets and 
the organisation
WAY FORWARD
Reliance’s rise to become 
one of the world’s leading 
conglomerates is powered by 
its robust intellectual capital 
that empowers the Company 
to break new ground and 
expand its business footprint 
and offerings portfolio to 
meet the emerging needs of 
customers and society. The 
Company recognises the 
importance of investing in 
cutting-edge technologies, 
products, and services to 
create value for its customers 
and other stakeholders. 
With this in mind, Reliance is 
making significant capital and 
resource investments to deepen 
skills, expand R&D capabilities 
and broaden the focus areas 
for research and innovation 
to tap into new market 
opportunities and contribute 
to building a sustainable and 
inclusive society.
One of the most notable 
examples of Reliance’s 
commitment to innovation 
is Jio’s True 5G network, 
which has already reached 
2,300+ Indian cities/towns 
and transformed the lives 
of millions of Indians. The 
Company intends to continue 
to grow Jio’s services to realise 
India’s digital aspirations.
The Company’s R&D pursuits 
are designed to play a 
critical role in charting the 
desired pathways to a Net 
Carbon Zero future. With this 
goal, The Company fosters 
innovation and research to 
promote a circular economy, 
enhance resource efficiency, 
and broaden access to 
affordable and clean energy 
through sustainable products 
and solutions.
• The incident management 
processes determine the criticality 
level of each incident, and 
they are managed in line with 
documented procedures
An effective governance structure 
is in place to minimise security 
incidents and protect personal 
information. The Company 
implements a comprehensive 
information security management 
programme, with policies and 
processes to protect its business, 
customers, infrastructure, 
services, and internal users from 
security threats.

in international sporting events, 
including the Olympics. The 
Foundation has partnered with 
various organisations, including 
the Odisha Government and the

mission. The partnership with the 
Odisha government has created a 
state-of-the-art High-Performance

also serves as a national centre 
for the training and development

Olympic Movement
Led by its Chairperson 
Smt. Nita Ambani, Reliance 
Foundation is leading the 
charge to spread the Olympic 
Movement across India. The 
success of the Foundation’s 
endeavours is best reflected in 
the success of the delegation led 
by Smt. Ambani winning the bid 
to host the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) Session in 
Mumbai in 2023. This is a major 
milestone for India and its people 
as it will bring back the Olympic 
movement to the nation after 
four decades. 
Reliance and the Indian Olympic 
Association (IOA) announced a 
long-term partnership to elevate 
the performances of Indian 
athletes, support the national 
sports federation, and build 
the credentials of India as a 
global sporting nation, with an 
aspiration to host the Olympic 
Games in the future. Under this 
partnership, Reliance and IOA will 
also establish the first-ever India 
House at Paris Olympics 2024. 
These initiatives go a long way 
to demonstrate India’s readiness 
to become a significant sporting 
nation globally.

Women who led India through 
the 'pandemic', a book by Reliance 
Foundation and Observer Research 
Foundation that celebrates the women 
who supported their communities during 
the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Another 
publication ‘Access, Aspirations and 
Agency’ focuses on women from the 
grassroots who have helped bridge the 
Gender Digital Divide. 
These knowledge sharing initiatives 
built visibility for women’s voices among 
key stakeholders.

India’s first-of-its-kind, multi-
disciplinary cultural space, the 
Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre 
was inaugurated in March 2023, with 
an exquisite showcase of the best of 
India across music, theatre, fine arts, 
and crafts to audiences from India and 
the world. The Centre marked another 
definitive step in strengthening India’s 
cultural infrastructure and bringing to 
fruition the best of India and the world 
in the sphere of arts.
In line with Reliance Foundation’s 
Founder & Chairperson Mrs. Nita M 
Ambani’s vision to promote art in 
India, the launch programme featured 
a specially curated art and craft 
exposition called ‘Swadesh’ along 
with three inspiring shows – a musical 
theatrical called ‘The Great Indian 
Musical: Civilization to Nation', a 
costume art exhibition called ‘India in 
Fashion’ and a visual art show called 
‘Sangam/Confluence’. Together, the 
programmes were an exploration 
into the diversity of India’s cultural 
traditions and their impact on the 
world, while also showcasing the 
versatility of the spaces at the Cultural 
Centre. Reliance has been undertaking 
various initiatives to take Indian art and 
culture to the global stage.
Reliance Foundation supported a 
unique event in July 2022 featuring 
Indian devotional music, Bolava Vitthal, 
in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Jaipur. The 
intent was to promote and preserve 
India’s rich traditional art and culture.
Reliance Jio has deployed towers 
in far-flung tribal villages across 
Arunachal Pradesh and Andhra 
Pradesh to reach connectivity and 
the benefits of the digital era to these 
unserved communities. Aimed at 
making the digital revolution inclusive 
and fostering equitable development 
across the country, Reliance 
envisions that mobile connectivity 
to marginalised people will improve 
accessibility to education, healthcare 
and finance.

Lifestyle business emphasises 
strong customer-centricity in all 
business decisions. The Company 
has launched several initiatives to 
improve the customer experience 
for delivery, returns, order tracking, 
and refunds. The Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) is continuously 
tracked and through various 
initiatives, efforts are put to 
improve the matrix. The Company 
has introduced customer feedback 
forms in 9 regional languages and 
reduced the average turnaround 
time for customer complaints 
by 2.2 days. Ajio has launched 
chatbot and self-care sections on 
its app to provide 24/7 customer

repaid at the customer’s doorstep. 
Additionally, Ajio has improved its 
supply chain speed by over one 
day through order delivery speed

Customer Satisfaction 
Initiatives 
The Company ensures that the 
customer is at the focal point of all 
decision-making processes related 
to delivering products, services, and 
experiences. In line with this belief, 
Reliance Digital introduced multilingual 
customer support at its Contact Centre. 
Representatives can now communicate 
with customers in 10 different regional 
languages, ensuring that language is not 
a barrier to excellent service. Reliance 
Digital implemented new features on 
its resQ app to improve its functionality 
and convenience for customers who 
can now purchase and renew the req 
Care Plan (RCP) directly from the resQ 
app, streamlining the process and 
saving time. The Company promotes 
the resQ app through its Interactive 
Voice Response (IVR) and calls with 
customers, allowing them to easily raise 
repair and service requests without 
contacting the Contact Center. The 
Company also upgraded its WhatsApp 
Chatbot, enabling customers to get 
answers to most of their queries.
To better track and monitor call volumes 
across all channels, Reliance Digital 
migrated to the advanced Genesys 
platform. This has allowed the Company 
to revamp its IVR and create multiple 
call queues to reduce customer wait 
times, resulting in consistently achieving 
a 99% call answered ratio. Reliance 
has also implemented logic for auto-
assignment of email tickets to resolver 
groups and of repeat emails leading 
to a 34% reduction in complaint ratios 
compared to the previous year, with 
98% of customer emails being actioned 
within the specified turn around time.
Reliance Digital is proud to announce 
that its Contact Centre successfully 
renewed its ISO Certification,

organisation and encourages store 
managers and department managers 
to avail opportunities for professional 
growth and development. The 
Company’s impressive Net Promoter 
Score (NPS) has been consistently 
improving month on month. 
To maintain this positive momentum 
and continue to sustain and grow 
the customer experience, Reliance 
Digital launched a campaign called 
"Technology Se Rishta Jodo." Through 
this campaign, Reliance not only 
addresses customer needs but also 
educates them about the latest 
technology, helping them feel more 
comfortable and confident in their 
purchase decisions. Customers of all 
ages have responded positively to this 
approach, appreciating not only the 
Company’s competitive pricing and 
wide range of products but also the 
knowledge and confidence they gain 
in making technology purchases.
Oil to Chemicals
Reliance integrates sustainability 
assessments into its supplier 
evaluation and on-boarding processes. 
A rigorous screening process is 
undertaken for all suppliers. All 
suppliers must explicitly accept the 
Company’s Supplier Code of Conduct 
and ensure compliance with labour 
and human rights, health and safety, 
environmental protection, ethical 
conduct, business integrity, and 
confidentiality laws and standards. 
Reliance has robust mechanisms 
to ensure regulatory adherence 
and prevent unlawful behaviour 
by suppliers, including through 
its Ethics Committee and other 
compliance functions.

Supplier Relationship 
Management
The Company has made sustained 
investments in mega projects and 
operations that have contributed 
to the development of India’s 
supplier base in the chemicals and 
engineering sectors. Reliance supports 
and encourages its suppliers to 
indigenise, expand their capabilities, 
and grow their economic returns. The 
Company has established long-term 
relationships with leading Indian 
engineering companies, raw material 
suppliers, and industrial goods 
manufacturers and procured 75% of 
goods and services (non-crude/non-
feedstock) from indigenous suppliers 
in FY 2022-23.
Reliance has launched the 
'Supplier Relation Management 
(SRM)' programme to engage in 
constructive dialogue with critical 
O&M (Operations and Maintenance) 
contractors who provide services 
across the manufacturing sites. 
The SRM programme aims to build 
mutually beneficial relationships 
with the Company’s strategic service 
providers to drive higher and more 
satisfying service levels and promote 
quality, productivity, innovation, 
and ethical value-based association. 
Thirty contractors have been selected 
to participate in the first phase of 
this programme.
Reliance delivers superior products 
and services to its customers by 
working with its contractors to ensure 
that their employees are competent 
and that work is carried out in a safe 
environment in compliance with 
statutory requirements. Some of the 
initiatives on this front include:
• Standardisation of PPEs for 
contract workmen
• Fair & transparent practices of 
statutory compliance
• Contractor performance 
evaluation, including safety and 
environment performance
Dahej and Vadodara, and have 
operationalised their skill centre in 
Jamnagar to cater to the Company’s 
skilled resource requirements. 
Mechanical maintenance contractors 
have arranged train-the-trainer 
sessions through OEMs. In addition, 
contractors are investing in 
research and development (R&D) 
to continuously develop new tools, 
clamp design, and standard operating 
procedures to increase productivity 
and reduce lead times.
Reliance is also building business 
continuity with its suppliers’ next-
generation leaders who are keen on 
digital initiatives and support the 
Company’s current roll-out plans. 
Long-term agreements have been 
established with packaging suppliers 
to reduce system costs, including joint 
programmes with vendors to develop 
new products that offer alternate 
grades, lower dosage, and better 
product quality. Reliance is capturing 
the risk of high spend critical O&M 
service providers across business 
continuity, compliance, and financial 
risk. These collaborative efforts aim 
to build trust and establish long-term 
partnerships with contractors and 
suppliers to achieve the Company’s 
business objectives.
Make in India and Development 
of India’s Engineering Talent: 
Reliance has taken several initiatives 
to promote local sourcing and 
indigenisation of its supply chain. 
These include the replacement of 
imported Spin Finish oil with in-house 
recipes and indigenous manufacture, 
and development of alternate lubricity 
additive from a local source for the 
refinery. Reliance has also onboarded 
local suppliers to de-risk single source 
overseas suppliers and developed 
local integrators to supply low spend 
spares/consumables currently supplied 
by multiple tail spend vendors.
Launch of Digital Platform 
Applications for Procurement and 
Contracts: Reliance has launched a 
digital Procurement and Contracts 
(P&C) platform that uses Industry 4.0

handling of hazardous chemicals 
by vendors
  Sustainable Supply 
Chain Management
Reliance has implemented several 
initiatives in its supply chain to 
promote sustainable sourcing, 
reduce its environmental impact, and 
promote supplier engagement. The 
Company’s sustainable sourcing ethos 
focuses on following eight parameters:
Green Packaging: Reliance focuses 
on using recycled plastic/PET flakes, 
returnable pallets/tubes management, 
optimisation of bag specifications, 
and palletisation to reduce material 
usage and ensure safe handling and 
faster turnaround.
Environment Protection: Reliance 
aims to reduce wood consumption 
by replacing pine-wood platters with 
plastic pallets, bring down paper 
consumption through the use of 5-ply 
recycle cartons, and prefer energy-
efficient products. The Company 
makes procurement decisions based 
on energy efficiency and procures 
energy-efficient LED/solar lights. 
Reliance also focuses on catalyst 
regeneration/rare metals reuse.
Supplier Collaboration: Reliance 
collaborates with its contractors and 
suppliers to build contractor capacity, 
invest in R&D, ensure business 
continuity through suppliers’ new 
generation leaders, and establish 
long-term agreements. Major O&M 
contractors have established new 
skill development centres for Hazira, 
technologies to streamline end-to-end 
procurement processes. The platform 
includes several applications such as 
SourcingFirst, SupplierFirst, WellSpent 
and BuyerFirst, which ensure 
compliance with the Company’s 
sourcing policy, provide real-time 
visibility of the sourcing cycle, and 
minimise risk.
The P&C platform has developed 
multiple digital tools that enhance 
efficiency and address digital 
challenges faced by both buyers 
and suppliers. One such tool is the 
Automated Measurement Sheet 
(Green Channel), which considerably 
reduces invoicing lead time. This 
enables suppliers/contractors 
to receive quicker payment and 
better payment visibility. It also 
helps Reliance and its suppliers/
contractors to reduce paper usage and 
manual labor.
Contract Worker Care: Reliance 
ensures 100% compliance with laws 
and regulations related to contract 
worker wages payment verification, 
contractor worker safety focus, 
and contract worker PPE norms by 
work type.
Community Support: Reliance 
encourages the use of "near plant" 
community in its contracts.
Regeneration and Safe Disposal: 
The Company promotes the 
recycling of scrap thermal insulation, 
rejuvenation of hydro treating catalysts 
for refinery, sale of e-waste, used oil, 
used batteries, used catalyst, and 
plastic waste to vendors authorised 
by SPCB/CPCB, and recovery and 
recycling of all recyclable waste.
Robust Supplier Evaluation 
Criteria
The company follows a rigorous 
screening process for supplier 
registration and assessment during 
pre- and post-award stages. The 
Supplier Code of Conduct, is the basis 
of the company’s relationship with 
its suppliers. Reliance strengthens 
its commitment to the Supplier 
Code of Conduct by seeking explicit 
acceptance from its suppliers. The 
company also facilitates measures to 
comply with Anti-Money Laundering, 
Anti-Bribery, and Prevention of 
Corruption Act and its own Supplier 
Code of Conduct. The Ethics 
Committee and compliance functions 
undertake regulatory compliance 
and counterparty checks, real-time 
screening, and investigations to curb 
unlawful behaviour by suppliers.
Reliance has also subscribed to 
EcoVadis Sustainable Procurement 
solution to assess value chain partners 
in the O2C business on 21 parameters

key stakeholders such as 
customers, communities, and 
supply chain partners.
Reliance has adopted a 
customer-centric approach 
to understand the needs and 
preferences of its customers 
and provide tailored 
experiences and services 
that best meet their evolving 
needs. Combined with a 
world-class, differentiated 
experience, Reliance will 
further enhance long-term 
shareholder value and 
expand outreach to an 
expanded customer base.
The Company will continue 
to prioritise the development 
of a robust and sustainable 
supply chain, working 
closely with suppliers 
to manage disruptions, 
improve efficiency, and 
drive innovation. Reliance is 
developing and strengthening 
its value chain relationships 
to better leverage the 
expertise and resources of 
its partners to accelerate 
growth and innovation. 
The Company also takes 
conscious measures to 
enhance the capabilities of 
its partners and suppliers to 
broaden growth opportunities 
for them. Reliance stays 
focused on encouraging its 
suppliers and partners to 
embrace sustainable sourcing 
practices to minimise the 
environmental impact of the 
Company’s operations and 
that of its value chain.
Reliance’s unstinting support 
for community developmental 
imperatives will aim to 
empower and enrich many 
more community members 
so they can become equal 
partners and contributors 
to the nation’s success and 
secure a sustainable future 
for themselves and India.
Strengthening its social and 
relationship capital through 
trust-led and transparent 
stakeholder engagement will 
continue to be critical to help 
Reliance achieve long-term 
sustainable success.

Independent Assurance Statement to Reliance Industries Limited on select 
Non-financial Sustainability Disclosures in the Integrated Annual Report for 
FY 2022-23
Introduction
We, (‘KPMG Assurance and 
Consulting Services LLP’, or ‘KPMG’, 
or ‘the ‘Firm’) have been engaged 
by Reliance Industries Ltd (‘RIL ’ or 
‘the Company’) for the purpose 
of providing an independent 
assurance on the select non-
financial sustainability disclosures 
presented in the Integrated Annual 
Report 2022-23 (‘the Report’) of the 
Company for the period covering 1st 
April 2022 to 31st March 2023 (‘the 
Year’ or ‘the Reporting Period’) as 
described in the ‘scope, boundary, and 
limitations’ below.
Company’s Responsibilities
The management at the Company 
is responsible for preparing the 
Integrated Annual Report 2022-
23 that is free from any material 
misstatement in accordance with the 
reporting criteria stated in the Report 
(Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework 
and GRI Standards 2021) and for the 
information contained therein. The 
management at the Company is also 
responsible for preparing the designed 
Integrated Annual Report 2022-
23. The Company’s responsibilities 
include designing, implementing, and 
maintaining internal controls relevant 
to the preparation and presentation 
of the Report that is free from any 
material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. It also includes 
conducting the materiality assessment 
process to identify material topics 
relevant for the Company based 
on the responses of the internal 
and external stakeholders. The 
Company ensures that it complies 
with the reporting criteria and local 
regulations. It designs, implements, 
and effectively operates controls to 
achieve the stated control objectives; 
selects and applies policies; makes 
judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable in the circumstances; 
and maintains adequate records in 
relation to the Report. The Company 
is also responsible for preventing and 
detecting fraud and for identifying 
and ensuring compliance with laws 
and regulations applicable to its 
activities. The Company is responsible 
for ensuring that the Company’s staff 
involved with the preparation of the 
Report are properly trained, systems 
are properly updated and that any 
changes in reporting encompass all 
significant operational sites.
Our Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to examine the 
Report prepared by the Company 
and to report thereon on the select 
non-financial sustainability disclosures 
in the form of an independent 
assurance conclusion based on the 
evidence obtained. We conducted our 
engagement in accordance with the 
International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements Other 
Than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board. That standard 
requires that we plan and perform our 
procedures to obtain a meaningful 
level of assurance about whether 
the select non-financial sustainability 
disclosures in the Report comply 
with the reporting standards in all 
material respects, as the basis for our 
assurance conclusions.
The Firm applies International 
Standard on Quality Management 
1, which requires the Firm to design, 
implement and operate a system of 
quality management including policies 
or procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. We have 
complied with the independence 
and other ethical requirements of the 
International Ethics Standards Board 
for Accountants’ International Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence 
Standards) (IESBA Code), which 
is founded on the fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, 
professional competence and due 
care, confidentiality, and professional 
behaviour. The assurance procedures 
selected depend on our understanding 
of the Report of the Company and 
other engagement circumstances, and 
our consideration of the areas where 
material misstatements are likely 
to arise.
In obtaining an understanding of 
the Report and other engagement 
circumstances, we have considered 
the process used to prepare the 
Report in order to design assurance 
procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing a conclusion as 
to the effectiveness of the Company’s 
process or internal controls over 
the preparation and presentation of 
the Report.
Our engagement also included: 
assessing the appropriateness of the 
select non-financial sustainability 
disclosures and the suitability of 
the criteria used by the Company, 
evaluating the appropriateness of the 
methods, policies and procedures, and 
models used, and the reasonableness 
of estimates made by the Company 
in the context of the select non-
financial sustainability disclosures in 
the Report. The procedures performed 
in a limited assurance engagement 
vary in nature and timing from and 
are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Consequently, 
the level of assurance obtained in 
a limited assurance engagement is 
substantially lower than the assurance 
that would have been obtained had 
a reasonable assurance engagement 
been performed.
As part of this engagement, we have 
not performed any procedures by 
way of audit, review or verification of 
the financial disclosures nor of the 
underlying records or other sources 
from which the financial statements 
and information was extracted.
Assurance Procedures
Our assurance process involves 
performing procedures to obtain 
evidence about the reliability of the 
specified disclosures. The nature, 
timing and extent of procedures 
selected depend on our judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the select 
non-financial sustainability disclosures 
whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, we 
have considered internal controls 
relevant to the preparation of 
the Report to design assurance 
procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances.
These procedures included, 
interactions with relevant officials 
to understand their sustainability 
vision; interaction with the Company’s 
sustainability team to understand the 
translation of the Board of Directors’ 
vision into action; an assessment 
of the Company’s existing systems 
used for data collection and reporting 
relevant for fair presentation of the 
Company’s sustainability disclosures; 
review of the Company’s approach 
for stakeholder engagement and 
materiality assessment; testing, 
on a sample basis, of evidence 
supporting the data; evaluating the 
appropriateness of the quantification 
methods used to arrive at the non-
financial sustainability disclosures 
presented in the Report 2022-23; 
understanding the appropriateness 
of various assumptions, estimations 
and materiality thresholds used 
by the Company for data analysis; 
assessment of the consistency 
between the data for the selected 
sustainability performance indicators 
and the related written comments in 
the narrative of the Report 2022-23; 
interactions with staff responsible for 
data collection, collation and reporting; 
preparation of observation letter based 
on review and classification of findings 
for potential risk to sustainability 
framework; and discussion of the 
observations and findings with the 
sustainability team.

our customers have benefited from 
high quality products delivered at 
extremely competitive prices.
The essence of Corporate Governance 
lies in promoting and maintaining 
integrity, transparency and 
accountability in the management’s 
higher echelons. The demands 
of Corporate Governance require 
professionals to raise their 
competence and capability levels to 
meet the expectations in managing 
the enterprise and its resources 
effectively with the highest standards 
of ethics. It has thus become crucial 
to foster and sustain a culture that 
integrates all components of good 
governance by carefully balancing the 
inter relationship among the Board 
of Directors, Board Committees, 
Finance, Compliance & Assurance 
teams, Auditors and the Senior 
Management. Our employee 
satisfaction is reflected in the stability 
of senior management, ability to 
attract talent across various levels 
and substantially higher productivity. 
Above all, we feel honoured to be 
integral to India’s social development. 
Details of several such initiatives are 
available in the Report on Corporate 
Social Responsibility.
At RIL, Corporate Governance is 
all about maintaining a valuable 
relationship and trust with all 
the stakeholders. We consider 
stakeholders as partners in our 
success and remain committed to 
maximising stakeholders’ value, be 
it Customers, Local Communities, 
Employees, Suppliers & Distributors, 
Trade Unions, NGOs, Investors & 
Shareholders and Government & 
Regulatory Authorities. This approach 
to value creation emanates from 
RIL ’s belief that sound governance 
system, based on relationship and 
trust, is integral to creating enduring 
value for all. We have a defined 
policy framework for ethical conduct 
of businesses. We believe that any 
business conduct can be ethical only 
when it rests on the six core values 
viz. Customer Value, Ownership 
Mindset, Respect, Integrity, One Team 
and Excellence.
At RIL, we believe that as we move 
closer towards our aspirations of being 
a global corporation, our Corporate 
Governance standards must be 
globally benchmarked. Therefore, we 
have institutionalised the right building 
blocks for future growth. The building 
blocks will ensure that we achieve our 
ambition in a prudent and sustainable 
manner. RIL not only adheres to the 
prescribed Corporate Governance 
practices as per the Listing 
Regulations, but is also committed 
to sound Corporate Governance 
principles and practices. It constantly 
strives to adopt emerging best 
practices being followed worldwide. 
It is our endeavour to achieve higher 
standards and provide oversight 
and guidance to the management 
in strategy implementation, risk 
management and fulfilment of stated 
goals and objectives.
Over the years, we have strengthened 
governance practices. These practices 
define the way how business is 
conducted and value is generated. 
Stakeholders’ interests are taken into 
account before making any business 
decision. RIL has the distinction of 
consistently rewarding its shareholders 
for over four eventful decades from 
Initial Public Offer (IPO). Since then, 
RIL has moved from one big idea 
to another and these milestones 
continue to fuel its relentless pursuit 
of ever-higher goals.
On Standalone basis, we have 
grown by a Compounded Annual 
Growth Rate (CAGR) of Revenues 
22.2%, Earnings Before Interest, 
Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA) before exceptional 
items 22.9% and Net Profit before 
exceptional items 23.8%. The 
financial markets have endorsed our 
sterling performance and the market 
capitalisation has increased by CAGR 
of 30.5% during the same period. In 
terms of distributing wealth to our 
shareholders, apart from having a 
track record of uninterrupted dividend 
payout, we have also delivered 
consistent unmatched shareholder 
returns since listing. The result of our 
initiative is our ever widening reach 
and recall. Our shareholder base has 
grown from 52,000 after the IPO to a 
consolidated present base of around 
36 lakh.
For decades, RIL is growing in step 
with India’s industrial and economic 
development. The Company has 
helped transform the Indian economy 
with large projects and world-class 
execution. The quest to help elevate 
India’s quality of life continues and 
is unabated. It emanates from a 
fundamental article of faith: ‘What is 
good for India is good for Reliance’.
We believe, Corporate Governance is 
not just a destination, but a journey to 
constantly improve sustainable value 
creation. It is an upward-moving target 
that we collectively strive towards 
achieving. Our multiple initiatives 
towards maintaining the highest 
standards of governance are detailed 
in this Report.
Corporate Governance 
Structure, Policies and 
Practices
The Company has put in place an 
internal multi tier governance structure 
with defined roles and responsibilities 
of every constituent of the system. 
The Company’s shareholders appoint 
the Board of Directors, which in turn 
govern the Company. The Board has 
established various Committees to 
discharge its responsibilities in an 
effective manner. The Chairman and 
Managing Director (CMD) provides 
overall direction and guidance to 
the Board. In the operations and 
functioning of the Company, the CMD 
is assisted by Executive Directors and 
a core group of senior level executives.
“Between my past, the present and the future, there is 
one common factor: Relationship and Trust. This is the 
foundation of our growth.”

• Commodities Exposure 
  The Company is exposed to price 
volatility on various Petroleum,

policy prescribes the guidelines 
for hedging Commodities 
Price risks.

measured across the Company 
so that appropriate hedging 
can be done on a net basis. For 
Commodities hedging, there 
exist Over The Counter (OTC) 
and Exchange markets that offer 
financial instruments (derivatives), 
that enable managing the 
Price risk.
  Strategic decisions regarding the timing and the usage of derivatives 
instruments such as Swaps / Futures / Options, are taken based on 
various factors including market conditions, physical inventories, macro-
economic situation. These decisions and execution are done in line with 
the Board approved Commodities Risk Management framework. The Risk 
Management Committee has oversight on all hedging actions taken. 
  More details on Risk Management are covered under the Enterprise Risk 
Management section of the Management Discussion and Analysis Report.

subsidiaries
Major developments and business 
performance of the Company and its 
major subsidiaries consolidated with 
the Company are given below:

baskets. The business continued 
Corporate Overview   Management Review   Governance   Financial Statements

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
BOARD’S REPORT
to innovate, launch and scale up 
new retail formats to serve diverse 
customer segments.
The business recorded Gross Revenue 
of C 2,60,394 crore, a growth of 30.4% 
over last year driven by broad based 
growth across consumption baskets.
Digital Services
Digital Services segment achieved 
a record revenue of C 1,19,791 crore. 
Healthy growth in revenue from 
operations was led by full impact 
of tariff hike, continued subscriber 
addition for mobility services and 
ramp-up of wireline and digital 
services. Record EBITDA for the 
year was C 50,286 crore on account 
of higher revenue and steady 
improvement in margins.
Furthering its commitment to enable 
5G for all, Jio extended coverage of its 
True5G services to over 2,300 cities/ 
towns across India as of March 2023. 
Jio users in these cities are invited to 
experience unlimited data with up to 1 
Gbps+ speed under the Jio Welcome 
offer. Jio is on track to complete 
pan-India rollout by December 2023.
Media and Entertainment
Consolidated revenue grew 6.4% 
amidst a weak revenue environment 
and economic headwinds. Despite 
the constrained marketing budgets of 
consumer companies and start-ups 
due to high inflation and funding 
crunch respectively, advertising 
revenue of the Company was flattish 
on a Y-o-Y basis. Withdrawal of Colors 
Rishtey from the Free-To-Air DD 
FreeDish platform also had an impact 
on the advertising revenue. Movie 
production segment delivered a strong 
slate of movies and sports vertical 
made a grand debut with properties 
like FIFA World Cup and Women’s 
Premier League (WPL), driving growth 
in revenue.
Oil to Chemicals
Oil to Chemicals (O2C) business 
delivered strong performance with 
tight fuels markets offsetting weak 
downstream chemical markets. 
Revenue increased by 18.7% on 
account of higher average crude oil 
prices and improved price realisation 
for transportation fuels.
Increase in exports were led by 
higher price realisations despite lower 
downstream product volumes.
Access to global market and ability 
to place products to end consumers 
helped in realising better margins. 
Souring of advantageous crude/
feedstock from outside the region, 
given the volatility and constraints, 
lower fuel mix cost due to improved 
availability of gasifiers added to 
the margins. Introduction of SAED 
on transportation fuels adversely 
impacted earnings by C 6,648 crore on 
full year basis.
During the FY 22-23, O2C delivered 
revenue of C 5,94,650 crore and 
EBITDA of C 62,075 crore.
Oil & Gas (Exploration & 
Production)
Oil & Gas segment witnessed sharp 
improvement in Revenue & EBITDA 
with increased production and higher 
gas prices. EBITDA margin was up 
950 bps led by improved realisation. 
Domestic production was at 10-
year high.
MJ Field has started producing 
gas and condensate from Q1 
FY 2023-24. All offshore installation 
and commissioning works have 
been completed.
Lower & Upper completion campaign 
for MJ wells is progressing as per plan. 
Seven wells have been completed 
and eighth well is expected to be 
completed in Q2 FY 2023-24.
Two e-auctions for sale of 6 
MMSCMD & 5 MMSCMD gas from 
KGD6 were undertaken during the Q1 
FY24. The entire volume was sold and 
Gas Sale Purchase Agreement (GSPA) 
signed with successful bidders.
With incremental gas production 
from MJ field, along with ongoing 
production from R Cluster and 
Satellite Cluster fields, Block KG D6 
production is expected to reach ~30

A. Conservation of energy
(i)  Steps taken to conserve 
energy
  The Company considers energy 
management as one of the key 
components of its responsible 
business strategy and the 
objective has always been to 
continually improve energy 
performance of the organisation, 
consolidate these improvements, 
and move on to the next 
higher level.
  The Company has a structured 
system of monitoring energy 
usage, be it at individual 
equipment level, plant level, 
site level and at corporate level 
also with the help of dedicated 
energy teams. This monitoring 
system is seamlessly integrated 
with production control 
systems, ensuring that energy 
management is reliable, agile 
and cost efficient. This system 
is further strengthened with

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial 
Statements of RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LIMITED (“the 
Company”) which includes its joint operations, which 
comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2023, 
and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other 
Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flow 
and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then 
ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 
including a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid 
Standalone Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, 
as amended, (”Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the 
Company as at 31st March, 2023, and its profit, total 
comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the 
Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section 
of our report. We are independent of the Company in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions 
of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Standalone Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current 
period. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined 
the matters described below to be the key audit matters to 
be communicated in our report.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response
1. Estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves
Significant judgment and estimates are involved in 
estimating oil and gas reserves which require consideration of 
factors such as the availability of geological and engineering 
data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment 
activity, drilling of new wells and commodity prices. The 
quantum of oil and gas reserves have a direct impact on 
determination of depletion charge for the Company’s oil and 
gas assets and on the assessment of the recoverability of the 
carrying values of development rights. 
Accordingly, the estimation of oil and gas reserves has been 
considered as a key audit matter in view of the significant 
judgements and estimates involved.
Refer Notes B.2 (d) and Note C (A) to the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following:
• Performed walk-through of the estimation process 
associated with the oil and gas reserves. Tested the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of the controls 
established by the Company in the process of estimation of oil 
and gas reserves. 
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company’s 
internal specialists involved in estimating oil and gas reserves.
• Performed substantive testing of the depletion computation. 
Involved internal specialists to assess the reasonableness of 
valuation assumptions and appropriateness of the valuation 
methodology used in assessing the recoverability of the 
carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets included in 
intangible assets under development. 
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the 
Standalone Financial Statements for compliance with the 
applicable authoritative pronouncements.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response
2. Litigation matters
The Company has certain significant ongoing legal 
proceedings for various complex matters with the 
Government of India and other parties, continuing from 
earlier years, which are as under:
1. Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:
 (a)  Disallowance of certain costs under the production 
sharing contract, relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 
and consequent deposit of differential revenue on 
gas sales from D1D3 field to the gas pool account 
maintained by Gail (India) Limited. 
 (b)  Claim against the Company in respect of gas said to 
have migrated from neighbouring blocks (KGD6). 
 (c)  Claims relating to limits of cost recovery, profit 
sharing and audit and accounting provisions of the 
public sector corporations etc., arising under two 
production sharing contracts entered into in 1994.
 (d)  Suit for specific performance of a contract for supply 
of natural gas before the Hon’ble Bombay High Court.
  Refer Notes 36.3, and 36.4 to the Standalone Financial 
Statements.
2.  Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance 
Petroleum Limited (‘RPL’):
  Securities Appellate T ribunal judgement dated November 
5, 2020, dismissing the Company’s appeal made in 
relation to Order passed by the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of the SEBI 
Act, 1992 in connection with trades by the Company in 
the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance 
Petroleum Limited, then subsidiary of the Company.
 Refer Note 37.(IV) to the Standalone Financial Statements.
 Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, 
management’s judgement regarding recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal 
proceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over 
time as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following:
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls established by the Company in the process of 
evaluation of litigation matters.
• Assessed the management’s position through discussions 
with the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions 
obtained by the Company (where considered necessary) on 
both, the probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the 
magnitude of any potential loss. 
• Discussed with the management on the developments in 
respect of these litigations during the year ended 31 st March 
2023 till the date of approval of the financial statements. 
• Rolled out of enquiry letters to the Company’s legal counsel 
and assessed the responses received. 
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Company’s 
legal counsel involved in the process. 
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Company in the 
financial statements. 
• Obtained Management representation letter on the 
assessment of these matters.
3. Fair Valuation of Investments
As at 31st March, 2023, the Company has investments of 
C 78,093 crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital 
Fibre Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair 
value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair 
value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination 
of fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and 
input from data that is not directly observable in the market. 
Further, the fair value is significantly influenced by the 
expected pattern of future benefits of the tangible assets of 
JDFPL (fibre assets). 
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Refer Notes 2 and 39A to the Standalone Financial 
Statements.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls established by the Company in the process of 
determination of fair value of the investments.
• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the 
management by involvement of internal valuation specialists.
• Assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts 
including discount rates, expected growth rates and its 
effect on business and terminal growth rates used and the 
valuation methodology inter-alia through involvement of the 
internal specialists.
• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared 
to previous year / actual performance with management 
to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash 
flow forecasts.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal 
specialist and Company’s external experts involved in 
the process.

4. Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally 
reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant 
transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and 
raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction 
volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity 
of the Company’s systems and data, cyber security has 
become more significant. Automated accounting procedures 
and IT environment controls, which include IT governance, 
IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations, IT application 
controls and interfaces between IT applications, are required 
to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate 
financial reporting.
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:
• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Company and identified IT applications 
that are relevant to our audit.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.
• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity at 
the Company in respect of the overall security architecture and 
any key threats addressed by the Company in the current year.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT application controls in the key processes impacting 
financial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Information Other than the Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
• The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
• Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
• In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company 
in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility 
also includes maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation 
and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of 
the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Company has adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or 
in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the 
Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative 
factors (i) in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the 
effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone 
Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the current year and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
The Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for 
the year ended 31st March, 2022, prepared in accordance 
with Ind AS have been audited by the predecessor auditors. 
The report of the predecessor auditors dated 6th May, 2022,

which includes its joint operations as of 31st March, 2023 
in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the Company for the year ended on

Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of 
its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of 
frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements of the Company based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the 
Standards on Auditing prescribed under -section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
With reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls With reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements 
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all 
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 31st 
March, 2023, based on the criteria for internal financial 
control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants

A. Corporate Information
  Reliance Industries Limited (“the Company”) is a listed 
entity incorporated in India. The registered office of 
the Company is located at 3rd Floor, Maker Chambers 
IV, 222, Nariman Point, Mumbai - 400 021, India.
  The Company is engaged in activities spanning 
across hydrocarbon exploration and production, Oil to 
Chemicals, Retail and Digital Services.
B. Significant Accounting Policies:
B.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation
  The Financial Statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis except for following assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair 
value amount:
 i)  Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities (including 
derivative instruments),
 ii) Defined Benefit Plans – Plan Assets and
 iii) Equity settled Share Based Payments
  The Financial Statements of the Company have 
been prepared to comply with the Indian Accounting 
standards (‘Ind AS’), including the rules notified under 
the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, 
(as amended from time to time) and Presentation and 
disclosure requirements of Division II of Schedule III to 
the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS Compliant Schedule 
III) as amended from time to time.
  The Company’s Financial Statements are presented in 
Indian Rupees (C), which is also its functional currency 
and all values are rounded to the nearest crore 
(C00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.
B.2  Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies
 (a) Current and Non-Current Classification
   The Company presents assets and liabilities 
in the Balance Sheet based on Current/ 
Non-Current classification.
  An asset is treated as Current when it is –
  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
  All other assets are classified as non-current.
  A liability is current when:
  -  It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle;
  -  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
   The Company classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current.
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
 (b) Property, Plant and Equipment
   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at 
cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount 
and rebates less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the assets to 
its working condition for its intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations 
attributable to the assets. In case of land the 
Company has availed fair value as deemed cost 
on the date of transition to Ind AS.
   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the entity and the cost can be 
measured reliably.
   Property, Plant and Equipment which are 
significant to the total cost of that item of 
Property, Plant and Equipment and having 
different useful life are accounted separately.
   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to 
project, net of income earned during the project 
development stage prior to its intended use, 
are considered as pre-operative expenses and 
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.
   Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment 
is provided using written down value method 
on depreciable amount except in case of certain 
assets of Oil to Chemicals and Other segment 
which are depreciated using straight line method. 
Depreciation is provided based on useful life of 
the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the 
following assets, where useful life is different 
than those prescribed in Schedule II;
Particular Depreciation
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: 2 years or more)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: up to 2 years)
100% depreciated in the 
year of addition
Plant and Machinery (useful 
life: 25 to 50 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Buildings (Useful life : 30 to 
65 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
   The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment 
are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a 
Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the asset is derecognised.
 (c) Leases
   The Company, as a lessee, recognises a 
right-of-use asset and a lease liability for its 
leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset.
   The contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset, if it involves the use 
of an identified asset and the Company has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from 
use of the asset and has right to direct the use 
of the identified asset. The cost of the right-of-
use asset shall comprise of the amount of the 
initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date plus any initial direct costs 
incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation/ amortisation, accumulated 
impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any 
remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-
of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised using the 
straight-line method from the commencement 
date over the shorter of lease term or useful life 
of right-of-use asset.
   The Company measures the lease liability at 
the present value of the lease payments that 
are not paid at the commencement date of 
the lease. The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if 
that rate can be readily determined. If that rate 
cannot be readily determined, the Company uses 
incremental borrowing rate.
   For short-term and low value leases, the 
Company recognises the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
 (d) Intangible Assets
   Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and 
rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion 
and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to 
its working condition for the intended use, 
net charges on foreign exchange contracts 
and adjustments arising from exchange rate 
variations attributable to the Intangible Assets.
   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the entity and the cost can be 
measured reliably.
   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an 
Intangible Asset are measured as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
asset is derecognised. The Company’s intangible 
assets comprises assets with finite useful life 
which are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the period of their expected useful life.
   A summary of amortisation/depletion policies 
applied to the Company’s Intangible Assets to 
the extent of depreciable amount is as follows:
Particular Amortisation / Depletion
T echnical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years.
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 years.
Development 
Rights
W.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the 
unit of production method. The cost of 
producing wells along with its related 
facilities including decommissioning 
costs are depleted in proportion of oil 
and gas production achieved vis-à-vis 
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost 
for common facilities including its 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
using Proved Reserves. W.r.t. other 
development rights, amortized over the 
period of contract.
Others In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than 
the aggregate rebate availed by the 
Company.

328 329
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
   The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at each reporting date.
 (e) Research and Development Expenditure
   Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as 
and when incurred.
   Development costs are capitalised as an 
intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that 
the project is expected to generate future 
economic benefits, it is probable that those 
future economic benefits will flow to the entity 
and the costs of the asset can be measured 
reliably, else it is charged to the Statement of 
Profit and Loss.
 (f) Cash and Cash Equivalents
   Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash on 
hand, cash at banks, short-term deposits and 
short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
 (g) Finance Costs
   Borrowing costs include exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the 
interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the 
cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that 
necessarily takes substantial period of time to get 
ready for its intended use.
   Interest income earned on the temporary 
investment of specific borrowings pending 
their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible 
for capitalisation.
   All other borrowing costs are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for 
which they are incurred.
 (h) Inventories
   Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing 
for obsolescence, if any, except in case of 
by-products which are valued at net realisable 
value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of 
purchase, cost of conversion and other costs 
including manufacturing overheads net of 
recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to 
their respective present location and condition.
   Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
 (i)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
- Property, Plant and Equipment and 
Intangible Assets
   The Company assesses at each reporting 
date as to whether there is any indication 
that any Property, Plant and Equipment and 
Intangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash 
Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine 
the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of 
an individual asset, the Company estimates the 
recoverable amount of the CGU to which the 
asset belongs.
   An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an 
asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in 
use. Value in use is based on the estimated future 
cash flows, discounted to their present value 
using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and risk specific to the assets.
   The impairment loss recognised in prior 
accounting period is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimate of recoverable amount.
 (j) Provisions
   Provisions are recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost.
  Provision for Decommissioning Liability
   The Company records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of future expenditure using 
a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred 
to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the underlying 
assets. Any change in the present value of the 
expenditure, other than unwinding of discount 
on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to 
the provision and the corresponding asset. The 
change in the provision due to the unwinding of 
discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
 (k) Contingent Liabilities
   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that arises from past events where it is 
either not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot 
be made.
 (l) Employee Benefits Expense
  Short-Term Employee Benefits
   The undiscounted amount of short-term 
employee benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for the services rendered by employees 
are recognised as an expense during the period 
when the employees render the services.
  Post-Employment Benefits
  Defined Contribution Plans
   The Company recognises contribution payable 
to the provident fund scheme as an expense, 
when an employee renders the related service. 
If the contribution payable to the scheme for 
service received before the balance sheet date 
exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognised 
as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment 
will lead to a reduction in future payment or a 
cash refund.
  Defined Benefit Plans
   The Company pays gratuity to the employees 
who have completed five years of service 
with the Company at the time of resignation/
superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days 
basic salary for every completed year of service 
as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The 
gratuity liability amount is contributed to the 
approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for 
gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity 
fund has been approved by respective Income 
Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity 
and other post-employment benefits is calculated 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method and 
spread over the period during which the benefit is 
expected to be derived from employees’ services.
   Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in 
the period in which they occur in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
   Employee Separation Costs: The Company 
recognises the employee separation cost when 
the scheme is announced, and the Company is 
demonstrably committed to it.
 (m) Tax Expenses
   The tax expenses for the period comprises of 
current tax and deferred income tax. Tax is 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, 
except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. 
In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
  i. Current Tax
    Current tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the Income Tax 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that 
are enacted at the Balance sheet date.
  ii. Deferred Tax
    Deferred tax is recognised on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the Financial 
Statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit.
    Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax losses can be 
utilised. Deferred tax liabilities and assets 
are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period. The 
carrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities 
and assets are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period.
 (n) Share Based Payments
   Equity-settled share based payments to 
employees and others providing similar services 
are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. Details regarding 
the determination of the fair value of equity-
Corporate Overview   Management Review   Governance   Financial Statements
Standalone
NOTES  
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
330 331
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
settled share based payments transactions are 
set out in Note 29.2.
   The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Company’s estimate of 
equity instruments that will eventually vest, 
with a corresponding increase in equity. At the 
end of each reporting period, the Company 
revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of 
the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such 
that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the 
Share Based Payments Reserve.
   The dilutive effect of outstanding options is 
reflected as additional share dilution in the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.
   In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company 
grants stock options to the employees of its 
subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted by 
increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary 
with a corresponding credit in the equity.
 (o)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the functional currency closing rates of 
exchange at the reporting date. Exchange 
differences arising on settlement or translation of 
monetary items are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange 
differences which are regarded as an adjustment 
to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or construction of qualifying assets which 
are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, 
exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost 
of such assets.
   Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
recorded using the exchange rates at the date of 
the transaction. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising 
on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income or Statement 
of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit 
and Loss, respectively).
   In case of an asset, expense or income where a 
non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date 
of transaction is the date on which the advance 
was initially recognised. If there were multiple 
payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates 
of transactions are determined for each payment 
or receipt of advance consideration.
 (p) Revenue Recognition
   Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services. The 
Company is generally the principal as it typically 
controls the goods or services before transferring 
them to the customer.
   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment 
of goods to the customer or when the goods 
is made available to the customer, provided 
transfer of title to the customer occurs and the 
Company has not retained any significant risks of 
ownership or future obligations with respect to 
the goods shipped.
   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
over time by measuring the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations 
at the reporting period.
   Revenue is measured at the amount of 
consideration which the Company expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to a customer as specified in 
the contract, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties (for example taxes and 
duties collected on behalf of the government). 
Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction 
of performance obligations and a receivable 
is recognised when it becomes unconditional. 
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods 
or services as the case may be. The Company 
provides volume rebates to certain customers 
once the quantity of products purchased during 
the period exceeds a threshold specified and 
also accrues discounts to certain customers 
based on customary business practices which 
is derived on the basis of crude price volatility 
and various market demand – supply situations. 
Consideration are determined based on its most 
likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum 
products contain provisional pricing features 
where revenue is initially recognised based on 
provisional price.
   Difference between final settlement price and 
provisional price is recognised subsequently. The 
Company does not adjust short-term advances 
received from the customer for the effects of 
significant financing component if it is expected 
at the contract inception that the promised good 
or service will be transferred to the customer 
within a period of one year.
  Contract Balances
  Trade Receivables
   A receivable represents the Company’s right to 
an amount of consideration that is unconditional.
  Contract Liabilities
   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer 
goods or services to a customer for which 
the Company has received consideration or 
is due from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Company transfers 
goods or services to the customer, a contract 
liability is recognised when the payment is made 
or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).
   Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue 
when the Company performs under the contract.
  Interest Income
   Interest Income from a Financial Assets is 
recognised using effective interest rate method.
  Dividend Income
   Dividend Income is recognised when the 
Company’s right to receive the amount has 
been established.
 (q) Financial Instruments
  i.  Financial Assets
  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement
    All Financial Assets are initially recognised at 
fair value. Transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
Financial Assets, which are not at Fair Value 
Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the 
fair value on initial recognition. Purchase 
and sale of Financial Assets are recognised 
using trade date accounting. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component are measured at 
transaction price.
  B.  Subsequent Measurement
   a)  Financial Assets measured at 
Amortised Cost (AC)
     A Financial Asset is measured at 
Amortised Cost if it is held within a 
business model whose objective is 
to hold the asset in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the Financial Asset 
give rise to cash flows on specified 
dates that represent solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
   b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair 
Value Through Other Comprehensive 
Income (FVTOCI)
     A Financial Asset is measured at 
FVTOCI if it is held within a business 
model whose objective is achieved by 
both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling Financial Assets and the 
contractual terms of the Financial Asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that represents solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
   c)  Financial Assets measured at 
Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
(FVTPL)
     A Financial Asset which is not classified 
in any of the above categories are 
measured at FVTPL. Financial assets 
are reclassified subsequent to their 
recognition, if the Company changes 
its business model for managing 
those financial assets. Changes in 
business model are made and applied 
prospectively from the reclassification 
date following the changes in business 
model in accordance with principles 
laid down under Ind AS 109 – 
Financial Instruments.
  C.  Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and 
Joint Ventures
    The Company has accounted for its 
investments in Subsidiaries, associates and 
joint venture at cost less impairment loss (if 
any). The investments in preference shares 
with the right of surplus assets which are 
in nature of equity in accordance with Ind 
AS 32 are treated as separate category of 
investment and measured at FVTOCI.

to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
332 333
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
  D. Other Equity Investments
    All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except 
for those equity investments for which 
the Company has elected to present the 
value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive 
Income’. However, dividend on such equity 
investments are recognised in Statement of 
Profit and loss when the Company’s right to 
receive payment is established.
  E. Impairment of Financial Assets
    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the 
Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ 
(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of 
Financial Assets other than those measured 
at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss 
(FVTPL).
    Expected Credit Losses are measured 
through a loss allowance at an amount 
equal to:
• The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or
• Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the life of the 
financial instrument).
    For Trade Receivables the Company 
applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables.
    The Company uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed.
    For other assets, the Company uses 12 
month ECL to provide for impairment loss 
where there is no significant increase in 
credit risk. If there is significant increase in 
credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.
  ii.  Financial Liabilities
  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement
    All Financial Liabilities are recognised at 
fair value and in case of borrowings, net of 
directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring 
nature are directly recognised in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.
  B.  Subsequent Measurement
    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. For 
trade and other payables maturing within 
one year from the balance sheet date, the 
carrying amounts approximate fair value due 
to the short maturity of these instruments.
  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting
    The Company uses various derivative 
financial instruments such as interest 
rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards 
& options and commodity contracts to 
mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, 
exchange rates and commodity prices. 
At the inception of a hedge relationship, 
the Company formally designates and 
documents the hedge relationship to 
which the Company wishes to apply hedge 
accounting and the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge. Such derivative financial instruments 
are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are also subsequently 
measured at fair value.
    Derivatives are carried as Financial Assets 
when the fair value is positive and as 
Financial Liabilities when the fair value is 
negative. Any gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
taken directly to Statement of Profit and 
Loss, except for the effective portion of 
cash flow hedge which is recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income and later 
to Statement of Profit and Loss when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss or is 
treated as basis adjustment if a hedged 
forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or 
Non-Financial liability.
    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows:
  A. Cash Flow Hedge
    The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments 
to mitigate the risk of movement in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for foreign exchange exposure on highly 
probable future cash flows attributable to 
a recognised asset or liability or forecast 
cash transactions.
    When a derivative is designated as a cash 
flow hedging instrument, the effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of 
the derivative is recognised in the cash 
flow hedging reserve being part of Other 
Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the 
derivative is recognised immediately in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging 
relationship no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold or terminated 
or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in 
cash flow hedging reserve till the period 
the hedge was effective remains in cash 
flow hedging reserve until the underlying 
transaction occurs. The cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the cash 
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss upon the 
occurrence of the underlying transaction. 
If the forecasted transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, then the amount 
accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve 
is reclassified in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
  B. Fair Value Hedge
    The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments 
to mitigate the risk of change in fair value 
of hedged item due to movement in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and 
commodity prices.
    Changes in the fair value of hedging 
instruments and hedged items that are 
designated and qualify as fair value hedges 
are recorded in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
the adjustment to the carrying amount of a 
hedged item for which the effective interest 
method is used is amortised to Statement of 
Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.
  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments
    The Company derecognises a Financial 
Asset when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the Financial Asset expire 
or it transfers the Financial Asset and the 
transfer qualifies for derecognition under 
Ind AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part 
of a Financial liability) is derecognised 
from the Company’s Balance Sheet when 
the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
  v.  Offsetting
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Company has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the amount and it intends, either to 
settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale
   Non-current assets are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use and sale is considered 
highly probable.
   A sale is considered as highly probable when 
decision has been made to sell, assets are 
available for immediate sale in its present 
condition, assets are being actively marketed 
and sale has been agreed or is expected to 
be concluded within 12 months of the date 
of classification.
   Non-current assets held for sale are neither 
depreciated nor amortised.
   Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less cost of disposal and are 
presented separately in the Balance Sheet.
 (s) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
   The Company has adopted Successful Efforts 
Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas 
activities. The policy of recognition of exploration 
and evaluation expenditure is considered in 
line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, 
geological and geophysical studies, petroleum 
exploration license fees and general and 
administration costs directly attributable to 
exploration and evaluation activities are expensed 
off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest 
in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and 
evaluation other than those which are expensed 
off are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under 
Development. All development costs incurred 
in respect of proved reserves are also capitalised 
under Intangible Assets Under Development. 
Once a well is ready to commence commercial 
production, the costs accumulated in Intangible 
Assets Under Development are classified as 
Intangible Assets corresponding to proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration 
and evaluation expenditure which does not result 
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all 
cost pertaining to production are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
   The Company uses technical estimation of 
reserves as per the Petroleum Resources 
Management System guidelines 2011 and 
standard geological and reservoir engineering 
methods. The reserve review and evaluation is 
carried out annually.
   Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature 
of joint operations. Accordingly, assets and 
liabilities as well as income and expenditure are 
accounted on the basis of available information 
on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the 
Company’s Financial Statements, according to 
the participating interest of the Company.
 (t) Earnings Per Share
   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing 
the net profit after tax by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures 
used in determination of basic earnings per share 
to take into account the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as at the beginning 
of the period unless issued at a later date.
C.  Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources Of Estimation Uncertainty
  The preparation of the Company’s Financial 
Statements requires management to make 
judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets 
and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. 
Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates 
could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or 
liabilities affected in next financial years.
(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
  The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves requires significant judgements 
and estimates to be applied and these are regularly 
reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability 
of geological and engineering data, reservoir 
performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, 
drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact 
on the determination of the Company’s estimates of 
its oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases 
it’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement 
of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and 
commercial assessments based on conventional 
industry practice and regulatory requirements.
  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used 
to calculate depletion charges for the Company’s 
oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in 
estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively 
by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. Oil and 
natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the 
assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying 
values reported in the Financial Statements.
  Details on proved reserves and production both 
on product and geographical basis are provided in 
Note 36.2.
(B) Decommissioning Liabilities
  The liability for decommissioning costs is recognised 
when the Company has an obligation to perform site 
restoration activity. The recognition and measurement 
of decommissioning provisions involves the use of 
estimates and assumptions. These include; the timing 
of abandonment of well and related facilities which 
would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, 
expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope 
of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied 
for discounting.
(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible 
Assets
  Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by the management. 
Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are 
depreciated/amortised over their estimated useful 
life, after taking into account estimated residual 
value. Management reviews the estimated useful life 
and residual values of the assets annually in order to 
determine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation 
to be recorded during any reporting period. The 
useful life and residual values are based on the 
Company’s historical experience with similar assets 
and take into account anticipated technological and 
future risks. The depreciation/amortisation for future 
periods is revised if there are significant changes from 
previous estimates.
(D)  Recoverability of Trade Receivables
  Judgments are required in assessing the recoverability 
of overdue trade receivables and determining whether 
a provision against those receivables is required. 
Factors considered include the credit rating of the 
counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated 
future payments and any possible actions that can be 
taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.
(E) Provisions
  The timing of recognition and quantification of the 
liability (including litigations) requires the application 
of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, 
which can be subject to change. The carrying 
amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed 
regularly and revised to take account of changing 
facts and circumstances.
(F)  Impairment of Financial and 
Non-Financial Assets
  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets 
are based on assumptions about risk of default 
and expected cash loss rates. The Company uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on Company’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the 
end of each reporting period.
  In case of non-financial assets, assessment of 
impairment indicators involves consideration of 
future risks. Further, the company estimates asset’s 
recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or 
Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of 
disposal and its value in use.
  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account, if no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used.
(G)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and 
Liabilities
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
temporary differences and unused tax losses for 
which there is probability of utilisation against the 
future taxable profit. The Company uses judgement 
to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level 
of future taxable profits and business developments.
(H) Fair Value Measurement
  For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer note 39 of financial statements.
D.  Standards Issued but not Effective

Expected rate of return on Plan Assets (per annum) 7.60% 7.09%
Rate of escalation in Salary (per annum) 6% 6%
Rate of employee turnover (per annum) 3% 2%
The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information 
is certified by the actuary.
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the 
composition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Company’s policy for 
Plan Assets Management.
  VII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with FY 2022-23.
  VIII) Sensitivity Analysis
    Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected 
salary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably 
possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions 
constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:
As at 31st March, 2023 As at 31st March, 2022
Decrease Increase Decrease Increase
Change in rate of discounting (delta effect of +/- 0.5%) 21 22 24 26
Change in rate of salary increase (delta effect of -/+ 0.5%) 22 23 25 26
Change in rate of employee turnover (delta effect of -/+ 
0.5%)
2 2 2 2
    These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and 
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate 
of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life 
expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
 29.2 Share Based Payments

 36.3  The Government of India (GOI), by its letters dated 2nd May, 2012, 14th November, 2013, 10th July, 2014 and 3rd June 2016 
has disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 entitles the 
Company to recover. The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the 
terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined 
in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI 
of $ 165 million (C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional 
Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023. 
The next date of hearing is awaited.
   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified 
the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26 th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to 
instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under 
the guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be 
credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool 
Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in 
respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been 
challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.
 36.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately 
US$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on 
behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair 
claim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an appeal 
on 15th November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the 
Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the 
Arbitration Award dated 24th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI’s appeal.
  (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI on 16th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts (‘PSCs’) for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks 
due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by 
majority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, 
2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 
16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral 
Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 (‘2018 
FPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English 
Commercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and 
remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable 
award on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements 
Case Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9 th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application 
before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral 
Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which 
will take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. 
    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and 
execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The 
Claimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition 
before the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon’ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking 
enforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12 th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) 
relating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.
  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for 
a period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses 
in the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.
    Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible 
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ 
litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, 
then a subsidiary of RIL. Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) of SEBI in respect of the SCN. By an 
order dated March 24, 2017 , the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the 
‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the order; and 
(ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007 till 
the date of payment. In May 2017 , RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) 
against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 and directed RIL to pay the disgorged 
amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other noticees has been admitted by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17 , 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 
crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of 
interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17 , 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. 
In the very same matter, on November 21, 2017 , SEBI issued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to 
why inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) 
Rules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed under the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The

under protest and has filed an appeal before the SAT against this order.

Level 2 85,375 79,857
Level 3 2,626 3,137
  For current borrowings, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
   The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value 
measurements as described below:
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
   Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly; and
  Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
  Valuation Methodology
  All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
  a)  The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of 
Deposit and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
  b)  The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves.
  c)  The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward 
exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
  d)  The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
  e)  Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, 
brokers and price index developers.
  f)  The fair value for level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants 
assumptions and other data that are available.
  g)  The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
  h)  All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.
 B. Financial Risk Management
   The company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. 
Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Company uses derivative instruments to 
manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance.
  i) Market Risk
    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as 
equity price risk and commodity risk.
   a) Foreign Currency Risk
     Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.
     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial 
instruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

  ii) Commodity Price Risk
    Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products. The company has 
a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and 
freight costs.
    The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. 
In accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses 
over-the-counter as well as Exchange T raded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight 
exposure.
  iii) Credit Risk
    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due 
causing financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives 
and receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate 
creditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit 
information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify 
and respond to cases of credit deterioration.
    The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, 
advance payments and factoring & forfeiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The 
company restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
  iv) Liquidity Risk
    Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company 
maintains sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global 
and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to 
ensure efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. T reasury monitors rolling forecasts 
of the company’s cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times 
including contingencies.
    The company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. 
T reasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net 
deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank 
deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified 
to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.

 C. Hedge Accounting
   The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and 
other feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a 
structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting 
framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and 
options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.
   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established 
a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical 
derivative method and critical term matching method.
  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. 
  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
CONSOLIDATED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Reliance Industries Limited 
(”the Parent”) which includes joint operations and its 
subsidiaries, (the Parent and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as “the Group”), and the Group’s share of 
profit / loss in its associates and joint ventures, which 
comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 
2023, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
(including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow and the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based 
on the consideration of reports of the other auditors on 
separate / consolidated financial statements / financial 
information of the subsidiaries, associates and joint 
ventures referred to in the Other Matters section below, 
the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements give 
the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a true 
and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting 
Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read 
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group as at 31st March, 2023, 
and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total 
comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and 
their consolidated changes in equity for the year ended on 
that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
specified under Section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint 
ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
current year. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key 
audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response
1. Estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves
Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating 
oil and gas reserves which require consideration of factors 
such as the availability of geological and engineering data, 
reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, 
drilling of new wells and commodity prices. The quantum of 
oil and gas reserves have a direct impact on determination of 
depletion charge for the Parent's oil and gas assets and on 
the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying values of 
development rights. 
Accordingly, the estimation of oil and gas reserves has been 
considered as a key audit matter in view of the significant 
judgements and estimates involved. 
Refer Notes B.3 (e) and C(A) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following:-
• Performed walk-through of the estimation process 
associated with the oil and gas reserves. Tested the design, 
implementation and operating effectiveness of the controls 
established by the Parent in the process of estimation of oil and 
gas reserves.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent's 
internal specialists involved in estimating oil and gas reserves.
• Performed substantive testing of the depletion computation. 
Involved internal specialists to assess the reasonableness of 
valuation assumptions and appropriateness of the valuation 
methodology used in assessing the recoverability of the 
carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets included in 
intangible assets under development.
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for compliance with the 
applicable authoritative pronouncements.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response
2. Depreciation / amortisation of spectrum and related 
tangible assets
The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), a 
step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported a key audit 
matter on amortization / depreciation of spectrum costs and 
related tangible assets. Spectrum costs and the related tangible 
assets are amortised / depreciated to appropriately reflect the 
expected pattern of consumption of expected future economic 
benefits from continued use of the said assets. Determination 
of rate of amortisation / depreciation involves significant 
judgement and estimates and use of technology. Accordingly, 
it has been considered as a key audit matter. 
Refer Notes B.3 (e) and C(C) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
In respect of the key audit matter reported by the auditors of 
RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by 
the auditors of RJIL to address the key audit matter. As reported 
by the subsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been 
performed by them:-
• Tested design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls over determination of expected economic benefits 
from the use of relevant assets and monitoring actual 
consumption thereof to true-up the expected pattern of 
consumption during an accounting period.
• Involved internal Telecom and IT specialists to assess the 
reasonableness of the expected pattern of consumption 
of the expected economic benefits emanating from the 
use of the relevant assets and the IT environment over the 
relevant application systems used in monitoring the actual 
consumption thereof.
• Substantive testing procedures included, verifying the 
mathematical accuracy of computation of amortisation /
depreciation charge for the year.
3. Litigation matters
The Parent has certain significant ongoing legal proceedings 
for various complex matters with the Government of India and 
other parties, continuing from earlier years, which are as under:
1. Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:
 (a)  Disallowance of certain costs under the production 
sharing contract, relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 
and consequent deposit of differential revenue on 
gas sales from D1D3 field to the gas pool account 
maintained by Gail (India) Limited. 
 (b)   Claim against the Parent in respect of gas said to 
have migrated from neighbouring blocks (KGD6).
 (c)   Claims relating to limits of cost recovery, profit 
sharing and audit and accounting provisions of the 
public sector corporations etc., arising under two 
production sharing contracts entered into in 1994. 
 (d)   Suit for specific performance of a contract for 
supply of natural gas before the Hon’ble Bombay 
High Court. 
  Refer Notes 35.3 and 35.4 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
2.   Matter relating to trading in shares of Reliance 
Petroleum Limited (‘RPL’):
  Securities Appellate T ribunal judgement dated November 
5, 2020, dismissing the Parent's appeal made in relation 
to Order passed by the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 
in connection with trades by the Parent in the stock 
exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum 
Limited, then subsidiary of the Parent.
  Refer Note 36 (III) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
 Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, 
management’s judgement regarding recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these legal 
proceedings is inherently uncertain and might change over 
time as the outcomes of the legal cases are determined.
 Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. 
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following:-
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls established by the Parent in the process of 
evaluation of litigation matters.
• Assessed the management’s position through discussions 
with the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions 
obtained by the Parent (where considered necessary) on both, 
the probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the 
magnitude of any potential loss.
• Discussed with the management on the developments in 
respect of these litigations during the year ended 31 st March 
2023 till the date of approval of the Parent's Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
• Rolled out enquiry letters to the Parent's legal counsel and 
assessed the responses received.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of the Parent's legal 
counsel involved in the process.
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
• Obtained Management Representation Letter on the 
assessment of these matters.

4. Fair Valuation of Investments
As at 31st March 2023, the Parent has investments of C 78,093 
crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fibre 
Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair value as 
per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair 
value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination 
of fair value is based on a high degree of judgement and input 
from data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, 
the fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern 
of future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets). 
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter. 
Refer Notes 2 and 38A to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to the following:-
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls established by the Parent in the process of 
determination of fair value of the investments.
• Reviewed the fair valuation reports provided by the 
management by involvement of internal valuation specialists.
• Assessed the assumptions around the cash flow forecasts 
including discount rates, expected growth rates and its 
effect on business and terminal growth rates used and the 
valuation methodology inter-alia through involvement of the 
internal specialists.
• Discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared 
to previous year / actual performance with management 
to evaluate the inputs and assumptions used in the cash 
flow forecasts.
• Assessed the objectivity and competence of our internal 
specialist and Parent’s external experts involved in the process.
• Reviewed the disclosures made by the Parent in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards the 
fair valuation of these investments.
5. Revenue Recognition
(a)  The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), 
a step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported 
revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high 
volumes of data processed by the IT systems and the 
complexity of those IT systems.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors 
of RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed 
by them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the 
subsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been performed 
by them:-
• Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the relevant business process 
controls, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement 
and authorization of revenue transactions, involving internal 
Information Technology (IT) specialists for the automated 
controls, interface controls and reports generated through 
various relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.
• Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment 
inter-alia for access controls, change management and 
application specific controls in the IT Systems over the 
Company's billing and other relevant support systems.
• Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue 
per the billing system and the financial records. Performed 
procedures to test the computation of revenue and 
deferred revenue.
(b)  The auditors of Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’), a step-
down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue 
recognition as a key audit matter. RRL is engaged in 
organised retail and the trading transactions generating 
revenue comprise of high volume of individually small 
transactions which increases the risk of revenue being 
recognised inappropriately and which highlights the 
criticality of sound internal processes of summarising 
and recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption 
baskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of 
consideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised 
on transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. 
T ransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or 
cash equivalent from customers. In view of the above 
and since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, 
revenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of 
RRL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by 
them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary 
auditors, the following procedure have been performed by them:-
• Obtained understanding of the process followed by the 
management to record the revenue from each store.
• Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
the internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of 
revenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.
• Involved information technology specialist to test the 
automated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation 
of revenue.
• On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various 
dates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue recorded 
through various modes of payment from RRL ’s accounting 
system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such details with 
the underlying collection made by RRL as per cash receipts, 
merchant payment reports, and other third party supporting.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response
6. Information T echnology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant on 
IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction 
volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material 
consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and 
the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s 
systems and data, cyber security has become more significant. 
Automated accounting procedures and IT environment 
controls, which include IT governance, IT general controls over 
program development and changes, access to program and 
data and IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces 
between IT applications, are required to be designed and to 
operate effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:-
• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that 
are relevant to our audit.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.
• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity 
at the Parent in respect of the overall security architecture and 
any key threats addressed by the Parent in the current year.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT application controls in the key processes impacting 
financial reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Information Other than the Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
• The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
• Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
• In connection with our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information, compare with the financial 
statements / financial information of the joint operations, 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates audited by the 
other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities 
and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other 
auditors and consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial 
Statements or our knowledge obtained during the 
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. Other information so far as it relates to 
the joint operations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, is traced from their financial statements / 
financial information audited by the other auditors. 
  If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and 
consolidated changes in equity of the Group including its 
associates and joint ventures in accordance with the Ind 
AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associates and joint 
ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its 
associates and its joint ventures and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and 
application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the financial statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for 
the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective 
Corporate Overview   Management Review   Governance   Financial Statements
Consolidated

CONSOLIDATED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective 
Board of Directors either intends to liquidate their 
respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies 
included in the Group and of its associates and joint 
ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group and of its associates and 
joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing 
our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal 
financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group 
and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of 
the financial statements of such entities or business 
activities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities or business activities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have 
been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
 Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in 
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect 
of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Parent and such other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with 
a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to 
communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the current year and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

To The Independent Auditor’s Report 
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
CONSOLIDATED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-
section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Parent”) as of and for the year ended 31st 
March, 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of 
the Parent and its subsidiary companies, its associate 
companies and joint ventures, which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent, its 
subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint 
ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements based on the internal control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements criteria established 
by the respective Companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint ventures, which are 
companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and 
the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 
143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance 
Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of 
the subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint 
ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, in 
terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies 
and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated 
in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance 
with authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that 
the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us and based on 
the consideration of the reports of the other auditors 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the 
Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies 
and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in 
India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were 
operating effectively as at 31st March, 2023, based on 
the criteria for internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements established by 
the respective companies considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on 
the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements insofar as it relates to 123 subsidiary companies, 
36 associate companies and 15 joint ventures, which are 
companies incorporated in India, is based solely on the 
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies 
incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the 
above matters.

418 419
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
A. Corporate Information
  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise 
financial statements of “Reliance Industries Limited” 
(“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively 
referred to as “the Group”) for the year ended 31st 
March, 2023.
  The Company is a listed entity incorporated in India. 
The registered office of the Company is located at 
3rd Floor, Maker Chambers IV, 222, Nariman Point, 
Mumbai - 400 021, India.
  The principal activities of the Group, its joint ventures 
and associates consist of Oil to Chemicals (O2C), Oil 
and Gas, Retail and Digital Services. Further details 
about the business operations of the Group are 
provided in Note 39 – Segment Information.
B. Significant Accounting Policies
B.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation
  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis except for the 
following assets and liabilities which have been 
measured at fair value:
 i.  Certain financial assets and liabilities (including 
derivative instruments),
 ii. Defined Benefit Plan’s – Plan Assets and
 iii. Equity settled Share Based Payments
  The Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Group have been prepared in accordance with 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and 
presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule 
III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant 
Schedule III), as applicable to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
  The Consolidated Financial Statements comprises 
of Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, 
being the entities that it controls. Control is assessed 
in accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 – 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
  The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented 
in Indian Rupees (C) and all values are rounded 
to the nearest crore (C 00,00,000), except when 
otherwise indicated.
B.2 Principles of Consolidation
 (a)  The financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis 
by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after 
fully eliminating intra-group balances and intra-
group transactions.
 (b)  Profits or losses resulting from intra-group  
transactions that are recognised in assets, such 
as Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, 
are eliminated in full.
 (c)  In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are 
consolidated at the average rate prevailing during 
the year. All assets and liabilities are converted 
at rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any 
exchange difference arising on consolidation is 
recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation 
Reserve (FCTR).
 (d)  The audited/unaudited financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates 
have been prepared in accordance with the 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principle of its 
Country of Incorporation or Ind AS.
 (e)  The differences in accounting policies of the 
Company and its subsidiaries/joint ventures/ 
associates are not material and there are no 
material transactions from 1st January, 2023 to 
31st March, 2023 in respect of subsidiaries/joint 
ventures/associates having financial year ended 
31st December, 2022.
 (f)  The Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared using uniform accounting 
policies for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances.
 (g)  The carrying amount of the parent’s investment 
in each subsidiary is offset (eliminated) against 
the parent’s portion of equity in each subsidiary.
 (h)  The difference between the proceeds from 
disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the 
carrying amount of its assets less liabilities as 
on the date of disposal is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being 
the profit or loss on disposal of investment 
in subsidiary.
 (i)  Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has 
been accounted under the Equity Method as per 
Ind AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures. Investments in joint operations are 
accounted using the Proportionate Consolidation 
Method as per Ind AS 111 – Joint Arrangements.
 (j)  The Group accounts for its share of post-
acquisition changes in net assets of associates 
and joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised 
profits and losses resulting from transactions 
between the Group and its associates and 
joint ventures.
 (k)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of profit/loss of 
consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified 
and adjusted against the income of the Group in 
order to arrive at the net income attributable to 
shareholders of the Company.
 (l)  Non-Controlling Interest’s share of net assets 
of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and 
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
B.3  Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies
 (a) Current and Non-Current Classification
   The Group presents assets and liabilities in 
the Balance Sheet based on Current/Non-
Current classification.
  An asset is treated as Current when it is –
  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
  All other assets are classified as Non-Current.
  A liability is treated as Current when –
  -  It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle;
  -  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period, or
  -  There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
   The Group classifies all other liabilities as 
Non-Current.
   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified 
as Non-Current Assets and Liabilities.
 (b) Business Combination
   Business Combinations are accounted for using 
the acquisition method of accounting, except 
for common control transactions which are 
accounted using the pooling of interest method 
that is accounted at carrying values.
   The cost of an acquisition is measured at the 
fair value of the assets transferred, equity 
instruments issued and liabilities assumed at 
their acquisition date i.e. the date on which 
control is acquired. Contingent consideration 
to be transferred is recognised at fair value 
and included as part of cost of acquisition. 
Transaction related costs are expensed in the 
period in which the costs are incurred.
   For each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets.
   Goodwill arising on business combination is 
initially measured at cost, being the excess of 
the aggregate of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for non-controlling 
interests, and any previous interest held, over 
the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
and measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses if any.
   Common control business combination: Business 
combinations involving entities or businesses that 
are controlled by the group are accounted using 
the pooling of interest method.
 (c) Property, Plant and Equipment
   Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at 
cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount 
and rebates less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the assets 
to its working condition for its intended use, 
net charges on foreign exchange contracts 
and adjustments arising from exchange rate 
variations attributable to the assets. In case of 
land the Group has availed fair value as deemed 
cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.
   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the entity and the cost can be 
measured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment 
which are significant to the total cost of that item 
of Property, Plant and Equipment and having 
different useful life are accounted separately. 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to 
project, net of income earned during the project 
development stage prior to its intended use, 
are considered as pre-operative expenses and 
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.

   The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment 
are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Gains or 
losses arising from derecognition of a Property, 
Plant and Equipment are measured as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
 (d) Leases
   The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-of-
use asset and a lease liability for its leasing 
arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset.
   The contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset, if it involves the 
use of an identified asset and the Group has 
substantially all of the economic benefits from 
use of the asset and has right to direct the use 
of the identified asset. The cost of the right-
of-use asset shall comprise of the amount of 
the initial measurement of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date plus any 
initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use 
assets is subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated depreciation/amortisation, 
accumulated impairment losses, if any and 
adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease 
liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated/
amortised using the straight-line method from 
the commencement date over the shorter of 
lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
   The Group measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can 
be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
   For short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
   The Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as 
an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are 
classified as finance lease whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
 (e) Other Intangible Assets
   Other Intangible Assets are stated at cost of 
acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade 
discount and rebates less accumulated 
amortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if 
any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing 
costs, and any cost directly attributable for 
preparing the asset for its intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate 
variations attributable to the Other Intangible 
Assets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, 
the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost 
on the date of transition to Ind AS.
   Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
item will flow to the entity and the cost can be 
measured reliably.
   Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
   Gains or losses arising from derecognition of 
an Other Intangible Asset are measured as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
   The Group’s Other Intangible Assets include 
assets with finite and indefinite useful life. 
Assets with finite useful life are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected useful life 
and assets with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortised but are tested for impairment annually 
at the cash generating unit level.
   A summary of the amortisation/depletion policies 
applied to the Group’s Other Intangible Assets to 
the extent of depreciable amount is as follows.
Particulars Depreciation
T echnical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 to 10 years.
Development 
Rights
W.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the 
unit of production method. The cost of 
producing wells along with its related 
facilities including decommissioning 
costs are depleted in proportion of oil 
and gas production achieved vis-à-vis 
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost 
for common facilities including its 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
using Proved Reserves. W.r.t. other 
development rights, amortised over the 
period of contract.
License Fee Amortised over the remainder of 
the License period from the date of 
commencement of the commercial 
operation.
Spectrum  
Fees
Amortised from the date of 
commencement of commercial 
operation over the balance validity 
period, based on the expected pattern 
of consumption of the expected future 
economic benefits, in accordance with 
the applicable Accounting Standards.
Others In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than the 
aggregate rebate availed by the Group.
   The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Other Intangible Assets with a finite 
useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.
 (f) Research and Development Expenditure
   Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss as and when incurred. Development 
costs are capitalised as an intangible asset if it 
can be demonstrated that the project is expected 
to generate future economic benefits, it is 
probable that those future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity and the costs of the asset 
can be measured reliably, else it is charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
 (g) Cash and Cash Equivalents
   Cash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash 
on hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and 
short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
 (h) Finance Costs
   Borrowing costs include exchange differences 
arising from foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the 
interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of 
the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is 
one that necessarily takes substantial period of 
time to get ready for its intended use. Interest 
income earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing 
costs eligible for capitalisation.
   All other borrowing costs are charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for 
the period for which they are incurred.
 (i) Inventories
   Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing 
for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-
products which are valued at net realisable value. 
Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, 
cost of conversion and other costs including 
manufacturing overheads net of recoverable 
taxes incurred in bringing them to their 
respective present location and condition. Cost of 
finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, 
chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, 
trading and other products are determined on 
weighted average basis.
 (j)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets — 
Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill 
and Other Intangible Assets
   The Group assesses at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that any Property, 
Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other 
Intangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash 
Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine 
the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not 
possible to estimate the recoverable amount 
of an individual asset, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the CGU to which the 
asset belongs.
   An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to 
the extent, asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of 
disposal and value in use. Value in use is based 
on the estimated future cash flows, discounted 
to their present value using pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and risk specific to the 
assets. The impairment loss recognised in prior 
Corporate Overview   Management Review   Governance   Financial Statements
Consolidated
NOTES  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
422 423
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
accounting period is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimate of recoverable amount.
 (k) Provisions
   Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost.
  Provision for Decommissioning Liability
   The Group records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of future expenditure using 
a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred 
to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the underlying 
assets. Any change in the present value of the 
expenditure, other than unwinding of discount 
on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to 
the provision and the corresponding asset. The 
change in the provision due to the unwinding 
of discount is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 (l) Contingent Liability
   Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
 (m) Employee Benefits Expense
  Short-Term Employee Benefits
   The undiscounted amount of short-term 
employee benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for the services rendered by employees 
are recognised as an expense during the period 
when the employees render the services.
  Post-Employment Benefits
  Defined Contribution Plans
   The Group recognises contribution payable 
to the provident fund scheme as an expense, 
when an employee renders the related service. 
If the contribution payable to the scheme for 
service received before the balance sheet date 
exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit 
payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. 
If the contribution already paid exceeds the 
contribution due for services received before the 
balance sheet date, then excess is recognised 
as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment 
will lead to, for example, a reduction in future 
payment or refund.
  Defined Benefit Plans
   The Group pays gratuity to the employees 
who have completed five years of service at 
the time of resignation/superannuation. The 
gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every 
completed year of service as per the Payment of 
Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount 
is contributed to the approved gratuity fund 
formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the 
employees. The gratuity fund has been approved 
by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability 
in respect of gratuity and other post-employment 
benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method and spread over the period during 
which the benefit is expected to be derived from 
employees’ services.
   Remeasurement gains and losses arising 
from adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are recognised in 
the period in which they occur, in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
  Employee Separation Costs
   The Group recognises the employee separation 
cost when the scheme is announced and the 
Group is demonstrably committed to it.
 (n) Tax Expenses
   The tax expenses for the period comprises of 
Current Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is 
recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised in the Other Comprehensive 
Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income.
  i. Current Tax
    Current tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that 
are enacted at the Balance sheet date.
  ii. Deferred Tax
    Deferred Tax is recognised on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised 
to the extent it is probable that taxable 
profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, and the 
carry forward of unused tax losses can be 
utilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets 
are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period in which 
the liability is settled or the asset realised, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period. The 
carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities 
and assets are reviewed at the end of each 
reporting period.
 (o) Share Based Payments
   Equity-settled share based payments to 
employees and others providing similar services 
are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. Details regarding 
the determination of the fair value of equity-
settled share based payments transactions are 
set out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share 
based payments is expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will 
eventually vest, with a corresponding increase 
in equity. At the end of each reporting period, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest. The 
impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative 
expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to the Share Based 
Payments Reserve. The dilutive effect of 
outstanding options is reflected as additional 
share dilution in the computation of diluted 
earnings per share.
 (p)  Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date 
of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the functional currency’s closing rates of 
exchange at the reporting date.
   Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except 
to the extent of exchange differences which are 
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on 
foreign currency borrowings that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or construction 
of qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of 
assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on 
foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 
1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or 
construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in 
the carrying cost of such assets.
   Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
recorded using the exchange rates at the date of 
the transaction. Non-monetary items measured 
at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising 
on translation of non-monetary items measured 
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition 
of the gain or loss on the change in fair value 
of the item (i.e. translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income or Statement 
of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit 
and Loss, respectively).
   In case of an asset, expense or income where a 
non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date 
of transaction is the date on which the advance 
was initially recognised. If there were multiple 
payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates 
of transactions are determined for each payment 
or receipt of advance consideration.
 (q) Revenue Recognition
   Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. The Group 
is generally the principal as it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer.
   Generally, control is transferred upon shipment 
of goods to the customer or when the goods 
is made available to the customer, provided 
transfer of title to the customer occurs and the 
Group has not retained any significant risks of 
ownership or future obligations with respect to 
the goods shipped.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
424 425
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
   Revenue from rendering of services is recognised 
over time by measuring the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations 
at the reporting period.
   Revenue is measured at the amount of 
consideration which the group expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to a customer as specified in 
the contract, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties (for example taxes and 
duties collected on behalf of the government).
   Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction 
of performance obligations and a receivable 
is recognised when it becomes unconditional. 
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
services as the case may be.
   The Group provides volume rebates to certain 
customers once the quantity of products 
purchased during the period exceeds a threshold 
specified and also accrues discounts to certain 
customers based on customary business 
practices which is derived on the basis of crude 
price volatility and various market demand – 
supply situations. Consideration is determined 
based on its most likely amount.
   Generally, sales of petroleum products contain 
provisional pricing features where revenue is 
initially recognised based on provisional price. 
Difference between final settlement price and 
provisional price is recognised subsequently.
   The Group does not adjust short-term advances 
received from the customer for the effects of 
significant financing component if it is expected 
at the contract inception that the promised good 
or service will be transferred to the customer 
within a period of one year.
  Contract Balances
  Trade Receivables
   A receivable represents the Group’s right to an 
amount of consideration that is unconditional.
  Contract Liabilities
   A contract liability is the obligation to transfer 
goods or services to a customer for which the 
Group has received consideration or is due from 
the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Group transfers goods or services to 
the customer, a contract liability is recognised 
when the payment is made or the payment is 
due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when the Group performs 
under the contract.
  Interest Income
   Interest Income from a financial asset is 
recognised using Effective Interest Rate Method.
  Dividend Income
   Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s 
right to receive the amount has been established.
 (r) Financial Instruments
  i.  Financial Assets
  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement
    All financial assets are initially recognised at 
fair value. Transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets, which are not at Fair Value 
Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the 
fair value on initial recognition. Purchase 
and sale of financial assets are recognised 
using trade date accounting. However, trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component are measured at 
transaction price.  
  B.  Subsequent Measurement
  a)  Financial assets measured at Amortised 
Cost (AC)
    A financial asset is measured at Amortised 
Cost if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is to hold the asset in 
order to collect contractual cash flows 
and the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise to cash flows on specified 
dates that represent solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
  b)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value 
Through Other Comprehensive Income 
(FVTOCI)
    A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI 
if it is held within a business model whose 
objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that represent solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
  c)  Financial Assets measured at Fair Value 
Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
    A financial asset which is not classified in 
any of the above categories are measured 
at FVTPL.
    Financial assets are reclassified subsequent 
to their recognition, if the Group changes 
its business model for managing those 
financial assets. Changes in business model 
are made and applied prospectively from 
the reclassification date following the 
changes in business model in accordance 
with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 
– Financial Instruments.
  C. Other Equity Investments
    All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss, except for those equity investments 
for which the Group has elected to present 
the value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive 
Income’.
    However, dividend on such equity 
investments is recognised in Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the Company’s right 
to receive payment is established.
  D. Impairment of Financial Assets
    In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group 
uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for 
evaluating impairment of financial assets 
other than those measured at Fair Value 
Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected 
Credit Losses are measured through a loss 
allowance at an amount equal to:
• The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or
• Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the life of the 
financial instrument).
    For trade receivables, the Group applies 
‘simplified approach’ which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. 
The Group uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking 
estimates are analysed.
    For other assets, the Group uses 12 month 
Expected Credit Loss to provide for 
impairment loss where there is no significant 
increase in credit risk. If there is significant 
increase in credit risk full lifetime Expected 
Credit Loss is used.
  ii.  Financial Liabilities
  A. Initial Recognition and Measurement
    All financial liabilities are recognised at fair 
value and in case of borrowings, net of 
directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring 
nature are directly recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
as finance cost.
  B.  Subsequent Measurement
    Financial Liabilities are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. For 
trade and other payables maturing within 
one year from the balance sheet date, the 
carrying amounts approximate fair value due 
to the short maturity of these instruments.
  iii.  Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting
    The Group uses various derivative financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps, forwards and options and 
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk 
of changes in interest rates, exchange rates 
and commodity prices. At the inception of 
a hedge relationship, the Group formally 
designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes 
to apply hedge accounting and the risk 
management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised 
at fair value on the date on which a 
derivative contract is entered into and 
are also subsequently measured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as financial 
assets when the fair value is positive and 
as financial liabilities when the fair value 
is negative.
    Any gains or losses arising from changes 
in the fair value of derivatives are taken 
directly to Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss, except for the effective portion 
of cash flow hedge which is recognised in 
Other Comprehensive Income and later to 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss 
or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged 
forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability.
    Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows:
  A. Cash Flow Hedge
    The Group designates derivative contracts 
or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities 
Corporate Overview   Management Review   Governance   Financial Statements
Consolidated
NOTES  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2023
426 427
Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
as hedging instruments to mitigate the 
risk of movement in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable future cash 
flows attributable to a recognised asset or 
liability or forecast cash transactions. When 
a derivative is designated as a cash flow 
hedging instrument, the effective portion 
of changes in the fair value of the derivative 
is recognised in the cash flow hedging 
reserve being part of Other Comprehensive 
Income. Any ineffective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the derivative is 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging 
relationship no longer meets the criteria for 
hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold/terminated 
or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in 
cash flow hedging reserve till the period 
the hedge was effective remains in cash 
flow hedging reserve until the underlying 
transaction occurs. The cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the cash 
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the underlying 
transaction. If the forecasted transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, then the 
amount accumulated in cash flow hedging 
reserve is reclassified in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
  B. Fair Value Hedge
    The Group designates derivative contracts 
or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities 
as hedging instruments to mitigate the 
risk of change in fair value of hedged item 
due to movement in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices.
    Changes in the fair value of hedging 
instruments and hedged items that 
are designated and qualify as fair value 
hedges are recorded in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging 
relationship no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the adjustment to 
the carrying amount of a hedged item for 
which the effective interest method is used 
is amortised to Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.
  iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments
    The Group derecognises a financial asset 
when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows from the financial asset expire or it 
transfers the financial asset and the transfer 
qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 
109 – Financial Instruments. A financial 
liability (or a part of a financial liability) is 
derecognised from the Group’s Balance 
Sheet when the obligation specified in 
the contract is discharged or cancelled 
or expires.
  v.  Offsetting
    Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the Balance Sheet when, and only when, 
the Group has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the amount and it intends, either to 
settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 (s) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale
   Non-Current Assets are classified as Held for 
Sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use and sale is considered 
highly probable. A sale is considered as highly 
probable when decision has been made to 
sell, assets are available for immediate sale in 
its present condition, assets are being actively 
marketed and sale has been agreed or is 
expected to be concluded within 12 months of 
the date of classification. Non-current assets held 
for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. 
Assets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale 
are measured at the lower of their carrying 
amount and fair value less cost of disposal and 
are presented separately in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.
 (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
   The Group has adopted Successful Efforts 
Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas 
activities. The policy of recognition of exploration 
and evaluation expenditure is considered in 
line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, 
geological and geophysical studies, petroleum 
exploration license fees and general and 
administration costs directly attributable to 
exploration and evaluation activities are expensed 
off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest 
in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and 
evaluation other than those which are expensed 
off are accounted for as Intangible Assets under 
Development. All development costs incurred in 
respect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised 
under Intangible Assets under Development. 
Once a well is ready to commence commercial 
production, the costs accumulated in Intangible 
Assets under Development are classified as 
Other Intangible Assets corresponding to proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration 
and evaluation expenditure which does not result 
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all 
cost pertaining to production are charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
   The Group uses technical estimation of reserves 
as per the Petroleum Resources Management 
System guidelines 2011 and standard geological 
and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve 
review and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil 
and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint 
Operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as 
well as income and expenditure are accounted 
on the basis of available information on a line-
by-line basis with similar items in the financial 
statements, according to the participating interest 
of the Group.
 (u) Earnings Per Share
   Basic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing 
the net profit after tax by the weighted average 
number of equity shares outstanding during the 
year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. 
Diluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures 
used in determination of basic earnings per share 
to take into account the conversion of all dilutive 
potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity 
shares are deemed converted as at the beginning 
of the period unless issued at a later date.
C.  Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
  The preparation of the Group’s financial statements 
requires management to make judgement, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and 
the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about 
these assumptions and estimates could result in 
outcomes that require a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in 
future periods.
(A)  Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
  The determination of the Group’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves requires significant judgements 
and estimates to be applied and these are regularly 
reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability 
of geological and engineering data, reservoir 
performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, 
drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact 
on the determination of the Group’s estimates of its oil 
and natural gas reserves. The Group bases it’s proved 
reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry practice 
and regulatory requirements.
  Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used 
to calculate depletion charges for the Group’s 
oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in 
estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively 
by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. Oil and 
natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the 
assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying 
values reported in the financial statements. Details on 
proved reserves and production both on product and 
geographical basis are provided in Note 35.
(B) Decommissioning Liabilities
  The liability for decommissioning costs are recognised 
when the Group has an obligation to perform site 
restoration activity. The recognition and measurement 
of decommissioning provisions involves the use of 
estimates and assumptions. These include the timing 
of abandonment of well and related facilities which 
would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, 
expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope 
of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied 
for discounting.
(C)  Property Plant and Equipment/Other 
Intangible Assets
  Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by the management. Property, 
Plant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets are 
depreciated/ amortised over their estimated useful 
life, after taking into account estimated residual value. 
Spectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity 
period, based on the expected pattern of consumption 
of the expected future economic benefits.
  Management reviews the estimated useful life and 
residual values of the assets annually in order to 
determine the amount of depreciation/amortisation 
to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful 
life and residual values are based on the Group’s 
historical experience with similar assets and take into 
account anticipated technological and future risks. 
The depreciation/ amortisation for future periods 
is revised if there are significant changes from 
previous estimates.
(D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables
  Judgements are required in assessing the 
recoverability of overdue trade receivables and 
determining whether a provision against those 
receivables is required. Factors considered include 
the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount 
and timing of anticipated future payments and any 
possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk 
of non-payment.

Reliance Industries Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23
(E) Provisions
  The timing of recognition and quantification of 
the liability requires the application of judgement 
to existing facts and circumstances, which can be 
subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions 
and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to 
take account of changing facts and circumstances.
(F)  Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible 
Assets with indefinite useful life
  Management reviews the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful life 
annually, to determine whether there has been any 
impairment by allocating the value of goodwill and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful life to a Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has identified  
CGUs’ for this purpose, considering the nature of the 
businesses to which each of the CGU relates. 
  Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU is 
aggregate of cash flow projections, for five years as 
approved by Senior Management and beyond five 
years extrapolated using a long-term growth rate 
which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash flow projections 
are discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which 
ranges from 8% to 12%.
  The Management believes that any reasonably 
possible change in the above key assumptions 
on which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the 
aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.
(G)  Impairment of Financial and 
Non-Financial Assets
  The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are 
based on assumptions about risk of default and 
expected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement 
in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs 
to the impairment calculation, based on Group’s past 
history, existing market conditions as well as forward-
looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
  In case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates 
asset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an 
asset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use.
  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account, if no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used.
  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
have been allocated to the respective CGUs which are 
determined at the entity level. During the year ended 
March 31, 2023, the Group has determined that there 
is no impairment towards these assets.
(H)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and 
Liabilities
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
temporary differences and unused tax losses for 
which there is probability of utilisation against the 
future taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to 
determine the amount of deferred tax that can be 
recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level 
of future taxable profits and business developments.
(I) Fair Value Measurement
  For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer Note 38 of financial statements.
(J) Revenue
  The application of Accounting Standard on 
Revenue Recognition for digital segment involves 
complexity and use of key judgements with respect 
to multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue 
recognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. 
The Management has reviewed such accounting 
treatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in 
terms of the relevant Ind AS.
(K) Leases
  The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to 
be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. 
The Group uses judgement in assessing whether a 
contract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease 
term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable 
discount rate, variable lease payments whether 
are in-substance fixed. The judgement involves 
assessment of whether the asset included in the 
contract is a fully or partly identified asset based on 
the facts and circumstances, whether the contract 
include a lease and non-lease component and if so, 
separation thereof for the purpose of recognition and 
measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter 
alia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether 
the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use 
of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the 
lease payments are fixed are variable or a combination 
of both.
D. Standards Issued but not Effective

The estimates of Rate of Escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information 
is certified by the actuary.
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the 
composition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for 
Plan Assets Management.
  VIII)  The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2022-23.
  IX)  These plan’s typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk 
and Salary Risk.
Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset 
by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate 
of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life 
expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

 35.3  The Government of India (GOI), by its letters dated 2nd May, 2012, 14th November, 2013, 10th July, 2014 and 3rd June 2016 
has disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3 entitles the 
Company to recover. The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the 
terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined 
in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI 
of $ 165 million (C 1,353 crore) being the Company`s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,029 crore) towards additional 
Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023. 
The next date of hearing is awaited.
   In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI notified 
the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26 th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to 
instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under 
the guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be 
credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool 
Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in 
respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been 
challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.
 35.4  (a)  GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ 
1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on behalf 
of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The 
Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an appeal on 15 th 
November, 2018 before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award 
of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration 
Award dated 24th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI’s appeal.
  (b)  Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI on 16th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts (‘PSCs’) for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks 
due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by 
majority issued a final partial award (‘2016 FPA’), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12th October, 
2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 
16th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral 
Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 (‘2018 
FPA’). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English 
Commercial Court rejected GOI’s challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants’ challenge in February 2020 and 
remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable 
award on 29th January, 2021 (“EPOD Agreements Case Award”). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements 
Case Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9 th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application 
before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral 
Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which 
will take place post determination of Claimants’ request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs. 
    GOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and 
execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The 
Claimants contend that GOI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government’s Execution Petition 
before the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon'ble Court ruled that Government of India’s execution petition seeking 
enforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal’s Final Partial Award dated 12 th October, 2016 (“2016 FPA”) 
relating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.
  (c)  NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a 
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses 
in the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.
   Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible 
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations. 
Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

 (III)  On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to 
the Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum 
Limited, then a subsidiary of RIL. Hearings were held before the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) of SEBI in respect of the 
SCN. By an order dated March 24, 2017 , the WTM passed the directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from dealing in equity 
derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the 
date of the order; and (ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from 
November 29, 2007 till the date of payment. In May 2017 , RIL and the other noticees filed an appeal before the Securities 
Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) against this order. SAT, by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020 
and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and other 
noticees has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17 , 2020, the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of 
the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order 
dated December 17 , 2020 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. In the very same matter, on November 21, 2017 , SEBI 
issued show cause notice, inter alia, to RIL, asking RIL to show cause as to why inquiry should not be held in terms of SEBI 
(Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 and penalty not be imposed 
under the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. The Adjudicating Officer of SEBI passed an 
order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL. RIL has paid the penalty under protest and has filed an 
appeal before the SAT against this order.
 (IV)  Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of 
Telecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to C 3,748 crore which includes penalty 
and interest thereon (Previous Year C 3,620 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations 
to DOT contesting the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good 
grounds on merit to defend itself in the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in 
respect of the aforesaid matter.
37. Capital Management

objectives are as follows:
 a)  Maintain investment grade ratings for all issuing entities, domestically and internationally by ensuring that the financial 
strength of their Balance Sheets are preserved.

   The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value 
measurements as described below:
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
   Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly or indirectly; and
  Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
  Valuation Methodology
  All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
  a)  The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of 
Deposits and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
  b)  The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves.
  c)  The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward 
exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
  d)  The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
  e)  Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, 
brokers and price index developers.
  f)  The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants 
assumptions and other data that are available.
  g)  The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
  h)  All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.
 B. Financial Risk Management
   The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within 
the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the 
volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance. 
  i) Market Risk
    Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as 
equity price risk and commodity risk.
   a) Foreign Currency Risk
     Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.
     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial 
instruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

  ii) Commodity Price Risk
    Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The 
Group has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity 
prices and freight costs.
    The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control 
processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives 
and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange T raded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and 
freight exposure.
  iii) Credit Risk
    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due 
causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and 
receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to 
customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance 
function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.
    The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group 
Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group 
restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
  iv) Liquidity Risk
    Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local 
financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure 
efficient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. T reasury monitors rolling forecasts of the 
Group’s cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including 
contingencies.
    The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. 
T reasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net 
deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank 
deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to 
avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.

 C. Hedge Accounting
   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and 
other feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group 
has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved 
hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange 
traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve 
this objective. 
   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative 
method and critical term matching method.
  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. 
  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:
