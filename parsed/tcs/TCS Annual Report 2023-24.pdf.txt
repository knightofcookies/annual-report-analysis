Across industries globally, there are multiple mega trends 
that are shaping priorities of businesses: AI, New Energy, 
Supply Chain and Talent. These transitions will require 
substantial investment in technology across industry 
sectors. Your company is making significant investments 
and building capabilities to partner with customers 
during this phase of rapid technological shifts.

Letter from the
Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
In FY 2024, your company has continued to deliver strong 
performance. I am pleased to share with you that your company 
has crossed annual revenues of ₹240,893 crore, a growth of 
6.8%, over the previous year . With relentless focus on operational 
excellence, this growth has come at an industry leading operating 
margin of 24.6%*, an increase from 24.1% last year . The order 
book for FY 2024 came at an all-time high of US$ 42.7 billion 
supported by strong client relationships and engagement. Client 
metrics continue to exhibit healthy progress with strong client 
additions. Employee retention continues to be at benchmark 
levels in the industry. TCS has been selected as a Top Employer of 
Choice in 32 countries. TCS has retained its ranking as the second 
most valuable global IT services brand, valued at US$19.2 billion, 
an increase of US$2 billion from last year .
The global environment around the world continues to go 
through significant shifts. Post the pandemic, which resulted in 
supply chain shocks, there was an economic slowdown especially 
in developed markets. While initial signs of stability began to 
emerge, the military conflicts have further intensified this year 
and continue to impact the global supply chains. 
After two years of recessionary fears, persistently high 
inflation, and unprecedented monetary tightening, the global 
macro-outlook looks relatively better now with improving 
growth, disinflation, and monetary easing in sight.
Across industries globally, there are multiple mega trends that 
are shaping priorities of businesses: AI, New Energy, Supply 
Chain and Talent. 
• GenAI technologies will impact almost every sector and 
country going forward. Enterprises have already invested 
in cloud, data infrastructure and large processing power 
which will aid AI/ GenAI. GenAI will not only improve 
productivity, but also create impact we hitherto have not 
seen or imagined. 
• Global energy transition is accelerating, and businesses 
are making clear commitments towards a sustainable 
future. The energy requirement of our fast-changing world 
is enormous. Key is to lower the cost of energy while also 
transitioning to renewables. This transition requires large 
investment in technology, electric mobility, renewable 
power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
• Geo-political challenges are continuing to alter established 
supply chains and companies are rebalancing their supply 
chains to address both resilience and efficiency. New global 
supply chain ecosystems are being created, with India 
playing an important role in advanced manufacturing.
• Advanced manufacturing, new technologies like AI, new 
energy, data and business models are changing the future 
of work and are compelling new skillsets to be built for the 
future. 
• Secure networks have become a key necessity as data is the 
foundation for businesses of today. These networks power 
everything from predictive analytics and AI to personalized 
customer experiences. As value of data increases, along 
with concerns of privacy and protection, it has rightly 
become a focal point of security for all businesses. 
The key question is what these disruptions mean to the IT 
services industry and how your company is preparing for these?
As enterprises globally prepare to respond to these mega 
trends, we see multiple opportunities for your company. Every 
industry is embracing these trends and their business is being 
shaped for the future. For example:
• The deployment of AI and GenAI will significantly help 
financial institutions in both driving efficiency as well 
as target new customers and serve customers in a very 
personalized manner . For example, Insurance claims 
will be processed in a matter of minutes, lending and 
disbursements will become much faster .
• Adoption of new energy solutions and AI technology is 
driving the future of automobiles. It is not only driving 
reduction of emissions but also providing a new level of 
customer experience. 
• AI is accelerating drug development by screening millions 
of compounds, predicting interactions and generating new 
candidates for testing.
• Connected medical devices together with AI and GenAI will 
transform Healthcare in a significant way. It will enhance 
productivity, enable remote care and help overcome 
shortage of skilled resources.
• In Advanced manufacturing, an AI-first approach will 
drive new benchmarks in productivity, efficiency and 
sustainability. 
• Telecom industry globally is upgrading communication 
infrastructure to 5G/6G. These high speed, low latency 
networks, along with edge compute and AI will 
become the backbone of businesses in future.
These transitions will require substantial investment in 
technology across industry sectors. Your company is making 
significant investments and building capabilities to partner with 
customers during this phase of rapid technological shifts:
• In FY 2024, TCS has consolidated AI and Cloud expertise 
with the creation of the AI.Cloud unit. In addition, each 
of the business groups are developing domain-specific 
AI/GenAI offerings relevant to the industry value chain. 
Over 300,000 employees have been upskilled on GenAI 
technologies in FY 2024. TCS’ products and services are 
also being enhanced with AI capabilities. For example, TCS 
BaNCSTM is enriching its product portfolio with integrated 
AI/ML and GenAI capabilities; AI is also being embedded in 
Cybersecurity services to enable predictive capabilities.
• To partner with customers on their energy transition 
agenda, TCS is investing in research on green hydrogen, 
biofuels; developing digital platforms to help customers 
reduce Scope 1/2/3 emissions. Our proprietary ESG 
framework enables enterprises to build transparency into 
operations and simplifies compliance reporting.
• TCS is pioneering the engineering of the 5G/6G 
communication stacks using open standards. Two 
state-of-the-art labs for future ready communication 
infrastructure and interoperability have been setup at 
Bengaluru and Gurugram. Investments are being made in 
multiple niche technologies such as 5G SA Core, O-RAN 
radios, to build these solutions indigenously.
• Your company continues to invest in upskilling its talent 
base of over  600,000 employees. Employees are actively 
leveraging experiential and personalized learning on a wide 
range of emerging technologies, clocking over 51 million 
learning hours in FY 2024. TCS continues to build strong 
talent supply chains with deep partnerships with leading 
educational institutions, shaping the curriculum for new 
skill needs for the future.
On behalf of the Board of Directors of the company, I want to 
thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.
Warm regards,
N Chandrasekaran
Chairman
Letter from the CEO1
It is my privilege to be writing to you from this desk as we near 
20 years to our listing since August 25, 2004. Over the last two 
decades, your company’s Revenue and Net Profits have grown 
at a compounded annual growth rate of over 18% each.
It has been almost a full year since my transition as CEO, 
and I am happy to report that it has been a very stable and 
seamless experience for all our stakeholders. During this 
period, we refocused on our industry and technology expertise, 
emphasized and refreshed the core values that define who we 
are as a company, and doubled down on customer centricity 
and employee empathy.
We had a strong finish to the fiscal year FY 2024, with revenue 
for the year at ₹240,893 crore. This is, a growth of 6.8% over 
the previous year (3.4% in constant currency). Demand for 
our services showed remarkable resilience as macroeconomic 
uncertainties and geopolitical volatilities continued in major 
markets through the year .
This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of 
24.6%2. More importantly we exited the year with a quarterly 
operating margin of 26% in Q4, demonstrating our commitment 
to the margin band of 26% to 28%. Our Net Margin was at 
19.3%2.
Dear Stakeholder,
The Earnings Per Share was at ₹127.742, a growth of 10.9% over 
the prior year .
Among the Business Segments, Manufacturing grew 10.6%, Life 
Sciences and Healthcare grew 8.7%, Banking, Financial Services 
and Insurance grew 5.6%, Consumer Business grew 4.9%, 
Communication, Media and Technology grew 4.6%, while Others 
grew 14.5% (YoY in reported currency).
Among geographies, growth was led by emerging markets: Latin 
America grew 21.1%, India grew 20.3%, Middle East & Africa 
grew 14.8% while Asia Pacific grew 4.0%. The UK grew 17.7%, 
Continental Europe grew 6.5%. North America grew 2.3% (YoY in 
reported currency).
We are seeing strong deal momentum across markets resulting 
in double-digit growth in our TCV of US$ 42.7 billion, which 
reflects our deepening partnership with our clients and gives us 
optimism for the medium to long term growth outlook.
In keeping with our capital allocation policy of returning 
substantial free cashflow to shareholders, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of ₹28 per share, bringing the 
total dividend for the year to ₹73 per share. The company also 
successfully completed its fifth buyback program, distributing 
₹17,000 crore to shareholders. For the full year, the company’s 
shareholder payout was ₹47,445 crore, which will be our largest 
payout to date. Our average shareholder payout has been more 
than 100% during the last 5 years.

The rise of GenAI has been catching 
customers’ attention, and it promises 
a leap in productivity and accelerates 
the creation of new products and 
services. Although still in the early 
stages of adoption, the use of GenAI is 
expected to transform every industry.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Business Overview
Established in 1968, our company has been a pioneer in the 
IT industry, across various technology cycles. At each of these 
defining moments, we refocused our investments, reinvented 
ourselves, and helped clients transform their businesses to stay 
ahead of the technology curve.
During FY 2024, customers continued reprioritization of 
projects in favor of those which are considered business-
critical and where ROI realization is likely faster . We continue 
to see pressure on customers’ discretionary spending. The 
recently won deals are converting into revenue as planned, 
the ongoing engagements started during the pandemic are 
being re-examined for the incremental value generated. While 
transformation remains a key ask, customers are expecting the 
same to be funded through savings from operations. Hence, the 
key engagement themes we saw during the year were  around 
cost optimization and cloud transformation.
Demand was led by vendor consolidation, cloud migration 
and transformation, customer and employee experience 
enhancement, operating model transformation, business 
process optimization, supply chain initiatives, sustainability, AI
enablement i.e. creating a cloud and data foundation for AI, and 
early-stage AI-infused transformational engagements.
Today, clients are seeing cloud as a strategy for business 
transformation and growth. The shift to cloud-native products 
and platforms is being fast-tracked, to achieve increased 
collaboration, security, scalability and efficiency. Hybrid,
multi-cloud platforms are now becoming mainstream. Cloud 
adoption is a catalyst for innovation, and a strategy for 
business and growth itself. It provides the unifying digital fabric 
that forms the foundation for a connected future—one
that continues to unfold with each technological advancement, 
including generative AI (GenAI).
The rise of GenAI has been catching customers’ attention, and 
it promises a leap in productivity and accelerates the creation 
of new products and services. Although still in the early stages 
of adoption, the use of GenAI is expected to transform every 
industry. Many of our clients who are early adopters have begun 
experimentation and exploration on various use cases of GenAI, 
with our help.
The Innovation Edge
Exploring innovative uses of GenAI continues to be a  key 
focus area. We are helping our customers to use AI to: 
(i) Assist, leveraging AI to supplement tacit knowledge with 
contextual knowledge to boost work effectiveness (ii) Augment, 
accelerating elite performance through collaborative 
intelligence, where humans and machines complement and 
magnify each other’s talents, and (iii) Transform, leaping to a 
knowledge-driven superstructure with fast, consistent, and 
high-quality decision output to deliver new ways of working and 
the full realization of enterprise-wide AI. We have created one 
of the largest AI / ML and GenAI talent pools in the industry. We 
have doubled down on partnerships in areas such as AI, cloud, 
quantum computing and cybersecurity. These early investments 
have given TCS a head start in being a partner in our customers’ 
technology adoption journey.
With our contextual knowledge and domain expertise, 
engineering DNA and intellectual capital, we have been the 
preferred partner for many customers in their strategic
initiatives. This year, we signed several deals that are 
industry- defining in nature. We have included narratives about 
the work we did for BSNL – building an indigenous network, a 
true nation building project and how we built an advanced post 
trading platform for SIX in this Integrated Annual Report.
Our continued investments in Research and Innovation, and in 
building intellectual property, have further strengthened our 
transformational credentials. Many of our earlier R&I programs 
have matured into successful platforms and solutions which 
performed very well this year and helped differentiate our 
growth. We leveraged TCS HOBSTM to transform Celcom Axiata 
Berhad’s core business support systems. For PostNord, TCS 
TwinXTM is helping increase sorter capacity, remove bottlenecks, 
and improve the collection and distribution sort plan. Similarly, 
TCS OmnistoreTM is helping European home improvement 
company Kingfisher orchestrate a faster, smoother, and seamless 
checkout experience.
Building a Skilled Workforce
Our approach to talent is strategic — we consider our employees 
as key stakeholders in our growth. Our ability to cycle through 
different technology and business model changes, continuously 
embrace new knowledge and stay relevant, defines us and gives 
us a significant edge over our competitors.
We have a strength of 601,546 employees, and our LTM attrition 
in IT services was 12.5%, down by 760 bps over the previous 
year . Our workforce continued to be very diverse, with over 152 
nationalities represented and with women making up 35.6% of 
the employee base.
We launched several initiatives this year to 
inculcate a strong engineering culture among 
our employees and build deeper skills in 
market relevant technologies like Cloud, AI, 
Cyber Security and more. TCS is collaborating 
with all the hyperscalers and entering new 
partnerships with other important players in 
the AI ecosystem to upskill at scale and build 
AI computing infrastructure to develop AI 
solutions for our customers.

Best regards,
K Krithivasan
Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
We launched several initiatives this year to inculcate a 
strong engineering culture among our employees and build 
deeper skills in market relevant technologies like Cloud, AI, 
Cyber Security and more. TCS is collaborating with all the
hyperscalers and entering new partnerships with other
important players in the AI ecosystem to upskill at scale and 
build AI computing infrastructure to develop AI solutions for our 
customers.
In FY 2024, TCSers logged 51 million learning hours, and 
acquired nearly 5 million competencies. A culture of lifelong 
learning and innovation, by closely linking learning with careers 
and rewards, has placed us as the Global Top Employer for the 
9th consecutive year, across 32 countries — placing us as one in 
only 16 organizations worldwide to achieve this status.
Embracing Aalingana
We have fully adopted  Project Aalingana, the Tata group’s 
sustainability roadmap and the aim is to be net zero by
2045, integrating sustainability into business strategy and 
concentrating on three interlinked pillars of the project, i.e., 
promoting the decarbonization of our company and value 
chains; utilizing a systematic, circular economy approach
to reduce resource usage and waste; and protecting and 
regenerating the environment.
We continue to make good progress in our net zero journey, 
on the environmental front. TCS had set a target to reduce its 
absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and
become net zero by 2030. We are well ahead of our initial Scope 
1 and 2 targets and have achieved a reduction of 80% in Scope 
1 and 2 emissions in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016. We are 
doing this by increasing use of renewable sources of energy and 
improving energy efficiency.
The company’s strategy for reducing emissions includes addition 
of more green buildings to the company’s real estate portfolio, 
reduction of IT system power usage, responsible sourcing, and 
the use of TCS Clever EnergyTM, which leverages IoT, machine 
learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across 
campuses.
TCS is not only improving its own sustainability but also helping 
clients develop and implement their sustainability strategies 
and improve outcomes. We have built a comprehensive suite of 
over 200 offerings in sustainability services and solutions across 
different industry verticals. These solutions help enterprises 
decarbonize their operations and create net-zero pathways, 
addressing biodiversity loss and growing inequity. We help 
customers embed circularity in their products and services, by 
helping design agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chains and 
promoting reuse, recapture, and recycling.
Passion for Our Purpose
TCS is meaningfully connecting marginalized groups, including 
women and youth, to economic opportunities. We continue 
to work with communities across the world, pursuing our 
long-standing commitment to programs in the areas of 
education, literacy for livelihood, skilling for employment, and 
digital entrepreneurship; while exploring areas of healthcare, 
digital inclusion, water, climate and sustainability.
Through clearly defined focus areas and strategic programs, our 
work has impacted the lives of over 7.1 million people. We are 
working with public and social sector organizations to help close 
the literacy gap among the most marginalized adults, helping 
them access government entitlements and improving access to 
livelihood. We are empowering students in government schools 
with 21st century skills, introducing them to careers of the 
future, while empowering and building capacity of the teachers 
and education system.
By working with other private sector organizations, we are 
helping marginalized youth transition from college to meaningful 
careers across a variety of sectors. Our digital entrepreneurs are 
connecting disadvantaged communities in rural and aspirational 
districts across India with front line services in social welfare, 
banking, finance, insurance, health, e-commerce, logistics and 
more.
Our employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of 
Purpose by Employees) resulted in over 6.7 million hours 
dedicated to purpose projects across dimensions of biodiversity, 
mental health, climate action, circularity, literacy, education, 
skilling, mentoring, conservation and more covering the 17 UN 
Sustainable Development Goals.
Greater Governance
Governance at TCS encompasses ensuring ethical and 
transparent business conduct, addressing sustainability risks and 
opportunities and aligning robust disclosure requirements under 
the aegis of the board. At TCS, the Tata Code of Conduct serves 
as a guide for all employee behavior .
TCS consciously embeds the highest standards of governance 
in its operations. We have a holistic compliance framework and 
an integrated governance structure that encourages a strong 
commitment to global Environment, Social and Governance 
(ESG) disclosure standards for promoting transparency and 
accountability. As part of the Tata Group, we have long
recognized the ESG stewardship as core to our purpose. We have 
a proud legacy of pioneering positive change, not just within the 
industry but in the communities where we operate as well, and 
our commitment remains steadfast.
Looking Ahead
Our all-time high order book, continued deal flow and pipeline 
velocity give us confidence in our business momentum. Looking 
forward, we see greater opportunities ahead, as businesses 
become more technology-intensive and depend on technology 
to drive competitive differentiation and transform their 
industries. Our integrated business model which drives value 
creation for all our stakeholders, will continue to help us benefit 
from each new wave of technology change, and be a force 
multiplier for our growth and leadership in years to come. We 
thank you for your continued support in our journey ahead.

With 13,500 trade legs per minute, 13 million transactions per 
day and few trillion USD worth of securities in custody, SECOM 
is the electronic post trading system used by SIX for automated 
processing and settlement of transactions. Built by TCS, SECOM 
was one of the world’s first real-time gross settlement (RTGS) 
systems and formed the backbone of the Swiss capital market. 
But can a three-decade old system meet the strenuous demands 
of modern times? TCS and SIX both knew the answer was ‘no’. 
SIX decided to embark on a journey of transformation yet again, 
backed by three decades of relation and trust it shares with TCS. 
Back in 1990, when SIX was looking to enhance the scalability 
of its batch system to meet the market demands of the future, 
TCS proposed a new platform called SECOM. This platform 
would be real time, cutting-edge, scalable, and modular with 
robust architecture. Enabling straight-through processing, it was 
amongst the most sophisticated systems of its time. Over the 
years, TCS continued to manage this system for SIX.
Three decades later, SIX partnered with TCS to accomplish 
another mega feat. TCS executed a PoC to demonstrate the

from mainframe to an open and more resilient system began. 
This is going to give a second life to our core

With a commitment to empower all individuals to access 
financial services equitably, Experian PLC, a global leader in 
consumer and business credit reporting services, has taken a 
significant step towards bridging the gap in financial inclusion for 
differently abled people in the UK. 
As the Dublin, Ireland headquartered company helped 
differently abled people take control of their credit with 
complete access to their data and offers, it discovered that 
this demographic is mostly under-served. Organizations across 
utilities, retail and banking are not aware or not able to cater 
to their support needs effectively, providing the company an 
opportunity to get closer to its customer and deliver more 
accessible products and services. 
Shaping a future of accessibility and financial inclusion   
With TCS as a partner, Experian developed the Support Hub 
to help vulnerable people get easier access to essential 
services like banking, utilities, telecom and retail. For the 
first time, consumers can disclose their support needs to 
multiple organizations at the same time and have complete 
control over their data with an intuitive and accessible UX 
designed exclusively for them.  
Leveraging the TCS PaceTM and TCS Accessibility Centre 
of Excellence from design to testing,  Support Hub is 
instrumental in improving Experian’s user engagement. 
The Experian Support Hub allows people to share their 
support needs with multiple service providers in a simple, 
standardized way. For instance, the end customer can now 
define their needs like requesting statements in Braille or 
getting longer appointments or more support when visiting 
a branch.  
Through this unique initiative, Experian has been able to 
expand its partner ecosystem which will help them enter 
new markets and make a pivotal advancement in fostering 
financial inclusion. By 2030, Experian aims to help seven 
million consumers connect with over 200 organizations. 
TCS has been a critical partner of Experian in this initiative from 
day 1, working closely with the Support Hub team to structure 
our requirements and design an intuitive, accessible solution 
that could be deployed quickly. We’re proud of Support Hub and 
its impact in supporting vulnerable consumers, and it’s been a 
pleasure to have TCS join us on this journey.

Connecting India, Faster: BSNL 
4G/5G Network roll-out 
Post the satisfactory evaluation of the indigenous telecom 
stack, BSNL awarded TCS the mandate to supply, install and 
commission the pan India 4G/5G mobile network across 
100,000 sites. The contract involves the following key 
dimensions:
• Establishing modern cloud native data centers with 
geographical redundancies for each of the four zones 
and about 30+ edge data centers closer to the clients.
In response to the Government of India’s ‘Atmanirbhar 
Bharat’ call, TCS collaborated with Centre for Development 
of Telematics (C-DOT) and Tejas Networks Limited (Tejas) to 
design and develop an indigenous telecom stack. This complex 
initiative was undertaken with significant efforts to design the 
equipment, establish a lab and testing infrastructure of scale 
besides building the entire manufacturing ecosystem in India. 
The resultant solution of EPC Core, RAN, IMS, and the cognitive 
NMS was proven by integrating it in the state-owned Bharat 
Sanchar Nigam Limited’s (BSNL) existing network through a 
well-structured proof of concept. The indigenously designed 
equipment are programmable and the overall network will be 
‘Software Defined’ and highly configurable. With this, India 
became only the fifth country in the world to have developed 
this complex technology end to end.
• Deploying the EPC Core and IMS software supplied by 
C-DOT integrating it with the existing BSNL landscape 
in a high scalable cloud architecture along with TCS’ 
Cognitive Network Operations (CNOPS) to efficiently 
manage and configure the network.
• Install, commission, and optimize the Radios (RAN) 
meeting the specifications of BSNL and global 
standards, supplied by Tejas.
• Extend Operations and Maintenance support to the 
network on an on-going basis.
This project is governed as a ‘mission-mode’ project by TCS, 
BSNL and the Department of Telecommunications. As of 
April 2024, TCS has delivered 11,000 sites and are well on its 
way to complete the roll-out by end of this year . BSNL has 
already added to the scope another 22,000 sites to further 
densify the coverage and to include ‘saturation’ sites. This 
is to ensure digital inclusivity to rural and remote areas of 
India.
This is a historic and significant leap towards bridging the 
digital divide, ushering in the benefits of a powerful voice 
and data network to all corners of the country. With this, 
TCS along with its partners is enabling BSNL to enhance 
its competitiveness, increase revenues, offer a compelling 
enterprise proposition, and explore new business 
opportunities.

What happens when two companies with a shared vision join 
forces? We have a greenfield insurance firm that is digital-first, 
always available and provides gold standard customer 
experience to its members. 
Irish bank, AIB and Great West Life Co entered a joint venture 
to transform the life, pensions, and investment market in 
Ireland. They also wanted to address the 35% gender gap in 
pensions. TCS was selected as a strategic partner for the newly 
launched AIB life in Ireland, including greenfield operations set 
up in Letterkenny. TCS helped create a modern, cloud-based 
technology stack from the ground up with its unique 
insurance-in-a-box solution. 
In Ireland, insurance offerings mainly follow a tiring process 
where the sales process can take weeks. TCS and AIB life 
re-imagined the entire journey, with a digital first ambition and 
customers at the heart of everything.  
A joint venture gives rise to a digitally powered insurance firm  
The entire system was built on a public cloud. The scalable, 
resilient, and future-ready system was up and running within 15 
months and AIB life had exceeded 5,000 new policy sales by the 
end of 2023.  
A dedicated, cloud-enabled contact center and back-office 
in Ireland supports AIB life’s operations – allowing their 
distributor to advise customers on 12 different product 
offerings. Further differentiated products are envisaged to 
enable AIB life to respond to market changes.  
TCS continues to support the firm in its mission of creating 
truly omnichannel experience, while handling 100+ policy 
activations on an average day, with self-service capabilities 
and straight through processing. 
After an 
extensive review of the 
market, it was clear that TCS’ contextual 
industry knowledge, European cloud-based technology 
and global delivery team based in Letterkenny was a great fit for 
us.  As we build and scale what is a new greenfield life company, it is key 
that we start on a foundation of cutting-edge technology, and from the outset, 
establish a digital business with a partner that shares our vision, with the capacity 
and experience to back our ambition to build our new company at pace, while being 
committed to delivering the very best for our customers. In addition, TCS’ investment in Ireland 
through their Global Delivery Centre in Letterkenny, from where we are servicing AIB life customers, enables 
us to deliver customer service excellence as we support the financial wellbeing of our customers, their 
families, and their businesses. Being able to do that from within Ireland was particularly important.

The warranty claims received by a global manufacturer of 
engines and power system products, for its service network 
included a mix of structured data, narratives/ notes. The notes 
were used by experts to determine the validity and the warrant-
able items in a manually adjudicated claim process. In auto 
adjudicated claims, there were certain anomalous claims that 
got cleared for payment if met the criteria of a standard claim.
TCS conceptualized and implemented an Intelligent adjudication 
and anomaly detection solution that automated the review of 
all claims using Machine Learning for structured data, Natural 
Language Processing for unstructured data and a scenario-based 
modelling approach for anomalies, in combination with business 
rules to provide informed inference to adjudicators or adjust 
claims wherever apparent before further adjudication.
TCS solution provides a scalable model for all types of claims 
including traceability needed for decision support, and could 
automate 91% of claims’ approval, resulting in efficient 
utilization of adjudicator’s time and improved realization time 
for the service providers. The solution delivered an increase 
in productivity hours, an annual savings of over US$5 million 
in terms of warranty costs and identification of anomalous

Travel better with a Next GenAI Solution
A leading North American airline customer wanted to drive 
operational efficiency throughout the airport operations control 
domain by enabling key stakeholders with operations information 
in real time. In addition, their objective was also to improve 
customer experience through next GenAI technologies.
For all US airlines, 116 million are the delayed minutes every 
year . With an average of 100 passengers on each flight, this 
results in 11.6 billion minutes of passenger delays and frustration. 
Travel better during delays was the core around which the airline 
customer and TCS embarked on a GenAI journey to help their 
end customers reach their destination by seamlessly capturing 
contextual data along with their preferences. TCS’ solution 
provided a conversational experience to deliver contextualized 
personalized message while apologizing for the flight delay, 
leveraging GenAI to ask about preferences including final location, 
drive time, earliest arrival, or least waiting time along with an 
end-to-end integration to provide options and rebooking for a 
seamless passenger experience.

TCS customer is a leading Global Insurance and Asset Management 
Provider . The customer’s contact center agents need to respond to 
user queries related to travel insurance policies’ terms & conditions 
across various states it is presently servicing. Agents had to search 
through many T&C, resulting in high wait time for the customer.
TCS designed a GenAI led solution to generate quick yet consistent 
and contextual responses for end users. The state-wise T&C and 
insurance plans were extracted and semantically chunked to 
provide context to GenAI models based on user query. Prompt 
templates were created to extract contextual information needed 
for agents to generate responses to the end user query. Guardrails 
have been implemented using responsible AI principles. Agents can 
review, validate, and fine tune responses as needed.
The solution can help reduce the average handling time by 40% 
and thereby result in an overall improvement in 
customer satisfaction.
TCS customer is a leading electricity generating and gas retailing 
company in ANZ, whose strategy is to develop new power 
generation infra and improve existing assets to drive long-term 
growth while meeting sustainability. Currently, significant fuels 
used to generate electricity are natural gas and coal and three 
gas turbines are being used to meet peak load of grid. One of 
the gas turbine compressor casing had developed crack and 
functionally failed which resulted in shut down. The customer 
wanted to avoid these unwanted shutdowns by predicting the 
survival probability for combustor casings.
TCS’ IP2TM, an intelligent power plant solution that uses AI, 
IoT, and digital twin technologies was deployed to extract 
operational life experience profile from timeseries sensors’ 
information of the gas turbine process including more than 
seven years of historical data. The solution summarizes the data 
and predicts and validates crack length based on the same for 
other gas turbines.
TCS solution has helped in ensuring that the gas turbines 
operate efficiently and in preventing costly unplanned 
maintenance and helps in reducing plant O&M costs while 
reducing carbon emissions.

 During the year
, several initiatives were aligned to achieve 
the carbon targets which included those in building and IT 
infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included 
higher energy efficiencies in heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC) systems, uninterruptible power supply 
(UPS), green buildings and energy monitoring & analytics 
(Clever Energy & Resource Optimisation Centre) which have 
resulted in energy savings of 16,301 MWh, equivalent to 
11,671 tCO2e reduction during FY 2024.  
 Initiativ
es in green IT focussed on data centre and IT device 
consolidation and optimization to reduce the carbon 
footprint. The Company reduced power consumption 
in one of the data centres by 80kW through server 
consolidation and optimization. As a concomitant interim 
outcome, the weighted average PUE increased marginally 
from 1.66 in FY 2023 to 1.7 during FY 2024. In FY 2025, TCS 
plans to optimize and consolidate the UPS infrastructure, 
towards reducing the non-IT load, thereby achieving the 
PUE target of 1.65. In addition to this, TCS will continue to 
ensure energy efficiency of the equipment procured. 
 TCS
’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System 
(TCS Clever EnergyTM) which involves real time energy 
monitoring continues to yield benefits in terms of 
optimization of operational energy efficiency across all 
offices. 
 The roof t
op solar photo voltaic installations this year 
remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3 percent of 
total electricity use in the reporting year . A rooftop solar 
photovoltaic (PV) of 260 KWp has been planned for 
implementation in FY 2025. The Compan
y increased the 
renewable energy procurement through switch over to 
green tariffs for its operations in several states in India, in 
addition to open access power purchase agreements (PPA) 
for renewable energy in some cases. Renewable energy

procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable 
energy use to 74 percent of total energy use during the 
year .
 TCS is certified t
o ISO 50001:2018 standards for Energy 
Management Systems (EnMS) across 22 campuses in India. 
Out of these, 2 campuses were added under certification 
in FY 2024, continuing our commitment to energy 
conservation and management.
 The abov
e energy efficiency and renewable energy 
procurement efforts helped achieve a year-on-year 
reduction in absolute carbon footprint (across Scope 1 
and Scope 2) of TCS’ global operations by 31 percent.  
The c
ompany has achieved 80% reduction in absolute 
emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) when compared to the 
base year of FY 2016. The electricity consumption across 
TCS operations increased by 14.6% in the current year 
compared to FY 2023. This is due to increased scale of 
operations considering increase in number of associates

 Resear
ch & Development (R&D): Specific areas in which 
R&D was carried out by the Company
 TCS R
esearch and Innovation delivered significant value 
to TCS’ customers, the research community and society at 
large through numerous initiatives and impactful outcomes.
 Inv
enting for Impact:
 TCS R
esearch continued to expand its foundational research 
in computing and its intersection with the sciences with an 
emphasis on AI, especially Large Language Models (LLM).
 The explor
ation of innovative uses of GenAI has been a 
focal point for TCS Research this year . TCS delved deep 
into three key areas: (i) Generative design for scientific 
and engineering applications, (ii) Transformation of 
knowledge work, encompassing but not restricted to 
software development and operations management, and 
(iii) Reimagination of the user engagement paradigm across 
diverse domains.
 TCS e
xplored use of GenAI to identify new molecules or 
modifications of existing molecules that show promise of 
being useful as new drugs (of medicinal value), as well as to 
evaluate them for ease of synthesis and manufacturing. TCS 
used GenAI to design alloys and materials while at the same 
time using generative exploration of the chemistry and the 
process route. The Company leveraged LLMs through the 
lens of domain models to curate ontology (information 
model) as well as failure/performance knowledge for large 
manufacturing operations reducing the time needed for 
such activities from months to days. The Munch Museum in 
Oslo is exploring the use of GenAI with TCS to create a  
co-drawing system for museum visitors. The use of GenAI in 
all domains of human activity is exploding and TCS Research 
is at the forefront of several such explorations.
 The Company
’s research on enterprise digital twins 
witnessed accelerated growth due to a growing interest 
and adoption of this technology across industries from 
communications to airlines and retail. TCS’ strategy of 
investing in robotics translated to a business initiative and 
gained traction with customers leading to collaborative 
partnerships with major robotics accelerators such as 
the National Robotarium, UK and MassRobotics, US. The 
software research teams continued with their focus on  
self-healing and adaptive model-driven software 
architecture, adapting to changes and uncertainties 
seamlessly. 
 TCS c
ontinues to explore and invest in foundation research 
encompassing topics like computing for finance, building 
digital twins for the human heart and brain, quantum 
computing and nano sensing for future IoT and healthcare 
applications, meta-material based reconfigurable intelligent 
surfaces for next-generation wireless systems like 6G, 
neuromorphic computing for low-power edge-AI,  
post-quantum cryptography, and other emerging as well as 
futuristic technologies.
 TCS c
ontinues to contribute to standards in areas such as 
environmental engineering, cyber security, cyber resilience, 
Internet of Things, smart cities, software architecture, 
quantum computing and communication, accessibility of 
ICT for the differently abled, AI, Metaverse, Agile Devops, 
e-Learning and FinTech-RegTech.

Overview of the Industry
The journey over the past few years has been eventful, starting 
with supply-chain disruptions in the aftermath of the pandemic, 
the Russia-Ukraine war that triggered a global energy and 
food crisis, and a considerable surge in inflation, followed by a 
globally synchronized monetary policy tightening. The global 
GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2023, lower than 
3.5% in CY 20221, led by fears of a hard recession. Yet, despite 
many gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the 
banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging 
market economies did not suffer sudden stops. Economic 
growth has been stronger than expected in the second half of 
2023 in the United States, and several major emerging market 
and developing economies. However, the rising momentum was 
not felt everywhere, with notably subdued growth in the euro 
area, reflecting weak consumer sentiment, the lingering effects 
of high energy prices, and weakness in interest-rate-sensitive 
sectors.
Unmet revenue expectations have ushered in a new wave of 
pragmatism where maintaining a healthy profit margin has 
become pivotal for corporations due to the uncertain macro-
outlook. In extreme cases, organizations resorted to cost-cutting 
measures, such as reducing headcount and cutting discretionary 
spending, including IT services. Organizations taking a more 
rational approach are simply shifting the emphasis of ongoing 
IT projects toward cost control, efficiencies and automation 
while curtailing IT initiatives with longer RoIs. Global technology 
spending on Enterprise software and IT services was close to the 
US$2.3 trillion2 mark in CY 2023, with IT services growing at 6.1% 
YoY to US$1.4 trillion. 
The global IT services industry continues to be a highly 
fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a 
mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT 
services providers globally, with a market share of 2.1%. TCS’ 
outperformance is significantly higher over the last decade. 
The outperformance may be attributed to market share gains 
resulting from TCS’ strategy on customer centricity, its agile 
organization structure, and a very stable leadership team; 
its investments in organic talent development, research and 
innovation, intellectual property, brand building, and in building 
newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet share with 
clients; and better execution resulting in greater customer 
satisfaction.

Strategy for Sustainable Growth3
TCS has successfully navigated through multiple technology 
cycles since its inception, transforming and adapting each time 
to build relevant new capabilities and helping its clients realize 
the benefits of that innovative technology. TCS’ responsiveness, 
agility and adaptability to change have been core to its longevity.
Customer-centricity is at the heart of TCS’ strategy, organization 
structure and investment decisions. TCS has been broadening 
and deepening customer relationships by continually looking 
for new opportunities and newer areas in their businesses to 
add value, proactively investing in building capabilities, reskilling 
its workforce, and launching innovative services, solutions, 
products, and platforms to address those opportunities. 
TCS is reinventing itself at a time of unprecedented change in 
the IT Services industry. Digital, AI and Cloud technologies are 
now business enablers, and core to the success of business, 
fueling the need for enterprise-wide transformation and 
continuous innovation. 
Technology disruption is blurring traditional industry lines, 
making cross-industry expertise an imperative. Adaptation is 
the key to survival. TCS believes in the power of inspiration 
and invention to build greater futures and help in transforming 
industries. The company’s research and innovation team apply 
scientific rigor and a collaborative mindset to solve pressing 
problems faced by industries and society. 
Over time, this strategy has resulted in deep and enduring 
customer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, 
industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of the 
addressable market, and a proven record of accomplishment in 
delivering longer term stakeholder value. 
Enabling Investments
TCS has been at the forefront of every technology adoption cycle 
over the past several decades. The company has anticipated 
every technology change and invested in innovation, talent, 
intellectual property, and partnerships well in advance. TCS 
pioneered4 the ‘Default is Digital’ approach to leverage the 
new family of technologies that emerged in the last decade. 
TCS was early to identify that decision making in enterprises 
would increase in complexity and would require novel uses of 
digital technologies. Its research into Enterprise Digital Twins 
enables it to simulate enterprises in hi-fidelity and use AI for 
decision making. Backed by 10 years of research (started in 
2013) and over 40 publications in top-tier journals, TCS launched 
an Enterprise Digital Twin product offering called TCS TwinX™. 
The multiple award-winning product today simulates enterprise 
decision making for several TCS customers.
Quick to recognize the potential of cloud, the company made 
investments ahead of time in launching new platform-based 
business models as far back as in 20095, reskilling the workforce, 
research and innovation, building collaborative workspaces 
and innovation centers, intellectual property, and alliances and 
partnerships. TCS created a separate research group focused on 
‘Deep Learning and AI’ in 2017 and identified ‘AI’ as a critical skill 
that every researcher should acquire. TCS has doubled down 
on partnerships in areas such as AI, Quantum Computing and 
Cybersecurity. These early investments have given TCS a head- 
start in being a partner in its customers’ technology adoption 
lifecycles. 
The exploration of innovative uses of GenAI has been a 
focal point for TCS Research this year . More details on TCS 
R&I investments during the year are available on Page 61 of 
Directors’ Report in the section on ‘Technology absorption, 
adoption and innovation’. 
TCS’ dedication to innovation is evident with its dynamic 
intellectual property (IP) portfolio, which saw continual 
enhancement through the filing and granting of patents and the 
publication of research papers. TCS’ IP portfolio has grown by a 
CAGR of over 13% over the past decade. TCS is the largest patent 
filer in the industry category in India and has been honored with 
42 IP awards in the last 10 years, including winning the National 
IP Award 4 times in the last 7 years. 
TCS’ dedicated practice units around major hyperscalers have 
been steadily investing in training, certifications, credentials 
and in building solutions and intellectual property on their 
respective hyperscaler stacks. AI.Cloud Academy was launched 
to bring together initiatives from all Cloud and AI partners, and  
to drive talent transformation at scale with a theme “Making AI 
REAL” for TCS’ customers. As on 31st March 2024, TCS had one 
of the world’s largest AI/ML and GenAI trained workforce. AI 
Experience Zone, TCS’s indigenous, multi-platform AI playground 
continues to develop employees with higher competencies 
in GenAI through Industry specific use cases integrated into 
programs and hackathons. One of the significant investments 
has been in building a multi modal, hyperscaler agnostic, domain 
catalogue enabled, pattern driven, multi orchestrator GenAI 
platform called TCS AI WisdomNext to help customers accelerate 
their GenAI journey.
In addition to the hyperscalers, TCS has also invested in building 
key partnerships with other major cloud and AI ecosystem 
partners, to bring best of GenAI offerings to TCS’ customers. TCS 
has invested in deep dive technical training along with hands-on 
sessions to help upskill existing employees thereby empowering

them to leverage technology as part of ongoing delivery. TCS has launched AI Academy and the AI Experience Zone platform for 
experiential AI/ML and GenAI talent development.  TCS has launched several PoVs on how the industry value chains including personas 
involved can be transformed using the power of GenAI.  TCS also has significantly invested in onboarding 150+ horizontal and vertical 
solutions on hyperscaler platforms in a cloud native manner augmented with GenAI capabilities.  
As TCS transforms industries, building momentum requires continuous perseverance, flawless execution against the company’s 
strategic priorities: Customer Centricity and Employee Empathy.

• PULSE: Pulse 2023 r ecorded an enthusiastic participation 
with more than 82% of employees taking the survey. TCS 
has achieved a Satisfaction Index of 79.0 and Engagement 
Index of 80.0.
Purposeful People Policies
Key policies introduced in FY 2024 include:
• Policy on Fle
xible Work Arrangements extended the scope 
of the existing policy to provide necessary support and 
flexibility to all employees (inclusive of fathers/non-birthing 
parents) who are primary caregivers of young children, post 
childbirth or adoption of a child. 
• Considering TCS has a c
onsiderable workforce below 40 
years of age, TCS encouraged employees to prioritize 
their health and fitness, and revised its TCS India Policy – 
Preventive Health Screening, to extend the scope of the 
existing policy to employees under the age of 40 years.
Employee Retention
TCS’ values-driven culture, progressive HR policies, and 
philosophy of investing in people and empowering them have 
been integral in creating a culture of belonging.   The company’s 
philosophy of grooming leadership from within and giving the 
first right of refusal to internal talent for new open positions, 
inspires higher levels of loyalty to the organization. This has 
resulted in a very strong, deeply acculturated mid-layer with 
long tenures in the company. They have played a pivotal role in 
integrating new talent and have added significant value through 
their contributions and contextual knowledge.
The company’s employee friendly policies and processes, 
collaborative and inclusive work environment, investment in 
learning platforms and providing vibrant learning and career 
growth opportunities have helped it remain a benchmark in 
talent retention. IT services’ attrition trended down throughout 
the year and was 12.5% for FY 2024. At TCS, three months’ 
notice is required from either side for termination6. 
Return to Office
TCS is built on deep engagement with its diverse and distributed 
workforce, instilling in them a sense of purpose as well as a 
sense of belonging and pride. Return to Office (RTO) is a key 
priority to better integrate new joiners and stay deeply engaged 
with all its people, thereby fostering ‘TCS Culture’ and the ‘TCS 
Way’. This is vital for employees to “experience” the workplace 
ecosystem. RTO has been the key priority to better integrate 
new joiners and stay deeply engaged with all its employees. 
TCS has approximately 55% of its employees working from the 
office on all working days of the week.
Culture and Diversity
TCS is an equal opportunity employer and has a well-defined and 
progressive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policy embracing 
all diversity parameters which includes gender, marital status, 
religion, race/caste, colour, age, ancestry, nationality, language, 
ethnic origin, socio-economic status, physical appearance, 
disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression 
and any other category protected by applicable law.
TCS recognizes that a diverse and inclusive workforce is 
necessary to drive innovation, foster creativity, and guide 
business strategies. Other highlights include:
• iExcel
: TCS’ flagship executive leadership development 
program for women completed 24 editions, benefiting over 
1,700 women leaders.
• Client eng
agement: Allies of Diversity is a program where 
senior leadership from client organizations are invited to

ee Resource Groups: Platforms for under-
represented communities and their allies to share 
concerns, experiences, stories and strategic solutions. TCS 
has 13 voluntary, employee-led groups that have come 
together based on shared diversity identity characteristics 
or interest. 
• Champions of Equity: This c
ampaign was created to ensure 
a fair and inclusive culture in the workplace. A Champion of 
Equity is someone who treats everyone with fairness and 
transparency and holds a strength-based approach towards 
every individual, culture, and system. 
• Supplier Diver
sity: TCS has a Supplier Diversity Program 
that identifies certified diverse suppliers that can provide 
competitive, high-quality goods and services whose business 
model is aligned with the company’s business strategy. 
Occupational Health and Safety
TCS has a well-defined Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
policy and supporting processes to ensure the safety and 
well-being of its employees. Safety lead and lag indicators 
are measured across the organization and reported. The 
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee in the Board reviews the 
company’s health and safety performance half-yearly. 89.6% of 
the workforce is represented in joint management-employee 
health and safety committees that monitor, advise, and drive 
occupational, health and safety initiatives. 
TCS is certified to ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System standard across 129 of its facilities 
worldwide covering 84.9% of delivery centers corresponding 
to 89.6% of people footprint operating from these locations. 
General safety awareness (fire safety, office safety, road safety 
etc.) and safety incident reporting awareness was provided to 
employees through monthly themes and campaign initiatives. 
The company continued to focus on creating ergonomic 
awareness including correct postures and workstation stretches 
for an office-based work environment through the ergonomic 
campaigns and periodic webinars. There were also several 
fitness programs, including yoga and meditation practices, 
mental health and wellbeing which drew employee participation.

Analysis of revenue growth and margin performance
On a reported basis, TCS’ revenue grew 6.8% in FY 2024, compared to 17.6% in the prior year . The company’s performance showed 
a remarkable resilience against the backdrop of macro uncertainty and geo-political volatility. Demand for TCS’ services, particularly 
around cloud adoption, cost optimization, vendor consolidation and operating model transformation, resulted in record deal wins. The 
newly won deals conversion into revenue continued as expected, but the revenue inflows kept getting neutralized by reduction in the 
existing revenue base as some of the earlier projects got completed, optimized, or in some cases, downsized. This led to overall muted 
revenue growth in FY 2024. 
EBIT margins were 24.6%* in FY 2024, compared to 24.1% in the previous year . Margin improvement was led by improved productivity, 
better utilization and reduction in subcontractor expenses.

Business Outlook
Global growth estimated at 3.2 percent in 2023 is projected to 
continue at the same pace in 2024 and 20258. With disinflation 
and steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing seems to 
have receded, and risks to global growth seem broadly balanced. 
The uncertainty seen through last year is expected to persist 
for the next few quarters. Capex investments are projected to 
remain subdued as enterprises focus on maximizing returns 
from existing investments, resulting in muted spending on 
infrastructure, software, and services. Cessation of hostilities 
and successful control of inflation can be the triggers for 
recovery which will stimulate global demand. This, in turn, 
should prompt customers to resume spending on discretionary 
products and services.
Despite challenges, spending on IT services has been resilient so far . 
Cloud technologies have become the mainstay of an enterprise’s 
agenda and key to achieving sustainable growth. As a unifying 
digital hub that brings multiple other technologies to life, cloud has 
accelerated digital and business transformation over the last fiscal. 
The higher level of uncertainty in the business environment has 
made clients more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and 
business operating model transformations that can not only deliver 
significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile and 
resilient. All this has resulted in a record order book for FY 2024, at 
US$42.7 billion. Global IT Spending is expected to increase 8% in 
20249, with enterprises emphasizing on organizational efficiency 
and optimization. 
Last year saw GenAI seemingly at the heart of every strategic 
discussion. Fueled by cloud, this combination of AI capabilities 
is creating new possibilities and new opportunities. Firms will 
continue to invest heavily in technology to enhance efficiency, 
security, and customer experience. Rise in spend is expected in 
cloud computing, ecosystem play and GenAI leading to better 
resilience and new customer value creation. Cybersecurity 
will remain a top priority, driving demand for advanced threat 
detection and prevention solutions. 
All the above factors provide growth visibility over the medium 
to long term amid near-term uncertainty. If the delayed 
decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments 
through FY 2024 continues into the next fiscal year, it could lead 
to a moderation in growth in FY 2025.
Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in 
FY 2025 include:
• Technology tr
ansformation:  IT infrastructure 
modernization, cloud enablement, application and data 
estate modernization, cloud migration and transformation; 
data centre and collocated data support; SaaS adoption; 
digital workplace; digital twins; cyber security; ERP 
modernization; low-code no-code; 5G/Edge and AI 
adoption. 
• Business Tr
ansformation: Customer experience 
transformation using personalization, omnichannel 
implementation, immersive experiences using XR/
Metaverse; product and business model innovation; supply 
chain modernization; M&A integration / divestitures; 
sustainability, new business model enablement, by 
harnessing GenAI.
• Opera
tions: Plain vanilla outsourcing, vendor consolidation 
and multi-services deals; AI/ML-led transformation of IT 
/ business operations for greater resilience and leaner 
operating models; managed services models and real time 
operation visibility.

Enterprise Risk Management
TCS understands the importance of effectively managing and 
mitigating risks to protect the company’s business, its clients, 
to add value for all its stakeholders, and ensuring that the 
company’s reputation is intact.
The company follows a comprehensive enterprise risk 
management framework (based on best practices from COSO 
2017 and ISO 31000:2018) that encompasses risk identification, 
risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk 
monitoring and overall risk governance. Fostering a risk aware 
culture and empowering leaders to take intelligent risks to 
maximize value are crucial. TCS regularly conducts risk reviews, 
assessments, and scenario planning to anticipate potential 
challenges and develop mitigation plans. Key risk indicators 
and control indicators are used to assess risks, provide early 
warnings, and consider effectiveness of the mitigation actions, 
respectively. Furthermore, the company engages with all 
stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, 
partners and regulatory authorities, to ensure transparent and 
collaborative risk management practices.
TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering 
strategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic 
risks, thus enabling informed decision-making.  Risks are 
assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and 
bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units, 
geographies, business functions, customer relationships and 
individual projects.
By proactively managing and mitigating these risks, the 
company’s aim is to ensure the long-term sustainability and 
success of the company. TCS is confident that its robust 
risk management initiatives, coupled with its commitment 
to innovation and excellence, will enable the company to 
navigate the challenges of the IT industry and capitalize on the 
opportunities that lie ahead.
Listed below are some of the key risks and opportunities, 
anticipated impact on the company and mitigation strategies.

Volatile global 
political and 
economic 
environment (R)
Impact On: Human Capital, Financial 
Capital
• Geo-politics an
d macroeconomic 
volatility can affect demand for the 
company’s services. The Russia-Ukraine 
war and the Israel-Hamas conflict in the 
last 2 years has continued to lead to 
supply chain disruptions, energy crises, 
food and merchandise scarcities and 
impact on inflation. 
• Per
sistent high inflation in major 
economies could affect consumer 
confidence. The current high interest 
rate environment could result in 
economic slowdowns, affecting not 
only spending, but also squeezing 
liquidity.
• All of these could a
ffect clients’ 
business outlook and result in 
reduced demand for TCS’ services. It 
could also increase TCS’ costs of doing 
business. 
• In addition, there c
ould be risks to 
service delivery, business continuity, 
cybersecurity, sanctions compliance 
and human rights risks in geo-
politically sensitive zones, all of which 
could increase costs or affect the 
company’s revenue growth.

Impact On:  Natural Capital, Financial 
Capital, Social Capital
Risk:
• Extr
eme weather events due to 
climate change pose a threat 
to human safety and can cause 
disruptions especially in customer 
expectations, business operations and

• With globally distribut
ed operations, 
the company faces physical risks to life 
and property due to extreme weather 
events; transition risks resulting 
from disruptions in the market and 
emerging regulations; disruptions 
to operations due to water scarcity; 
risks of inadvertent non-compliance 
to emerging regulatory requirements 
around circular economy, e-waste 
and solid waste regulations, 
impacting health and safety in local 
communities, business disruption and 
reputational damage.  All of these 
could affect TCS’ growth, profitability 
and reputation.
• Deliver y centers are designed to withstand 
extreme weather events. Business continuity 
plans are tested periodically to ensure 
effectiveness. 
• Green buildings, e
fficient operations, green 
IT, greater use of renewable energy to 
reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer 
technologies and methods to manage waste 
in line with circular economy principles.

Opportunity:
• As ent
erprises look to reduce their 
own carbon footprint and cater 
to the growing demand more 
environmentally friendly products 
and services, it opens new business 
opportunities for TCS to provide 
technology-led solutions to help them

Internal Financial Control Systems and their Adequacy
TCS has aligned its systems of internal financial control in 
line with globally accepted risk-based framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the 
Treadway Commission.  This framework of internal financial 
controls meets the requirement of the Companies Act 2013. The 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) 
is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an 
organization’s process of designing and implementing a system 
of internal control. The framework requires a company to 
identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. 
The company has successfully laid down the framework and 
ensured its effectiveness. 
TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the 
nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide 
reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing 
reliable financial and operational information, complying with 
applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, 
executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring 
compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined 
delegation of power with authority limits commensurate 
with the responsibilities for approving engagements with all 
stakeholders that commits organizational resources and results 
in creation of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure. 
TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data 
for accounting, consolidation and management information 
purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes 
and controls with global best practices.
TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation 
17 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015) as of March 31, 2024. 
B S R & Co. LLP , the statutory auditors of TCS, have audited the 
financial statements included in this annual report and have 
issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control 
over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies 
Act 2013).
TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP to 
oversee and carry out an internal audit of its activities. Design 
and operating effectiveness of process controls on financial 
transactions is also audited by an independent in-house internal 
audit team.  The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which 
is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors 
and approved by the audit committee. In line with international 
practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the 
review of internal controls and risks in the company’s operations 
such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, 
employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including 
the subsidiaries and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party 
consultants and professionals for business specific compliances 
such as quality management, service management, information 
security, etc. The audit committee reviews reports submitted 
by the management and audit reports submitted by internal 
auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement 
are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective 
action. The audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors 
to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal 
control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its 
major observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies 
Act 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015), 
TCS’ audit committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, 
the company’s internal financial controls were adequate and 
operating effectively.

I. Company ’s Philosophy on Corporate Governance
  Eff
ective corporate governance practices constitute 
the strong foundation on which successful commercial 
enterprises are built to last. The Company’s philosophy on 
corporate governance oversees business strategies and 
ensures fiscal accountability, ethical corporate behaviour 
and fairness to all stakeholders comprising employees, 
investors, customers, regulators, suppliers and the 
society at large. Strong leadership and effective corporate 
governance practices have been the Company’s hallmark 
inherited from the Tata culture and ethos.
  The Company f
ollows the Tata Group philosophy of building 
sustainable businesses that are rooted in the community 
and demonstrate care for the environment. Being a 
part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability, 
the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and 
transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the 
Tata Code of Conduct (“
TCoC”).
  The Company has adop
ted the TCoC for its employees 
including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director 
and the Executive Directors. In addition, the Company has 
adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-executive directors 
which includes Code of Conduct for Independent Directors 
that suitably incorporates the duties of independent 
directors as laid down in the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act
”).
  The Company
’s corporate governance philosophy has been 
further strengthened through the Tata Business Excellence 
Model, the TCS Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider 
Trading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices 
(“Insider Trading Code”). The Company has in place an 
Information Security Policy that ensures proper utilization 
of IT resources.
  The Company is in c
ompliance with the requirements 
stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule 
V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2) 
of Regulation 46 of Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”), as 
applicable, with regard to corporate governance.
  The det
ails of TCS’ board structure and the various 
committees that constitute the governance structure1 of 
the organization are covered in detail in this report.
  The various ma
terial aspects of corporate governance and 
TCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below:

Material Topic TCS’ Approach
Board effectiveness, 
independence and protection 
of minority Shareholders’ 
interests
Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to 
serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively 
serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability 
and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available 
at https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/leadership.
For greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee2 has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise 
and:

• Gender: Tw o (22.2 percent) of the nine Directors are women.
•  Nati
onality: Four nationalities represented – Indian, American, Danish and British.
•  Indus
try: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation and Academia.
TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at https://on.tcs.
com/appointment-BoD. 
Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent 
directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the Independent Directors is related to each other, 
or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.
Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds 
directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as 
an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.
TCS’ governance philosophy around minority Shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC 
which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse 
and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.
TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures 
and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and 
material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured 
global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the 
management or the Board.
Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office 
through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ 
Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.
Avoidance of conflict of 
interest3
Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the 
Chief Ex
ecutive Officer and Managing Director (“CEO & MD”).
TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses 
covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee, 
including the executive directors, from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without 
remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. For the 
executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.
Values, Ethics and compliance6 Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has 
earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. 
The Company’s core values are: Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Pioneering and Unity.
The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate 
citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, 
prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and 
avoidance of conflicts of interest.
Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based 
annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, 
frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the Company values 
and the TCoC.
Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through 
inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.
Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical 
behaviour . They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, 
which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other 
stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by 
senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower 
Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to 
employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

Material Topic TCS’ Approach
Compliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance 
procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely 
monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.
Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer 
and the Chief Human Resources Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and 
Executive Director (“COO & ED”), and CEO & MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit 
Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery 
and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations. 
Tax Strategy7 TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting 
to the respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely 
manner .
TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose 
of gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where 
available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the 
tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a 
robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing 
the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, 
by itself or b
y its employees or vendors.
TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities 
worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the 
proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.
Board Oversight of 
Sustainability Matters8
TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by 
creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers 
and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics 
material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:
Material Sustainability Topics Board Committee
Financial reporting, robustness of internal controls and risk 
management systems, auditor remuneration, compliance to 
policies around insider trading, whistle blower, ethics and TCoC.
Audit Committee
Risk management policy and plan, management of foreign 
exchange risks, cyber security risks, data privacy risks and 
intellectual property infringement risks.
Risk Management 
Committee
Recommend composition of Board and its committees, 
appointment/re-appointment of directors and Key Managerial 
Personnel (“KMP”), design executive directors’ remuneration, 
recommend remuneration policy for directors, executive 
team and KMP , evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
Committees and Directors.
Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee
Health and safety at the workplace, shareholder grievances and 
other sustainability initiatives.
Stakeholders’ 
Relationship Committee
Community initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility, 
including compliances.
Corporate Social 
Responsibility Commttee
Succession planning TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and a 
decentralized organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across all 
business units have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust 
succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top 
two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, 
heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units.
Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit 
heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an 
opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

Material Topic TCS’ Approach
Building sustainable and 
responsible supply chain
TCS requires its suppliers to sign the TCoC upon empanelment. That includes principles on 
protecting and safeguarding human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while 
safeguarding their rights, the abolition of forced and compulsory labor, child labor in the 
supply chain and strong corporate governance practices including anti-corruption and bribery 
and promoting fair business practices across the supply chain. TCoC also requires its suppliers 
to protect the environment and make conscious use of scarce natural resources in their 
business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of health and safety in its 
workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices in letter and 
spirit in turn for its employees.
The Company supports the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It works with its suppliers to ensure that they 
too are fully aligned with these principles.

non-literate population comprises women, and from 
marginalized communities. TCS’ Literacy as a Service (LaaS) 
program addresses non-literacy among adults and creates 
awareness of key citizen entitlements. It serves the dual 
purpose of improving the literacy rate in the country and 
promoting social inclusion and ﬁnancial stability for 
marginalized communities. LaaS’ innovative teaching 
method leverages technology, the theory of cognition, and 
the laws of perception. The program’s creative means of 
delivery uses animated graphic patterns for easy visual and 
auditory learning.

This past year TCS has made signiﬁcant progress in its 
mission, empowering over 7 million people through its 
CSR programs including big bets aimed at people with 
highest need, in communities where resources are low, 
while using its core strengths to make a meaningful impact. 
This resulted in upward socio-economic mobility for 
797,749 people, building equitable and inclusive pathways 
for 405,775 women, 455,692 youth and 547,311 from 
marginalized groups.
This was achieved by scaling TCS’ high impact programs 
across India and 43 countries around the world, against 
four strategic themes (and eight focus areas): provide a 
21st century education for all (Education and Research, 
Literacy to Livelihood), help citizens equitably access good 
jobs of tomorrow (Employment through Skilling, Digital 
Entrepreneurship), enable delivery of world class front-line 
services in poorest districts (Healthcare, Digital Inclusion), 
and accelerate the just transition to a green economy 
(Water, Climate and Sustainability). No one organization 
can do this alone, and TCS through its purpose ecosystem 
engaged the key stakeholders to support the needs of the 
local communities.
TCS served 20,342 marginalized people through its 
Literacy as a Service program, empowering them through 
functional, ﬁnancial, and digital literacy. Gaining 
self-conﬁdence, dignity, and access to key citizen 
entitlements, they traversed a path from a vicious cycle of 
poverty, bonded labor, and harsh work conditions to 
charting their own course of savings and livelihood.
The onus of building Responsible AI rests not with today’s 
companies, workforce, and policy makers, but more so lies 
in the hands of the next generation of innovators. 
Empowering 6,209 teachers to inculcate computational 
thinking, Ignite my Future program of TCS prepared 
312,966 students across ﬁve continents with foundational 
skills for the age of AI, while the goIT digital innovation 
program inspired 118,016 students across 42 countries 
apply 21st Century Skills and latest technologies like AI, IoT, 
and App Design to solve real-world problems in their 
community. The most gratifying aspect is 53% of these 
students are girls and 76% from underrepresented 
minorities.
Gaining access to quality jobs in today’s digital economy can 
often be a challenge, even for those educated from leading 
institutions. TCS imparted marketable skills, credentials, and 
valuable certiﬁcations to 23,297 rural youth from 24 states 
and union territories across India, coaching and mentoring 
them for industry readiness through its Youth Employment 
Program. Nearly half of these are women, improving their 
income opportunities and participation in economic growth.
Across 1,735 villages in rural India, digital entrepreneurs 
from the TCS program ‘BridgeIT’, are earning their livelihood 
while providing much needed last-mile services to 312,175 
beneﬁciaries such as access to citizen entitlements, 
banking, ﬁnancial services, insurance, telehealth, telelaw, 
logistics, ecommerce and more. Expanding the program to 
44 districts, a new cohort of 1,400 women entrepreneurs 
from socially marginalized background are gearing up to be 
catalysts to strengthen the rural economy.
In a transformational year for community service, HOPE 
(Hours of Purpose by Employees), a TCS program saw 
volunteers contribute over 6.7 million hours to support 
the poor with basic necessities, to create better health 
outcomes for those who need help, to preserve and protect 
the environment, to empower better education, 
employment, entrepreneurship, and livelihoods for the 
marginalized. TCSers also built capacity and capability for 
over 50 social sector organizations through skills-based 
volunteering, providing in-kind digital, advisory and 
technology consulting services.
TCS jointly served needy communities around the world 
through 138 purpose partnerships, working alongside other 
Tata Group companies, its customers, and like-minded 
organizations through its Business with Purpose program. 
TCS harnessed the wisdom of over 1,800 cross-sector 
leaders through 11 Digital Empowers thought leadership 
forums, using their collective wisdom to help advance 
advocacy and policy eﬀorts globally.

The high unemployment rate among the youth, particularly 
from marginalized communities is a signiﬁcant issue in 
modern India. Their employment prospects and their ability 
to participate in the digital economy are impacted by 
challenges such as limited opportunities, deﬁcient 
communication skills, and a lack of technical expertise.
TCS’ Youth Employment Program (YEP) empowers the 
youth with its “Teach, Coach, Mentor and Place” model. 
Industry leaders and subject matter experts collaborate to 
deliver comprehensive training on business 
communication, aptitude, computer programming, and 
domain-speciﬁc skills.
The program facilitates a seamless transition between the 
academic and professional worlds and elevates the 
beneﬁciaries’ social and economic standing. By providing 
career guidance, mentoring, and oﬀering access to 
market-relevant certiﬁcations and real-time projects, YEP 
equips the youth to navigate opportunities in the Indian job 
market.
Since its inception, the program has: 
• Provided youth from marginalized groups across the 
country access to opportunities. 
• Enhanced the socio-economic status of more than 
1,76,000 youth and their families. 
•  Created speciﬁc career paths for the youth in 
Hospitality, Banking, Retail, and IT domains, to name a 
few. 
• Facilitated anytime and anywhere learning through 
the one-stop YEP portal. 
• Advanced the reputation of, and provided visibility to, 
YEP partner institutions. 
• Enabled continuous availability of a highly skilled 
talent pool for the industry.
The program currently runs in 24 states and union 
territories of India. In FY 2024, 19,900 students were 
trained, of which 49% were women and from groups 
qualiﬁed for aﬃrmative action programs. Over 2,845 
students have gained employment in the IT/ITES and other 
domains.

Literacy as a Service (LaaS) Case Study
Lighting up the Musahar Community with literacy
LaaS’ modules include functional literacy (50-55 hours), 
ﬁnancial literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness of key citizen 
entitlements (3-4 hours). These are currently available in 
nine Indian, and three foreign languages.
Democratizing the literacy solution, TCS’ Each one 
Empowers one portal provides TCS, Tata Group employees, 
and their families, the opportunity to empower non-liter-
ates such as security guards, domestic workers, and 
gardeners in their local community.
Since its inception, LaaS has successfully paved the way to 
self-reliance for over 2.43 million learners and more than 
201,600 facilitators through literacy. In FY 2024, LaaS 
empowered 20,342 learners (~99% women) with function-
al literacy, ﬁnancial literacy, and awareness of key citizen 
entitlements.
The program’s transformational impact oﬀers beneﬁciaries 
a path to ﬁnancial independence, raises their self-esteem, 
and provides them the opportunity to be role models for 
their children. In addition, the program has also given 
neo-literates better access to government beneﬁt 
schemes, and ﬁnancial systems.
Tara Devi, from Bhaipurkhurd village, in Mirzapur, Uttar 
Pradesh, used to work at a brick kiln, for 14-16 hours 
every day, along with her husband and children. The 
owner of the brick kiln exploited them and paid them 
inadequately. Lacking basic education, Tara and her 
family were unable to accurately calculate their wages 
and were dependent on middlemen. TCS’ Literacy as a 
Service (LaaS), in partnership with Manav Sansadhan 
Evam Mahila Vikas Sansthan (MSEMVS), started a 
literacy program in Bhaipurkhurd. Tara Devi was 
rescued by MSEMVS, and she joined the TCS’ literacy 
center at Bhaipurkhurd.
Attending TCS’ LaaS sessions every day, Tara Devi 
learned how to read basic Hindi and do simple 
arithmetic. MSEMVS assisted Tara in setting up a small 
general shop. She is now able to operate her 
microenterprise independently and personally maintain 
her book of accounts. Realizing the transformative 
power of education, Tara Devi inspires her children to 
take their education seriously. 
I had never thought that I would be 
able to leave the work at the brick kiln 
and open my own shop. Thanks to TCS’ 
Literacy as a Service, I learned basic 
arithmetic, and today I can manage the 
accounts of my shop.  Now I send my 
children to school every day.

Youth Employment Program (YEP) Case Study
A major achievement of BridgeIT in FY 2024 was the 
agreement between TCS and Humana People to People India 
(HPPI), to empower 1,400 rural youth from socially and 
economically marginalized communities across 14 districts of 
Bihar, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan, by building their capacities 
to become digital entrepreneurs.
A TCS Entrepreneur Network (TEN) was created to encourage 
collaborative knowledge sharing and revenue generation 
ideas among existing and future entrepreneurs. The TCS team 
connects regularly with the entrepreneurs for this purpose. 
Training modules were created and conducted on topics such 
as Cyber Security, Cyber Crime, DTP, and Canva.
An in-house guidebook to learn and adopt new ways to 
generate income has also been developed. Additionally, 
Digital Entrepreneur Learning Intervention (DELI), the TCS 
in-house training curriculum, and content for future training 
programs has also been created.
In FY 2024, 348 active digital entrepreneurs (of which 41% 
comprise women and 77% hail from marginalized 
communities) served 1,735 villages, oﬀering services to 
312,175 beneﬁciaries like document generation, government 
scheme enrollment, online form ﬁlling, and banking 
transactions, among others. 
Launched a decade ago, TCS’ BridgeIT program addresses the 
socio-economic divide in India by creating rural digital 
entrepreneurs. These digipreneurs use information technology 
to help citizens in local communities avail government 
entitlements by providing ﬁnancial and digital services in 
education, employment, and adult literacy, enabling social 
integration.
Operating in 29 districts across 10 states, the program focuses 
on addressing social inequities, particularly among women and 
marginalized communities. By creating entrepreneurs in rural 
India, BridgeIT solves for rural India, in rural India.

community married young, she was diﬀerent. Driven by 
the ambition to achieve something signiﬁcant in life, 
she delayed starting a family with her husband. In 2020, 
on hearing news of TCS's BridgeIT, Shashi decided to 
enroll in the program. Equipped with training, a laptop, 
and determination, she transformed a room in her

Initially oﬀering a few services, Shashi gradually 
expanded to oﬀer 24 services to her community, 
including PAN cards and ﬁnancial services. With time, 
Shashi gained recognition in her village. Her success 
propelled her to run for Mukhiya in Jharkhand, earning 
the moniker of "Digital Mukhiya."
Shashi's journey exempliﬁes the enabling and 
transformative potential of women's agency and

Around the world, there are more jobs in STEM and the 
computer sciences than there are qualiﬁed candidates to ﬁll 
them. There is also a lack of understanding of what goes into 
becoming a STEM or computer science professional. The 
National Science Foundation predicts that 80% of the jobs that 
will be created in the next decade will require skills in 
mathematics and science. TCS’ ﬂagship digital innovation and 
career readiness program, go Innovate Together (goIT), 
prepares students with the skills and capabilities required to 
pursue careers of the future.
Through engaging design workshops and custom mentorship 
experiences, goIT helps students by challenging stereotypes 
and inspiring these future leaders to pursue the careers of 
tomorrow. goIT helps students develop core skills in 
partnerships with school districts, using a four-pronged model 
which includes, in-person or virtual volunteer-driven 
engagements, round the year goIT online connects, monthly 
challenges centered around the UN SDGs and mentorship by 
industry professionals from TCS. The impact metrics from 
participating students reinforce the success of the program, 
with 89% aspiring to pursue STEM careers post-program, 96% 
believing they can -create positive community impact, and 99% 
learning new skills from TCS mentor volunteers. goIT’s 
transformative journey helps shape the future of STEM 
education. Since its launch in 2009, goIT has beneﬁtted 
263,282 students with a growing presence across 42 countries.

The world is evolving at a tremendous pace, and now more 
than ever, young people require 21st-century skills, such as 
computational thinking, to keep abreast with the changing

highlight how core school subjects alone will no longer be 
enough.
Computational thinking is a foundational skill that prepares 
students to think, solve, and create. TCS’ Ignite My Future 
(IMF) is a pioneering endeavor to empower educators 
through a transdisciplinary approach that integrates 
computational thinking into core subjects like mathematics, 
science, art, and social studies. Oﬀered for free, IMF enables 
educators to teach students equitably. The program 
highlights the importance of computational thinking as a 
critical skill in a changing world with complex problems that 
require thoughtful solutions. Through TCS volunteering and 
customer engagements with program partners, IMF brings 
career pathways to life by creating awareness for students on 
potential careers. IMF consistently engages with educators 
and students through the Learning Leaders network, family 
STEM nights, and special student projects.

Volunteering has a new home at TCS. Hours of Purpose by 
Employees (HOPE) is a transformational movement that allows 
TCS’ growing, highly skilled, and diverse personnel to 
champion purpose projects and give back to society.
The program transformed volunteering from an occasional 
activity into a strategic force for positive change. Through 
HOPE, employees can choose activities in diﬀerent localities, 
along with corporate-driven programs, primarily focused on 
the 17 UN SDGs. All HOPE projects are guided, monitored, and 
driven by ‘Purpose Councils’ comprising leaders from regions 
and business units who believe in the Tata Ethos of giving back 
to society. TCS believes that HOPE’s strong, purpose-driven 
ecosystem is vital to create change that will stand the test of 
time and generate positive impact.
TCS: #1 company for volunteers
Through HOPE, TCS became the leading company for 
volunteers. For the ﬁrst time, multiple volunteering events 
(over 250) were organized under one platform, allowing 
182,000 volunteers to choose what they volunteer for, how 
they volunteer (DIY/virtual/in-person), and who they volunteer 
with (friends and family).
And miles to go…
In FY 2024, HOPE resulted in a collective impact of 6.72 million 
volunteer hours, primarily addressing six SDGs. The platform 
reached 11.17 PCVH (Per Capita Volunteering Hours) and 
positively impacted 5.41 million lives. As more TCSers and 
their friends and family join hands with HOPE, striving to be 
purposeful stewards of their communities, this movement is 
set to continuously grow and touch more lives.

TCS inculcates a healthy lifestyle among its employees and 
communities by oﬀering work-life balance and providing 
support for emotional wellness. When people feel 
psychologically safe, they build positive workplace 
relationships, realize their potential, proactively take on 
responsibilities, and make meaningful contributions to 
society.
Programs like HOPE, Fit4Life, SafetyFirst, and TCS Cares help 
create awareness about physical and emotional well-being. 
These programs also provide employees the opportunity to 
engage with the community purposefully.
Statista forecasts that by 2050, seniors will account for a 
third of Singapore's population. TCS launched Seniors Lab, a 
pilot digital program for integrated senior care to help 
seniors live and age with conﬁdence, in partnership with Sree 
Narayana Mission (SNM) in Singapore. Designed to address 
rising healthcare costs, Seniors Lab leverages technology to 
create an integrated care delivery system that lowers the 
cost of delivering care while helping the seniors of SNM lead 
safer, more comfortable, and independent lives.

Contributions to Disaster Relief Eﬀorts
Disaster relief eﬀorts are crucial in mitigating the impact of 
natural and human-made catastrophes. TCS extended its 
support by mobilizing resources and oﬀering aid to several 
aﬀected areas to help restore stability and hope.
TCS continued its partnership with the American Red Cross, 
providing disaster response training on Mass Care, 
Sheltering and Feeding as well as on Hands Only CPR 
awareness and Fire Safety. TCSers supported the community 
in the aftermath of the Hawaii Wildﬁre, bringing relief to 
over 1,600 residents. The TCS NYC Marathon also saw the 
largest ever fundraising in support of the Greater NY Region 
chapter of the Red Cross.
In Canada, TCS volunteers participated in MapSwipe sessions 
helping pinpoint where critical infrastructure and populations 
are located for mappers. This helps disaster responders oﬀer 
eﬃcient and eﬀective responses. Volunteers also supported 
Red Cross’ Mobile Food Clinic to ﬁll hampers and pack food 
items.
In February 2024, a large ﬁre aﬀected the communes of 
Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Quilpué and Villa Alemana, in the 
Valparaíso Region in Chile. This has been categorized as one 
of the largest disasters in the country in the last 30 years. TCS 
Chile joined the aid campaign with the Chilean Red Cross, 
generating aid for non-perishable food and cleaning supplies 
that helped provide immediate assistance to multiple families

 No. This is not applicable t
o TCS. TCS does not have any physical products as a part of its offerings to customers. TCS is primarily 
an IT services organization and products, if any, are typically software products. Hence the applicability of life-cycle approach 
to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products 
procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life cycle 
philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for purchase 
and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.

Health and safety practices TCS’ supply chain sustainability requirements are integrated with online procurement platform with 
the ‘Sourcing module’ and ‘Risk module’. TCS’ HSE policies, procedures, guidelines, and Supplier 
Code of Conduct (SCoC) are included in sourcing module in RFP template for digital acceptance by 
all suppliers / vendors who are considered for evaluation.
Some critical suppliers such as regulated waste disposal services (e-waste, hazardous waste, 
battery wastes), bottled water suppliers, food suppliers for cafeteria and similar suppliers undergo 
legal compliance due diligence and site inspection before initiating the negotiation process. The 
procurement team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done by vendors and all compliances are in 
place for which a tracking system is maintained.
TCS also conducts periodic audits/review of processes/documents of on-boarded vendors who 
have contractual agreement.

ages with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, to deepen its insights into their needs and expectations, and to develop 
sustainable strategies for the short, medium and long term. Stakeholder engagement also helps to manage risks and 
opportunities in business operations. The key stakeholders identified in consultation with the company’s management are: 
customers, employees, shareholders, academic institutions, staffing firms, other suppliers, technology partners and collaborators, 
industry bodies, governments, NGOs, local communities, regulators and society at large.
 Some other st
akeholders that TCS closely engages with – such as industry analysts, equity analysts, and the news media are 
proxies for other named stakeholders i.e. customers, shareholders, and society at large, respectively.
 Stak
eholder interactions might be structured (e.g. surveys, account statements) or unstructured (town halls, 1x1 or group 
meetings). Based on mutual convenience and need, the engagement may be scheduled as needed, or pre-scheduled on a 
periodic basis, or ongoing (e.g. website, social media).

PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment
Essential Indicators
1. Det
ails of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format72:
 Electricity from the grid is the mos
t significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable 
Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and 
procurement from third party producers in India. In certain countries, Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC) have been procured to 
meet out carbon neutrality objectives in those geographies. The RE consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has 
increased from 55.2% in FY 2022-23 to 74% in FY 2023-24. Electricity consumption across TCS operations increased by  
14.6% y-o-y on account of increased scale of operations in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year, due to more associates 
returning to office. An inclusion of 14 locations globally in the reporting boundary during the current year attributed to a 2.8% 
increase leading to an overall increase in electricity consumption. .
 Other sources of ener
gy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, mostly in 
overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel generators 
(mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).

8. Does the entity ha
ve any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details76.
 Yes. T
CS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net 
zero by 2030. To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, 
green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.
 Commitment t
o Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
 In June 2022, TCS has r
esponded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero 
through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking 
action - https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets 
for validation by SBTi.
 Green In
frastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
 All new c
ampuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have 
roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total Built Up Area occupied by TCS has increased 
YoY from 36.6 Mn to 38.23 million sq.ft. in FY 2023-24. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its 
green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2023-24, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional existing 
buildings namely Sholinganallur, Chennai and Deccan Park, Hyderabad. The % green certified area over built up area was 64.6% in  
FY 2022-23 and has incr
eased to 67.3% this year . This accounts for 39 TCS offices and campuses with over 25.74 million sq.ft of 
area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.
75  GRI 305-1; GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4. Scope 1 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the DEFRA conversion factors 
2023. For Scope 2 emissions – for India, the source is the emission factor is the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User Guide, 
Version 19.0, December 2023, published by the Central Electricity Authority of India. This emission factor [(0.716 tCO2/ MWh) by CEA includes 
the captive power injection into the grid and is adjusted for RE transactions through open access (in power exchanges)]. As TCS, India procures 
electricity from the India grid, which is a mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.716 tCO2/ MWh is considered more 
appropriate. For Australia, Canada, North America, and UK emission factors specific to the region published by local authorities are used. For 
other countries IEA v6 emission factors (01/2024) and GHG protocol v19 (04/2023) – eGRID 2021 have been used as appropriate to the source of 
electricity procured.76 GRI 305-5

s.
 • Replacemen
t of R-22 based & fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment
 • Modular UPS which can modula
te its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
 • Life cy
cle based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce our energy 
consumption.
 • Energy op
timization in our operations through iOT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated feedback 
mechanism
 • As our commitmen
t to energy conservation and management, 2 additional campuses in India were certified to ISO 
50001:2018 standards for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) in FY 2023-24, making it to a total of 22 campuses certified 
to ISO 50001:2018 across TCS India.
 Green IT
:
 Initiativ
es in green Information Technology (IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce 
the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment 
rooms. TCS’ data centers at Yantra Park (Thane) and Siruseri (Chennai) have a weighted average PUE of 1.7. Apart from the two 
main data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE has 
reduced from 1.88 in FY 2022-23 to 1.76 in FY 2023-24.
 The dat
a centre at Yantra Park uses 100% Renewable Energy (RE) while the one at Siruseri uses 73% RE. The power consumed by 
the data centers at Yantra Park and Siruseri were 5.52 MWh and 1.65 MWh respectively during the reporting year FY 2023-24. In 
addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.
 TCS
’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize 
the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe 
Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and 
facilities’ energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:
 • IT Equipmen
t optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)
 • UPS optimiz
ation (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)
 • Cooling optimiz
ation (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1 deg C, 
replacing old with new technology cooling units) 
 • Leakag
e reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle 
containment, blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning
 Rene
wable Energy:
 The roof t
op solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3 percent of total electricity use in 
FY 2023-24. A rooftop solar PV of 260 KWp has been planned for implementation in early FY 2024-25. The Company increased 
its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, 
Kochi and Trivandrum branches, b) Green energy units procurement through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) at two locations 
in Chennai viz. Ambattur and Chennai One, Magnum, which cumulatively added about 6.5 million green units to the renewable 
energy portfolio). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 74 percent of total 
energy use.

9. Pro
vide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format77:
 TCS being an IT ser
vices and consulting organization, TCS does not manufacture physical products and therefore do not use any 
hazardous or toxic chemicals in core processes. The Company have office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from 
the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, 
electrical, and municipal solid waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil 
are generated in relatively smaller proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. 
E-waste is disposed to government approved e-waste recyclers.
 TCS is c
ommitted to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 
100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and 100% recycling of office and 
packaging paper and plastic. All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with 
on-site food waste management facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated 
by vermicomposting at TCS campuses where feasible. The company targets to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste 
categories to divert waste from landfill.
 In FY 2023-24, TCS has ob
tained zero waste to landfill (ZWL) certification was obtained for TCS Deccan Park facility at Hyderabad 
after having achieved a diversion rate of over 99% waste from landfill. This was done as a pilot project for feasibility. 
 TCS has oper
ational control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes which is 
available on the TCS intranet that has set procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste 
categories.

83  GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2024 when compared to FY 
2023. Scope 3 emissions: 
Category 1 & 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG 
Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment, 
vehicles, and furniture items. The US EPA emission factors for categories 1 & 2 were adopted in FY23 and used in FY24 as well. There is a 
significant increase in Category 1 due to a new contract. Increase in category 2 is due to Return to Office (RTO)  
Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned 
vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category 
since  FY 2023 and the same has been continued in FY2024 as well. There is an increase in emissions due to use of IEA emission factors for WTT 
and T&D in FY24. In FY23 the Company had used the DEFRA emission factors.  
Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other 
supplies. While the Company continues to capture emissions from transportation of IT assets based on spend based emission factors, emissions 
related to transportation of non -IT supplies were included. The non – IT supplies covered to estimate category 4 emissions include cafeteria/ 
canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material, and other stationary supplies. Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 
2023 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. There is a significant decrease in this category as the actual data were taken 
from the locations in FY24 compared to FY23 which was based on pilot study at few locations. The Company has also moved the waste disposal 
related transport emissions from Category 4 to 5 in FY24. . 
Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2024. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different 
categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from 
DEFRA 2023. Slight increase in emission due to increased RTO and also due to inclusion of waste disposal related transportation under this 
category.  
Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, business travel emissions also include hotel 
stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023.  There is an increase in emissions due 
to increase in business travel and accommodation due to resumption and RTO. 
Category 7: In FY 2024, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees, 
personal employee commute, public employee commute & work from home (WFH) emissions. There is an increase in employee commute due to 
RTO in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year .

Engagements, issued by the IAAS B. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.

Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI 
The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the 
criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
substantial inherent measurement uncertainty , for example , GHG emissions, water footprint, energy 
footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty 
in the amounts and metrics.  
 
Our responsibilities 
We are responsible for: 
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability 
disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above.  
• Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained, and 
• Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited.  
 
Exclusions 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a opinion on the same: 
• Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”. 
• Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI. 
• Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.  
• The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future 
intentions provided by the Company. 
 
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion 
We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.  
Reasonable assurance opinion 
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether 
due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding 
the Information subject to reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an 
understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to

on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we:

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of
Tata Consultancy Services Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which 
comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, 
and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including 
other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for 
the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements, including material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the 
consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give 
a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs 
of the Group as at 31 March 2024, of its consolidated profit and 
other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity 
and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  
on Auditing  (SAs)  specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of 
the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit 
evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matter(s)
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method
See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, 
wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage 
of completion computed as per the input method 
based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs.
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price 
contracts where the percentage of completion is 
used as a key audit matter since -
• there is an in
herent risk and presumed fraud 
risk around the accuracy and existence of 
revenues recognised considering the customised 
and complex nature of these contracts and 
significant inputs of IT systems
Our audit procedures included the following:
• Obt
ained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls 
implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue 
and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue 
balances.
• Inv
olvement of our Information technology(‘IT’) specialists, as required:
	  Assessed the IT envir
onment in which the business systems 
operate and tested system controls over computation of revenue 
recognised;
	  Tes
ted  the  IT  controls  over appropriateness of cost and revenue 
reports generated by the system;

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
174 Consolidated Financial Statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
• applica
tion of revenue recognition accounting 
standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts 
with customers) is complex and involves a 
number of key judgments and estimates in 
mainly identifying performance obligations, 
related transaction price and estimating the 
future cost-to- completion of these contracts, 
which is used to determine the percentage 
of completion of the relevant performance 
obligation;
• these con
tracts may involve onerous obligations 
which requires critical assessment of 
foreseeable losses to be made by the Group; 
and
• at y
ear-end, significant  amount of work in 
progress (Contract assets), related to these 
contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
	  Tes
ted the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and 
budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/
changes to costs incurred; and
	  Tes
ted on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the 
estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective 
projects.
• On selected specific and s
tatistical samples of contracts, we tested that 
the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition 
accounting standard including –
	  Ev
aluated  the  identification  of performance obligations and the 
ascribed transaction price;
	  For t
esting the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract 
costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:
		•  
 assessed  that  the  es
timates of costs to complete were 
reviewed and approved by appropriate designated 
management personnel;
		•  
 performed a r
etrospective analysis of costs incurred 
with estimated costs to identify significant variations and 
challenged whether those variations are required to be 
considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the 
contract;
		•  
 assessed the  appropria
teness of work in progress (contract 
assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying 
documentation to identify possible changes in estimated 
costs to complete the remaining performance obligations; 
and
		•  
 inspected underlying documen
ts and performed analytics to 
determine reasonableness of contract costs.
Other Information
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s 
Annual report, but does not include the financial statements 
and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company’s Annual 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of 
this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these 
consolidated  financial statements in term of the requirements 
of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state 
of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding 
the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Management and 
Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
175Consolidated Financial Statements
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing 
the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in 
the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identif
y and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obt
ain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Ev
aluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board of 
Directors.
• Conclude on the appr
opriateness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
• Ev
aluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance of 
the Holding Company and such other companies included in 
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the 
aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred  to  in  paragraph  2A(g)  under  ‘Report  on  Other

Opinion
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year 
ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company and such companies incorporated in India under the 
Companies Act 2013, which are its subsidiary companies, as of 
that date.
In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies 
incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, 
in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and such internal financial 
controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based 
on the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements criteria established by such companies considering 
the essential components of such internal controls stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective Company’s Management and the Board of 
Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls based on the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the respective company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and 
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1) Corporate information
 Ta
ta Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and 
its subsidiaries (collectively together with employee 
welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT 
services, consulting and business solutions and have been 
partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses 
in their transformation journeys. The Group offers a 
consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of 
IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is 
delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile 
delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in 
software development.
 The Company is a public limit
ed company incorporated and 
domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS 
House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March 
31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company 
owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital. 
 The Board of Dir
ectors approved the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
authorised for issue on April 12, 2024.
2) Sta
tement of compliance
 These consolida
ted financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under 
section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as 
amended from time to time.
3) Basis of prepar
ation
 These consolida
ted financial statements have been 
prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured 
at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting 
period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. All 
assets and liabilities have been classified as current and 
non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. 
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration for such services rendered, the Group has 
considered an operating cycle of 12 months.   
 The st
atement of cash flows has been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and items of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities of the 
Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value to be cash equivalents.
 The functional currency of the Compan y and its Indian 
subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency 
of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange 
rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign 
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the 
balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising 
on settlement and restatement are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
foreign currencies are not retranslated.
 The mat
erial accounting policy information related to 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements have 
been discussed in the respective notes.
4) Basis of cons
olidation
 The Company c
onsolidates all entities which are controlled 
by it.
 The Company es
tablishes control when; it has power over 
the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to 
affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant 
activities of the entity.
 Entities c
ontrolled by the Company are consolidated from 
the date control commences until the date control ceases.
 The results of sub
sidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year 
are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and 
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
 The financial st
atements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated in full on consolidation.
 Changes in the Compan
y’s interests in subsidiaries that do 
not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s 
interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which 
the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value 
of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly 
in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.
 Assets and liabilities of en
tities with functional currency 
other than the functional currency of the Company have 
been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such 
entities has been translated using weighted average 
exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been 
reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the 
statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation 
is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, 
significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative 
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
187Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24
amount of exchange differences related to that foreign 
operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of 
profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
5) Use of estima
tes and judgements
 The prepar
ation of consolidated financial statements 
in conformity with the recognition and measurement 
principles of Ind AS requires management of the Group to 
make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent 
liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the 
periods presented.
 Estima
tes and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and future periods are affected.
 The Group uses the f
ollowing critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of 
its consolidated financial statements:
 (a) Re
venue recognition
  Re
venue for fixed-price contracts is recognised 
using percentage-of-completion method. The 
Group estimates the future cost-to-completion of 
the contracts which is used to determine degree of 
completion of the performance obligation.
  The Group e
xercises judgement for identification of 
performance obligations, determination of transaction 
price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation and in determining whether 
the performance obligation is satisfied at a point 
in time or over a period of time. These judgements 
have been explained in detail under the revenue 
recognition note (Refer note 12).
 (b) Useful liv
es of property, plant and equipment
  The Group r
eviews the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. This reassessment may result in change in 
depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 
10(a)).
 (c) Impairment of g
oodwill
  The Group es
timates the value-in-use of the cash 
generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash 
flows after considering current economic conditions 
and trends, estimated future operating results and 
growth rate and anticipated future economic and 
regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are 
developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates 
used for the CGUs represent the weighted average 
cost of capital based on the historical market returns 
of comparable companies (Refer note 10(b)).
 (d) Fair v
alue measurement of financial instruments
  When the fair v
alue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets 
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes 
in assumptions about these factors could affect the 
reported fair value of financial instruments.
 (e) Impairment of financial asse
ts (other than at fair 
value)
  Measuremen
t of impairment of financial assets 
require use of estimates, which have been explained 
in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and 
equity instruments, under impairment of financial 
assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 8)).
 (f) Pro
vision for income tax and deferred tax assets
  The Group uses judg
ements based on the relevant 
rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, 
allowances and disallowances which is exercised while 
determining the provision for income tax. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences and tax 
losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises 
its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting 
period.
 (g) Pro
visions and contingent liabilities
  The Group es
timates the provisions that have present 
obligations as a result of past events and it is probable 
that outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end 
of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimates. 
  The Group uses signific
ant judgements to assess 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising 
from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the 
amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are 
neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements.
 (h) Employ
ee benefits 
  The accoun
ting of employee benefit plans in the 
nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use 
assumptions. These assumptions have been explained 
under employee benefits note (Refer note 14).
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
188 Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24
 (i) Leases
  The Group e
valuates if an arrangement qualifies to 
be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. 
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the 
lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the 
applicable discount rate. 
  The Group de
termines the lease term as the 
noncancellable period of a lease, together with both 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease 
if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; and periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to 
exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group 
is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a 
lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, 
it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that 
create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise 
the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the 
option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the 
lease term if there is a change in the noncancellable 
period of a lease. 
  The discoun
t rate is generally based on the 
incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being 
evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
6) Recen
t pronouncements
 Ministr
y of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued 
from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, 
MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to 
the existing standards applicable to the Group. 
7) Business c
ombinations
 The Group acc
ounts for its business combinations under 
acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition 
for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the 
acquisition date.
 Pur
chase consideration paid in excess of the fair value 
of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where 
the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed 
the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values 
of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is 
recognised as capital reserve.
 The int
erest of non-controlling shareholders is initially 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the 
amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in 
equity of subsidiaries.
 Business combina
tions arising from transfers of interests in 
entities that are under common control are accounted at 
historical cost. The difference between any consideration 
given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in 
shareholders’ equity.
8) 
 Financial asse
ts, financial liabilities and equity 
instruments
 Financial assets and liabilities ar
e recognised when the 
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which 
are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair 
value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or 
financial liability. 
 The Group der
ecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another 
entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, 
and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired.
 Cash and cash equiv
alents
 The Group c
onsiders all highly liquid investments, which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash 
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and 
usage.
 Financial assets a
t amortised cost
 Financial assets ar
e subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
 Financial assets a
t fair value through other 
comprehensive income
 Financial assets ar
e measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
189Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24
 The Group has made an irrevocable election to present 
sub
sequent changes in the fair value of equity investments 
not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
 Financial assets a
t fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets ar
e measured at fair value through profit 
or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of profit and loss. 
 Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities are measur
ed at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
 Equity ins
truments
 An equity instrumen
t is a contract that evidences residual 
interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of 
its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are 
recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.
 Deriva
tive accounting
 • Instrumen
ts in hedging relationship
  The Group designa
tes certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts as 
hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. 
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
  The Group uses hedging ins
truments that are 
governed by the financial risk management policy as 
approved by the Risk Management Committee. The 
policy provides principles on the use of such financial 
derivatives consistent with the risk management 
strategy of the company and its subsidiaries. While 
determining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Group 
takes into consideration the prevailing macro-
economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of 
the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge 
ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging 
activities are reviewed by the Risk Management 
Committee every quarter and future course of action 
is determined.
  The hedge ins
truments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Group determines the existence of 
an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, 
amount and timing of their respective cash flows. 
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce 
the risk associated with the exposure being hedged 
is assessed and measured at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no 
longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have 
been accumulated in other equity are immediately 
reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the 
statement of profit and loss.
  The eff
ective portion of change in the fair value of the 
designated hedging instrument is recognised in the 
other comprehensive income and accumulated under 
the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
  The Group separ
ates the intrinsic value and time value 
of an option and designates as hedging instruments 
only the change in intrinsic value of the option. 
The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and 
time value of an option is recognised in the other 
comprehensive income and accounted as a separate 
component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified 
into the statement of profit and loss when the related 
hedged items affect profit and loss.
  Hedge acc
ounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity till that time remains and is 
recognised in statement of profit and loss when the 
forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and 
loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes 
ineffective.
 • Instrumen
ts not in hedging relationship
  The Group en
ters into contracts that are effective 
as hedges from an economic perspective, but they 
do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in 
the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
 Impairment of financial asse
ts (other than at fair value)
 The Group assesses a
t each date of balance sheet whether 
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. 
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured 
through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime 
expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade 
receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. 
In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, 
the Group has used a practical expedient by computing 
the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables 
based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into 
account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted 
for forward looking information. The expected credit loss 
allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that 
are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. 
For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are 
measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected 
credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time 
expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial 
asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

 Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, 
approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other 
financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value 
due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of 
investments carried at amortised cost is `1,215 crore and `5,587 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(j) Fair v
alue hierarchy
 The fair v
alue hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable 
or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
 • Lev
el 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 • Lev
el 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 • Lev
el 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in 
part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market 
transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
 The cos
t of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide 
range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

tive financial instruments and hedging activity
 The Group’
s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs 
are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations. 
 The Board of Dir
ectors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk 
management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the 
guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, 
currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

 The Group is e
xposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which 
may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks 
associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of 
the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Group.

 Market risk
 Marke
t risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, 
interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign 
currency exchange rate risk.

  The fluctuation in f
oreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and 
loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where 
assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering 
the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from 
fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. 
  The Group, as per its risk manag
ement policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any 
movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact 
the Group’s revenue in international business.
  The Group e
valuates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It 
hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
  The for
eign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a 
simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of 
Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
  The follo
wing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and 
  Ta
ta Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and 
other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative 
contracts entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).

 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising fr
om counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms 
or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well 
as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous 
basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 5 for methods, assumptions 
and information used to measure expected credit losses.
 Financial instrumen
ts that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial 
instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of `170 crore are with 
a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include an amount of `5,197 
crore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s total bank 
deposits as at March 31, 2024. None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.
 • Exposure t
o credit risk
  The carr
ying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk was `2,96,130 crore and `1,09,258 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the total 
of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and 
other financial assets.
  The Group’
s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade 
receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2024 and 2023.
 • Geographic c
oncentration of credit risk
  Geographic c
oncentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:
As at March 31, 2024 As at March 31, 2023
Gross% Net% Gross% Net%
United States of America  42.07  42.67  43.65  44.31

  Geographic
al concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the 
location of the customers.
  The allow
ance for lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was 
`98 crore and `126 crore respectively. The reconciliation of allowance for expected credit losses is as follows:

 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk re
fers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is 
to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group consistently generated 
sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its financial obligations including lease liabilities as and when they fall due.

 The Company
’s objective for capital management is to maximise shareholder value, safeguard business continuity and support 
the growth of the Company. The Company determines the capital requirement based on annual operating plans and long-term 
and other strategic investment plans. The funding requirements are met through equity and operating cash flows generated. The 
Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
 The Board of Dir
ectors at its meeting held on October 11, 2023, approved a proposal to buy-back upto 4,09,63,855 equity shares 
of the Company for an aggregate amount not exceeding `17,000 crore, being 1.12% of the total paid up equity share capital at 
`4,150 per equity share. The shareholders approved the same on November 15, 2023, by way of a special resolution through 
postal ballot. A Letter of Offer was made to all eligible shareholders. The Company bought back 4,09,63,855 equity shares out 
of the shares that were tendered by eligible shareholders and extinguished the equity shares on December 13, 2023. Capital 
redemption reserve was created to the extent of share capital extinguished (`4 crore). The excess cost of buy-back of `17,046 
crore (including `46 crore towards transaction cost of buy-back) over par value of shares and corresponding tax on buy-back of 
`3,959 crore were offset from retained earnings.

9) Leases
 A con
tract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration. 
 Group as a lessee
 The Group acc
ounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the 
contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of 
the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components. 
 The Group r
ecognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease 
commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling 
and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use 
assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
205Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24
 The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
da
te of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily 
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably 
similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease 
or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease 
payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate 
the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease 
liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any 
reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount 
of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit 
and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero 
and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-
measurement in statement of profit and loss.
 The Group has elect
ed not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these 
leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 Group as a lessor
 At the incep
tion of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group 
recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a 
finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on 
the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease 
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from 
the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the 
exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. 
 If an arrang
ement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with 
customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.
 The det
ails of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:

10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities
(a) Property
, plant and equipment
 Pr
operty, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment 
loss, if any.
 Deprecia
tion is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value 
over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories 
of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and 
residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a 
prospective basis. 
 The estima
ted useful lives are as mentioned below:
Type of asset Useful lives
Buildings 20 years*
Leasehold improvements Lease term
Plant and equipment 10 years*
Computer equipment 4 years*
Vehicles 4 years*
Office equipment 2-5 years*
Electrical installations 4-10 years*
Furniture and fixtures 5 years*
 * The Group belie
ves that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best 
represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.
 Deprecia
tion is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for 
its intended use.
 Pr
operty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the asset belongs. 
 If the rec
overable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

 (b) Goodwill
  Goodwill repr
esents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of 
the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the 
implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount. 
  CGUs t
o which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication 
for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic 
uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and 
subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

  Goodwill of `
689 crore and `685 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business 
in France. The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate 
for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 8.67%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the 
computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on 
reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease 
below its carrying amount.
  The remaining amoun
t of goodwill of `1,143 crore and `1,173 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, (relating 
to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the 
recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

 (c) Other int angible assets
  Int
angible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, 
as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.
  Int
angible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles. 
  Follo
wing table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated useful lives:
Type of asset Useful lives
Rights under licensing agreement and software licences Lower of licence period and 2-5 years
Customer-related intangibles 3 years
  Int
angible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.
  Int
angible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and 
the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs. 
  If the rec
overable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

12) Revenue recognition
 The Group earns r
evenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Group offers a consulting-
led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
  Re
venue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
 • Re
venue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts 
expended, number of transactions processed, etc. 
 • Re
venue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide 
services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
 • In respect of other fix
ed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of 
accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract 
costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  
 • Re
venue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software 
is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where 
implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services 
and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method . 
 • Re
venue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the 
customer. 
 • The solutions offer
ed by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for 
supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the 
principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is 
acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.  
 Re
venue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level 
credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue 
also excludes taxes collected from customers.
 The Group’
s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The 
Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer 
to benefit independently from such deliverables.
 Judgemen
t is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each 
distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable 
consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and 
incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant 
financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for 
a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction 
price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will 
not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations 
to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct 
performance obligations.
 The Group e
xercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period 
of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls 
the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such 
product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
 Contr
act fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for 
capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of 
this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be 
used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
215Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24
 Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified 
as unbilled r
eceivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of 
time is required, as per contractual terms. 
 Unearned and def
erred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
 The billing schedules agreed with cus
tomers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress 
payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
 In accor
dance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. 
 Contr
acts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new 
performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is 
revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
 The Group disag
gregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.
 Re
venue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:
(` crore)
Year ended  
March 31, 2024

Consultancy services 2,38,135 2,23,332
Sale of equipment and software licences  2,758  2,126 
2,40,893 2,25,458
 Re
venue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).
 While disclosing the aggr
egate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially 
satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the 
Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price 
allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised 
corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts. 
 Unsatis
fied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, 
changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). 
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,65,314 crore 
out of which 47.69% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter . No consideration from 
contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

14) Employee benefits
 Defined bene
fit plans
 For de
fined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and 
unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the 
entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits. 
 The re
tirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
 The Group pr
ovides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are 
treated as defined benefit plans.
 Defined c
ontribution plans
 Contributions t
o defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
 The Group pr
ovides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined 
contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.
 Short-t
erm employee benefits
 All employ
ee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee 
benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the 
employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal 
or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
 Compensat
ed absences
 Compensat
ed absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are 
not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

 Gra
tuity and pension
 In accor
dance with Indian law, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries in India operate a scheme of gratuity which 
is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in 
employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year 
of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. 
Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas subsidiaries of the Company also provide for retirement 
benefit pension plans in accordance with the local laws.
 The follo
wing table sets out the details of the defined benefit retirement plans and the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements:

Weighted average duration of defined benefit 
obligations
 2-11 Years  3-27 Years  2-13 Years  3-28 Years 
 Future mort
ality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority 
of India.
 The expect
ed benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as 
at March 31, 2024. The Group is expected to contribute `40 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending  
March 31, 2025 comprising domestic component of `8 crore and foreign component of `32 crore.
 The significan
t actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected 
salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 If the discoun
t rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2024
As at  
March 31, 2023
Increase of 0.50%  (272)  (265)
Decrease of 0.50%  300  290 
 If the expect
ed salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as 
follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2024
As at  
March 31, 2023
Increase of 0.50% 163 155
Decrease of 0.50%  (157)  (147)
 The sensitivity analysis pr
esented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 Furthermore, in pr
esenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the 
defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
 Each y
ear an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are 
analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

 Pro
vident fund
 In accor
dance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set 
up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit 
plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest 
rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government 
administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as 
an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund 
liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there 
is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected 
amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered 
provident fund.
 All eligible employ
ees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in 
which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident 
fund plan. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined 
contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions 
made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

17) Income t
axes
 Income t
ax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year . 
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
 Curren
t income taxes
 The curren
t income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The 
current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax 
relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
 Curren
t income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the 
jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income 
tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
 The curren
t income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary 
in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.
 Advance t
axes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and 
income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and 
liability on a net basis.
 Def
erred income taxes
 Def
erred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised 
for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, 
except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. 
 Def
erred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
 The carr
ying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
 Def
erred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 Def
erred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the 
years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
 For oper
ations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of 
those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after 
the tax holiday ends.
 Def
erred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

 Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be 
a
vailable for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance 
sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will 
be realised.

 Under the Income-t
ax Act, 1961, Tata Consultancy Services Limited is liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax in the tax holiday 
period. MAT paid can be carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future tax liabilities. MAT is 
recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic 
benefit associated with the asset will be realised. 
 Def
erred tax liability on temporary differences of `7,473 crore as at March 31, 2024, associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
has not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries 
for the foreseeable future.
 Direct t
ax contingencies 
 The Company and its sub
sidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other 
jurisdictions where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation 
or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. Contingent liability in respect of 
tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions is `1,871 crore and `1,542 crore as at March 
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the 
management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Ser
ve 
Limited.
 The Group periodic
ally receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations in the 
jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income 
tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.
 The number of year
s that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2022 
are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies 
to fiscals 2020 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state. In United Kingdom, the statute of limitation 
generally applies to fiscal 2019 and earlier .

19)  Segment in formation
 Opera
ting segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is 
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The 
Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.
 The Group has iden
tified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise: 
1) Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Consumer Business, 4) Communication, Media and Technology, 
5) Life Sciences and Healthcare and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and Products. 
 Re
venue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not 
directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated revenue of the segment. All other 
expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.
 The assets and liabilities of the Gr
oup are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not 
practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been 
identified to any of the reportable segments. 
 Summarised segment in
formation for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:

241Standalone Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Members of  
Tata Consultancy Services Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the standalone financial statements of Tata 
Consultancy Services Limited (the “Company”) which comprise 
the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the 
Standalone Financial Statements 
standalone statement of profit and loss (including other 
comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in 
equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the year 
then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, 
including material accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone 
financial statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs 
of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and its profit and other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for 
the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with 
the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act 
and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the 
Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key Audit Matter(s)
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method
Refer Note 4(a) and 10 to the standalone financial statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price 
contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using 
the percentage of completion computed as per the 
input method based on the Company’s estimate of 
contract costs.
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price 
contracts where the percentage of completion is 
used as a key audit matter since -
• there is an inher
ent risk and presumed fraud 
risk around the accuracy and existence 
of revenues recognised considering the 
customised and complex nature of these 
contracts and significant inputs of IT systems;
Our audit procedures included the following:
• Obt
ained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls 
implemented by the Company for recording and computing revenue and 
the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.
• Inv
olvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:
   Assessed the IT envir
onment in which the business systems operate 
and tested system controls over computation of revenue recognised;
   Tes
ted the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue 
reports generated by the system;
   Tes
ted the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and 
budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/
changes to costs incurred; and

242 Standalone Financial Statements
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
• applica
tion of revenue recognition accounting 
standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts 
with customers) is complex and involves a 
number of key judgments and estimates in 
mainly identifying performance obligations, 
related transaction price and estimating the 
future cost-to- completion of these contracts, 
which is used to determine the percentage 
of completion of the relevant performance 
obligation;
• these con
tracts may involve onerous 
obligations which requires critical assessment 
of foreseeable losses to be made by the 
Company; and
• at y
ear-end, significant amount of work in 
progress (Contract assets), related to these 
contracts are recognised on the balance 
sheet.
   Tes
ted on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the 
estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective 
projects.
• On selected specific and s
tatistical samples of contracts, we tested that 
the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition 
accounting standard including –
   Ev
aluated the identification of performance obligations and the 
ascribed transaction price;
   For t
esting the Company’s computation of the estimation of contract 
costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:
  • assessed tha
t the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed 
and approved by appropriate designated management 
personnel;
  • performed a r
etrospective analysis of costs incurred with 
estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged 
whether those variations are required to be considered in 
estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract;
  • assessed the appropria
teness of work in progress (contract 
assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying 
documentation to identify possible changes in estimated costs 
to complete the remaining performance obligations; and
  • inspected underlying documen
ts and performed analytics to 
determine reasonableness of contract costs.

responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual 
report, but does not include the financial statements and 
auditor’s report(s) thereon. The Company’s annual report 
is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act 
with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial 
statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, 
profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in 
equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 
133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of 
adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions 
of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation 
of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair 
view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the 
Management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of 
Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial 
statements.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
243Standalone Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identif
y and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obt
ain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) 
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements in 
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Ev
aluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board of 
Directors.
• Conclude on the appropria
teness of the Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparation of standalone financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as 
a going concern.
• Ev
aluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the standalone financial statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial 
statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

249Standalone Financial Statements
Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the 
aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of 
Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal 
and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even 
date)
Opinion
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the 
Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of 
the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year 
ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements and such internal financial controls were operating 
effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 
“Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including 
adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an 
audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements were established and maintained and if such controls 
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements included obtaining an 
understanding of internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement 
of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to 
Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements include those policies and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions 
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorisations of management and directors of 
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements, including the possibility 
of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial 
controls with reference to financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1) Corporate information
 Ta
ta Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS 
Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting 
and business solutions and has been partnering with many 
of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation 
journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive 
powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and 
engineering services and solutions. This is delivered 
through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery 
model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software 
development.
 The Company is a public limit
ed company incorporated and 
domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS 
House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at  
March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding 
company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share 
capital.
 The Board of Dir
ectors approved the standalone financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
authorised for issue on April 12, 2024.
2) Sta
tement of compliance
 These st
andalone financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to 
time.
3) Basis of prepar
ation
 These st
andalone financial statements have been prepared 
on historical cost basis except for certain financial 
instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured 
at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting 
period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of 
the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. 
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and 
non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. 
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers 
and time elapsed between deployment of resources 
and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the 
consideration for such services rendered, the Company has 
considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
 The st
atement of cash flows has been prepared under 
indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or 
payments and items of income or expense associated 
with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities of the Company 
are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value to be cash equivalents.
 These st
andalone financial statements have been prepared 
in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the 
Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at 
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses 
arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in 
the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in 
foreign currencies are not retranslated.
 The mat
erial accounting policy information related to 
preparation of the standalone financial statements have 
been discussed in the respective notes.
4) Use of estima
tes and judgements 
 The prepar
ation of standalone financial statements 
in conformity with the recognition and measurement 
principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company 
to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent 
liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the 
periods presented.
 Estima
tes and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised 
and future periods are affected.
 The Company uses the f
ollowing critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of 
its standalone financial statements:
 (a) Re
venue recognition
  Re
venue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using 
percentage-of-completion method. The Company 
estimates the future cost-to-completion of the 
contracts which is used to determine degree of 
completion of the performance obligation.
  The Company e
xercises judgement for identification of 
performance obligations, determination of transaction 
price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation and in determining whether 
the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in 
time or over a period of time. These judgements have 
been explained in detail under the revenue note (Refer 
note 10).
 (b) Useful liv
es of property, plant and equipment
  The Company r
eviews the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment at the end of each reporting 
period. This reassessment may result in change in 
depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 
8(a)).
 (c) Impairment of in
vestments in subsidiaries
  The Company r
eviews its carrying value of investments 
carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, 
or more frequently when there is indication for 
impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its 
carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for 
in the statement of profit and loss.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
257Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24
 (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments
  When the fair v
alue of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, 
their fair value is measured using valuation techniques 
including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs 
to these models are taken from observable markets 
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a 
degree of judgement is required in establishing fair 
values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes 
in assumptions about these factors could affect the 
reported fair value of financial instruments.
 (e) 
 Impairment of financial asse
ts (other than at fair 
value)
  Measuremen
t of impairment of financial assets 
require use of estimates, which have been explained 
in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and 
equity instruments, under impairment of financial 
assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).
 (f) Pro
vision for income tax and deferred tax assets
  The Company uses judg
ements based on the relevant 
rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, 
allowances and disallowances which is exercised while 
determining the provision for income tax. A deferred 
tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences and 
tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company 
exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each 
reporting period.
 (g) Pro
visions and contingent liabilities
  The Company es
timates the provisions that have 
present obligations as a result of past events and it is 
probable that outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at 
the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to 
reflect the current best estimates. 
  The Company uses signific
ant judgements to assess 
contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are 
disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising 
from past events, the existence of which will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly 
within the control of the Company or a present 
obligation that arises from past events where it is 
either not probable that an outflow of resources 
will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable 
estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent 
assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the 
standalone financial statements.
 (h) Employ
ee benefits
  The accoun
ting of employee benefit plans in the 
nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use 
assumptions. These assumptions have been explained 
under employee benefits note (Refer note 12).
 (i) Leases
  The Company e
valuates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. 
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. 
The Company uses significant judgement in assessing 
the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and 
the applicable discount rate. 
  The Company de
termines the lease term as the 
non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both 
periods covered by an option to extend the lease if 
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; and periods covered by an option to terminate 
the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not 
to exercise that option. In assessing whether the 
Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option 
to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to 
terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances that create an economic incentive for 
the Company to exercise the option to extend the 
lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the 
lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a 
change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.
  The discoun
t rate is generally based on the 
incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being 
evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar 
characteristics.
5) Recen
t pronouncements
 Ministr
y of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued 
from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, 
MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to 
the existing standards applicable to the Company.
6) 
 Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity 
ins
truments
 Financial assets and liabilities ar
e recognised when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially 
measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which 
are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than 
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair 
value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or 
financial liability.
 The Company der
ecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, 
or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another 
entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, 
and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or have expired.
 Cash and cash equiv
alents
 The Company c
onsiders all highly liquid investments, which 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are 
subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash 
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

258 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances 
with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and 
usage.
 Financial assets a
t amortised cost
 Financial assets ar
e subsequently measured at amortised 
cost if these financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the 
financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows 
that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
  Financial assets a
t fair value through other 
comprehensive income
 Financial assets ar
e measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
 The Company has made an irr
evocable election to present 
subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments 
not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
 Financial assets a
t fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets ar
e measured at fair value through profit 
or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in 
statement of profit and loss.
 Inv
estment in subsidiaries
 Inv
estment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less 
impairment loss, if any.
 Financial liabilities
 Financial liabilities are measur
ed at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
 Equity ins
truments
 An equity instrumen
t is a contract that evidences residual 
interest in the assets of the company after deducting all 
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue 
cost.
 Deriva
tive accounting
 • Instrumen
ts in hedging relationship
  The Company designa
tes certain foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts as 
hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange 
risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges.
  The Company uses hedging ins
truments that are 
governed by the financial risk management policy as 
approved by the Risk Management Committee. The 
policy provides principles on the use of such financial 
derivatives consistent with the risk management 
strategy of the Company. While determining the 
appropriate hedge ratio, the Company takes into 
consideration the prevailing macro-economic 
conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging 
instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness 
and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are 
reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every 
quarter and future course of action is determined.
  The hedge ins
truments are designated and 
documented as hedges at the inception of the 
contract. The Company determines the existence 
of an economic relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item based on the currency, 
amount and timing of their respective cash flows. 
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce 
the risk associated with the exposure being hedged 
is assessed and measured at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no 
longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have 
been accumulated in other equity are immediately 
reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the 
statement of profit and loss.
  The eff
ective portion of change in the fair value of the 
designated hedging instrument is recognised in the 
other comprehensive income and accumulated under 
the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
  The Company separ
ates the intrinsic value and 
time value of an option and designates as hedging 
instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the 
option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value 
and time value of an option is recognised in the other 
comprehensive income and accounted as a separate 
component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified 
into the statement of profit and loss when the related 
hedged items affect profit and loss.
  Hedge acc
ounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or 
loss recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in equity till that time remains and is 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss when 
the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and 
loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the 
statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes 
ineffective.
 • Instrumen
ts not in hedging relationship
  The Company en
ters into contracts that are effective 
as hedges from an economic perspective, but they 
do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in 
the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
 Impairment of financial asse
ts (other than at fair value)
 The Company assesses a
t each date of balance sheet 
whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets 
is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses 
to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company 
recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets 
and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a 
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
259Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24
financing transaction. In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by 
computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into 
account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is 
based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the 
life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

 Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, approximate the fair 
v
alue due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities 
which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair 
value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `940 crore and `5,351 crore as at 
March 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
(k) Fair value hierarchy 
 The fair v
alue hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable 
or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
 • Lev
el 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 • 
 Lev
el 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 • 
 Lev
el 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in 
part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market 
transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
 The cos
t of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide 
range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

(l) Deriva
tive financial instruments and hedging activity
 The Company
’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the 
costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations. 
 The Board of Dir
ectors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk 
management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under 
the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange 
forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.
 The follo
wing are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges:

`49,180 crore and `46,102 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of these contracts have a net loss of `42 crore and 
gain of `12 crore.
 Exchang
e gain of `30 crore and loss of `1,159 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts that do 
not qualify for hedge accounting have been recognised in the standalone statement of profit and loss for the years ended  
March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 Net f

 Net loss on deriv
ative instruments of `9 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2024, is expected to be 
transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2025. The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow 
variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2024.

(m) Financial risk managemen
t
 The Company is e
xposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which 
may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks 
associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of 
the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Company.
 Marke
t risk
 Marke
t risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, 
interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of 
foreign currency exchange rate risk.

 • Foreign currency exchange rate risk
  The fluctuation in f
oreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities 
are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic 
environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in 
those countries. 
  The Company
, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, 
any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may 
impact the Company’s revenue in international business.
  The Company e
valuates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It 
hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
  The for
eign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a 
simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the 
Company.
  The follo
wing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet 
which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as 
indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

 • Int
erest rate risk
  The Compan
y’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not significantly 
exposed to interest rate risk.
 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising fr
om counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms 
or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well 
as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous 
basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 4 for methods, assumptions 
and information used to measure expected credit losses.
 Financial instrumen
ts that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial 
instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank deposits include an amount of `2,500 
crore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank 
deposits as at March 31, 2024. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit 
risk.

 • Exposure t o credit risk 
  The c

exposure to credit risk was `90,407 crore and `90,655 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the total of 
the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference investments, trade 
receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.

7) Leases
 A con
tract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
 Company as a lessee
 The Company acc
ounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the 
contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of 
the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.
 The Company r
ecognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease 
commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease 
incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling 
and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use 
assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.
 The Company measur
es the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily 
determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably 
similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the 
lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable 
lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to 
exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option 
to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the 
lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect 
any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the 
amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of 
profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero 
and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the 
re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.
 The Company has elect
ed not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these 
leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
275Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24
 Company as a lessor
 At the incep
tion of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The 
Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In 
case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of 
return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the 
head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset 
arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company 
applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
 If an arrang
ement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 - Revenue from contracts with 
customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

ails of the right-of-use assets held by the Company is as follows:

8) Non-financial asse
ts and non-financial liabilities 
(a) Property
, plant and equipment
 Pr
operty, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing 
the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment 
loss, if any.
 Deprecia
tion is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value 
over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories 
of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and 
residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a 
prospective basis.
 The estima
ted useful lives are as mentioned below:
Type of asset Useful lives
Buildings 20 years*
Leasehold improvements Lease term
Plant and equipment 10 years*
Computer equipment 4 years*
Vehicles 4 years*
Office equipment 2-5 years*
Electrical installations 4-10 years*
Furniture and fixtures 5 years*
 * The Company belie
ves that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best 
represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.
 Deprecia
tion is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for 
its intended use.
 Pr
operty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the asset belongs.
 If the rec
overable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

angible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and 
the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) 
to which the asset belongs.
 If the rec
overable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

angible assets consist of the following:

10) Re
venue recognition
 The Company earns r
evenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a 
consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. 
 Re
venue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
 • Re
venue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts 
expended, number of transactions processed, etc. 
 • Re
venue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide 
services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance. 
 • In respect of other fix
ed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of 
accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract 
costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  
 • Re
venue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software 
is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where 
implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services 
and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
 • Re
venue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the 
customer. 
 • The solutions offer
ed by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for 
supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the 
principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is 
acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
 Re
venue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level 
credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue 
also excludes taxes collected from customers.
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
283Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24
 The Company ’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The 
Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer 
to benefit independently from such deliverables.
 Judgemen
t is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each 
distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable 
consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and 
incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant 
financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for 
a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction 
price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will 
not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations 
to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct 
performance obligations.
 The Company e
xercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a 
period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who 
controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of 
such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
 Re
venue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.
 Contr
act fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for 
capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of 
this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be 
used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.
 Contr
act assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified 
as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of 
time is required, as per contractual terms.
 Unearned and def
erred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
 The billing schedules agreed with cus
tomers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress 
payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
 In accor
dance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
 Contr
acts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews 
modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new 
performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is 
revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
 The Company disag
gregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

 Inf
ormation about major customers
 No single cust
omer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.
 While disclosing the aggr
egate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially 
satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the 
Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction 
price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised 
corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts. 
 Unsatis
fied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, 
changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). 
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,34,160 crore 
out of which 50.03% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter . No consideration from 
contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

12) Employee benefits
 Defined bene
fit plans
 For de
fined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the 
changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and 
unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the 
entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
 The re
tirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
 The Company pr
ovides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which 
are treated as defined benefit plans.
 Defined c
ontribution plans
 Contributions t
o defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to 
such benefits.
 The Company pr
ovides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated 
as defined contribution plans.
 Short-t
erm employee benefits
 All employ
ee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee 
benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the 
employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal 
or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
 Compensat
ed absences
 Compensat
ed absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee 
renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are 
not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are 
recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

 Gra
tuity and pension
 In accor
dance with Indian law, the Company operates a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity 
plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of 
employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon 
completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions 
made to the trust. Certain overseas branches of the Company also provide for retirement benefit plans in accordance with the 
local laws.
 The follo
wing table sets out the details of the defined benefit retirement plans and the amounts recognised in the financial

 Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority 
of India.
 The expect
ed benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan 
obligations as at March 31, 2024. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year 
ending March 31, 2025 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2024.
 The significan
t actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected 
salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective 
assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
 If the discoun
t rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:
(` crore)
As at  
March 31, 2024
As at  
March 31, 2023
Increase of 0.50%  (123)  (121)
Decrease of 0.50%  129  127 
 If the expect
ed salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as 
follows:

As at  
March 31, 2023
Increase of 0.50%  130  129 
Decrease of 0.50%  (125)  (123)
 The sensitivity analysis pr
esented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 Furthermore, in pr
esenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the 
defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
 Each y
ear an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are 
analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

 Pro
vident fund
 In accor
dance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident 
fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company 
to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the 
Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared 
by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered 
pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in 
statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund 
liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there 
is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected 
amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered 
provident fund.

15) Income taxes
 Income t
ax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year . 
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
 Curren
t income taxes
 The curren
t income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company having its branches in India and overseas where it 
operates. The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief 
available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
 Curren
t income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the 
jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income 
tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
 Advance t
axes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and 
income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and 
liability on a net basis.
 Def
erred income taxes
 Def
erred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised 
for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, 
except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
 Def
erred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
 The carr
ying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
 Def
erred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the 
years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
 For oper
ations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those 
temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax 
holiday ends.
 Def
erred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
 Def
erred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be 
available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance 
sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will 
be realised.

 Under the Income-t ax Act, 1961, the Company is liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax in the tax holiday period. MAT paid can be 
carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future tax liabilities. MAT is recognised as a deferred tax 
asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset 
will be realised.
 Direct t
ax contingencies

TCS has a Board level Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC) that oversees different aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC)
• The SRC is chair
ed by an independent director and comprises of 3 members including the CEO. It reviews the climate change 
strategy, approach, and performance of the organization with respect to sustainability and climate change. 
• The SRC f
ormally meets twice every year to review policies and sustainability performance, including climate change and carbon 
performance. The board oversight helps drive the program effectively with greater accountability. 
• The CEO
, as a part of the SRC, is directly responsible for the efficient operations of the facility and hence is better able to review 
performance and drive improvement. The updates are provided by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and is supported by 
the Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health and Safety (ESHS) who oversees the environment and climate change implementation 
at the organisation. 
• TCS
’ carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 
base year), and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, was reviewed and approved by the committee.
• Sta
tement by Senior management: Refer page number 132 in BRSR for N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director’s statement. 
• During the half yearly mee
tings, the SRC monitors the progress towards the carbon targets and the carbon reduction initiatives that 
have been implemented and planned.
Competency: 
TCS has a competent team working on Environmental Sustainability. TCS’ Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health, and Safety (ESHS) is 
a Doctorate in Environmental Science and Engineering and has over 30 years of post-doctoral experience in environmental sustainability

• The RMC formula tes, monitors, and reviews the company’s risk management policy.
• Climat
e change risks and opportunities are covered under the strategic and operational risks for the Company and are reviewed in 
the RMC committee meetings.
Section 2: Strategy
Climate related risks continue to challenge businesses in every possible way, sometimes amplifying existing risks. Not only is their nature 
evolving, but their speed of impacting the organisation’s operations is also increasing. Operating in an uncertain and ever-changing 
environment, TCS’ global operations bring in considerable complexities and TCS’ robust enterprise risk management framework aids 
in ensuring the strategic objectives are achieved. This framework enables risk identification for short, medium, and long term, risk 
assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance.
Climate-related risks and opportunities
Refer to the MD&A section on page number 86 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for identified climate-related risk and opportunities 
that could reasonably affect TCS’ prospects. The section includes the company’s adaptation methodology which will be implemented over 
following time horizons:
 Time-horizon From (y ears) To (years)
Short-term 0 5
Medium-term 5 10
Long-term 10 Beyond 10
Below is a brief description of TCS’ approach and identification of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Climate related 
R&O
TCS Approach
Current regulation Regulations undergo frequent changes and, to accommodate such changes, the company must be aware and 
responsive. In India operations, TCS must comply with all the environmental consent conditions around emissions, 
water discharge, waste recycling etc. These regulations are included in TCS’ risk assessment as compliance risk 
and thereafter integrated into its mitigation plans. The company also reports to the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI) mandated BRSR framework, which includes non-financial indicators and is a part of this Integrated 
Annual report. This year as per BRSR reporting requirements, TCS is also undergoing reasonable assurance for the 
core indicators of BRSR.
Emerging 
regulation
Emerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity tariff), 
mandatory energy audits are examples which are likely to impact the company. Regulations around procurement 
of renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolving 
in all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational 
sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes.
Technology With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCS’ offices 
eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and work on 
a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operational risks and 
opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient.
Legal TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others) on 
periodic basis and have a very robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all legal 
requirements of current, amended and new regulations. While the possibility of a litigation risk is very low, climate 
change impacts can pose few risks indirectly to TCS.
Market Climate change is driving a lot of changes in the company’s customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and 
new opportunities, giving TCS an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by 
providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.
Reputation Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly 
aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain 
reputation. Climate risks are hence included as strategic risks which is reviewed by leadership to position the 
company better in the market. This information is required to respond to CDP supply chain module and various 
customer surveys on sustainability like Dow Jones Sustainability Index, EcoVadis, MSCI, Sustainalytics, etc. 
Hence performing well in these ratings/scorings is very crucial in maintaining the market reputation which the 
organization holds.
Acute physical Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in coastal 
cities in India which are exposed to extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood, and cyclones. E.g., The 
company’s offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are exposed to physical risks 
from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.

Climate related 
R&O
TCS Approach
Chronic physical Despite the Paris Agreement and global climate action, global warming continues unabated. Having presence in 
many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change 
in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in few coastal 
cities, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, saltwater intrusion, disruption to network and 
communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning 
appropriate infrastructure. TCS has set targets to reduce carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 70% in 2025 
compared to 2016 base year and achieve Net Zero by 2030. These are aligned with the global goals taken under 
the Paris agreement to fight global warming by keeping the planet’s temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius. TCS 
has reduced its absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 80% in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016, 
exceeding TCS’ target achievement by 10%, one year ahead of time.
Business model and value chain
TCS’ business model and value chain includes its customers and suppliers. The sustainability and climate related transition risks are 
covered here along with some mitigation plans.
Customers: TCS is an IT services and business solution provider company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 corporations 
and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is 
reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP , SBTi commitment, RFPs. These 
all show how adapting to changing customer behaviour around climate change is crucial for business continuity.
TCS’ stakeholders, especially its customers and employees look at it as a responsible corporate citizen when it comes to climate action. 
The company’s efforts in this domain have been recognized through ESG ratings and CDP ratings / climate change performance (carbon 
reduction against targets, % renewable energy). In an event, if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can lead to 
a negative impact on its brand and reputation, as well as ESG ratings. A failure to meet the targets, customer expectations or evolving 
regulatory requirements could also potentially affect its market capitalization. TCS ensures that these risks are identified at an early stage 
and work on mitigation and improvement plans. 
The company also has a robust business continuity plan. It is an end-to-end framework that effectively manages through defined policy, 
procedures, guidelines and through in-house developed tools that support planning and communication with all stakeholders. The 
framework is fully compliant and certified to ISO 22301:2019, CMMI-SVC and is integrated with TCS quality management system for 
consistent deployment across the organization. TCS also has Emergency Preparedness Plans (EPP) for disasters such as earthquake, floods, 
cyclones etc in its internal portal. The plan outlays the responsibilities of action owners, plan description including precautions to be 
taken, evacuation procedures and post incident action plan which would need to be followed at locations facing the emergency scenario.
Suppliers: Towards ongoing sustainability assessment, TCS launched its Supplier Sustainability Assessment Platform in FY 2023 and 
initiated on-boarding of its top supply chain partners. Through this platform, TCS plans to support its suppliers with engagement and 
guidance to help them improve their sustainability performance. In FY 2024, the company has successfully assessed 17% of its value 
chain partners (by spend) for sustainability criteria. These efforts ensure that all suppliers who form upstream part of the value chain are 
assessed for sustainability and climate risks. 
Strategy and decision-making
Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced TCS’ strategy in the following ways:
 Area Description of in fluence
Products and 
services
As TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-
led solutions to help them achieve their sustainability goals. The change in technology consumption reflects the 
prevailing trends in the economy. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight on supply 
chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability imperative. Each of these represents an opportunity 
that can contribute towards the growth of not just as one company, but of the ecosystem. TCS leveraged its deep 
expertise in IoT , advanced analytics, and machine learning to come up with a suite of offerings in this space, 
including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™, and TCS Envirozone™. Clients across industries are 
engaging us to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to measure and 
track green-house gas emissions across their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste 
and promote recycling.

 Area Description of in fluence
Supply chain and/
or value chain
Supply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations that TCS has identified 
under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy outlines its commitment to making its supply chain 
more responsible and sustainable. Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the 
company’s IT assets procurement as this is directly correlated with its emission profile. Climate related risks play a 
very important role in supply chain engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements 
in overall supply chain sustainability related aspects. As mentioned in the previous section on suppliers, TCS has 
launched the supplier sustainability assessment platform to facilitate improvements in the supply chain through 
evaluation and assessment of suppliers.
Investment in R&I TCS’ investments in R&I have resulted in solutions like Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™. TCS has been 
using Clever Energy for the last several years to monitor and help reduce its energy consumption and is now 
commercially selling it and the other two solutions to clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals. 
Additionally, TCS has been investing in building green campuses (IGBC certified). These initiatives have enabled 
reduction of carbon footprint
Operations Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. TCS has created an environmentally 
sustainable approach by creating green policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. The company’s 
campuses are designed to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested 
periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings, efficient operations, green IT, 
the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage 
waste in line with circular economy principles are integral to business operations. These all help the company in 
achieving its emission reduction targets and journey towards Net Zero by 2030.
Direct costs, Capital 
expenditures, 
Capital allocation 
assets
Climate risks and opportunities are one of the factors while making financial considerations especially while 
making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy production. Investment in these areas 
constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green 
buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. Refer BRSR section, Principle 6, page number 152, 
153 for more details on the initiatives that also help the company to position itself as leaders in the climate domain 
hence contribute substantially to its market value.
Financial position, financial performance, and cash flows
Substantive financial or strategic impact of Risk Assessment: 
Climate risks like business disruption, changing regulatory landscape, acute physical stress and transition risks are identified, prioritized, 
assessed and managed by the ERM team. Anything with the potential to disrupt regular operations by more than 10% and triggers 
Business Continuity Plans at the sites is considered as substantial. The financial risk exposure is calculated considering the following 
quantifiable indicators - (1) Proportion of business units affected OR percentage of operations impacted; (2) Probability of occurrence 
of extreme climate related events, and 3) the impact potential at the affected locations based on size of operation. In any given year 
the overall potential financial impact due to an extreme weather event is considered as 0.75% of the revenue. TCS considers a risk 
tolerance of 10% of the exposure for climate related risks and considered as substantive. Based on the severity and the risk exposure, the 
appropriate risk response is finalized, and mitigation actions are assigned to relevant functions.
The company has identified the following climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the 
company’s business:
a. Risk of impact on direct oper
ations: TCS has large operations based out of offices in coastal cities which have a high exposure to 
extreme weather events like high rainfall, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc. During FY 2024, there were no major cyclones that effected 
the company’s campuses. However, earlier event like Cyclone Amphan led to damages in its Kolkata, India campus specifically to the 
rooftop solar PV installations, solar water heater panels, roof mounted HVAC components, HRW electrical panel room, energy bin 
of biogas chamber, apart from multiple water leakages at basement and many other external physical damages. This indicates the 
increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods and the impact these can cause directly 
on the operations. TCS accounts for such risks at design stage through cyclone and flood water resistance considerations while 
constructing new buildings. For greenfield projects, the building structure is designed (a) for seismic load as per IS 1893 (Part-1) 
2016; Amendment No:2-2020 and (b) for wind speeds as per IS 875 codes. 
 TCS has a s
trong business continuity plan (critical business operations can be shifted to another city/country/geography) and 
therefore these physical risks will not affect the business operations significantly, except for the financial implications related to 
infrastructure damages (if any). Hence the potential financial impact due to physical damage because of extreme weather events is 
calculated as a percentage of revenue using a risk factor, which in turn is arrived through the company’s risk assessment exercises. 
The potential financial impact will be 0.75% of the revenue which comes to approximately ₹ 1,807 crores or US$218 million.
b. Risk of increase in c
apital expenditure: TCS is an IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization with a presence across 
multiple geographies, industries, services and products. Being one of the frontrunners in ESG performance, in 2021, the company 
has taken up ambitious carbon targets as mentioned in previous sections and have also achieved its near-term targets 2 years ahead 
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
322 Sustainability Disclosures
of timelines. In FY 2024, TCS has further brought down its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission by 80% over base year 2016.  This was 
despite increased electricity consumption in FY 2024 from employees’ return to office and addition of new offices to the reporting 
boundary. Apart from organizational level commitments, the emerging regulations also motivate TCS to transition towards low 
carbon business. TCS will need additional CAPEX and OPEX to ensure compliance. The company has envisaged this as a risk, and 
is developing greener solutions and transitioning to renewable energy. In FY 2024, RE accounts for 74% of total energy and have 
increased percentage of green tariff.
 i. TCS
’ new campuses are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency to reduce the carbon 
footprint. The company invests in energy efficiency initiatives taking into consideration a payback period of 4-5 years. It is also 
retrofitting its older buildings with energy efficient equipment. 
 ii. TCS
’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative that involves real time monitoring to 
optimize the operational energy efficiency is used across all offices. This smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS 
Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone enabling visualization of data acquired from 
various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors. 
 iii. While the abov
e initiatives were carried out across TCS India campuses, focus towards achieving Net Zero is also driven through 
carbon neutrality across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in North America, UK and Ireland, Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan, Latin 
America, and Middle East & Africa.
c. Risk of Impacting Reput
ation and Brand Value: TCS is an IT services company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 
corporations and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major 
markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP , SBTi 
commitments, RFPs and other surveys/ questionnaires. Thus, in an event if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it 
can impact the company’s brand and reputation, as well as international ESG ratings. The risk due to the same is realized in terms of 
the company’s brand value and the risk is estimated as 0.1% of the same. In FY 2024, TCS brand value rose to US$19.2 billion (Source: 
Brand Finance). Hence, the potential financial impact due to this risk is estimated at US$19.2 million. To mitigate these impacts, the 
company has undertaken many initiatives to mitigate its environmental impact which includes green building design, energy efficient 
building and IT infrastructure, and transition to renewable energy. All the stakeholders are well informed about TCS’ climate change 
performance through its external disclosures which helps to minimize the reputational risks. 
 TCS has iden
tified the following climate-related opportunities with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on 
its business:
 i. TCS h
as a large building footprint with its campuses alone covering more than 38 million sq. ft area in India. Out of this, over 67.3% 
of its buildings are certified to IGBC Green Building standards. TCS has steadily increased its portfolio of green buildings, thereby 
ensuring energy efficiency in its buildings and reducing both emissions and operating expenditures. Apart from this, the company 
is also working on improving and upgrading its energy efficiency in existing buildings. Few years back, TCS India took up a major 
project to change the luminaires to LEDs across its locations which contributed towards significant energy savings. Major retrofits 
were carried out at some locations with legacy infrastructure to improve the efficiency levels. The TCS Remote Energy Management 
and Control program witnessed rapid scaling up and further maturity during the year by leveraging IoT platform to acquire asset 
(chillers, air handling units, etc.) level data which is analyzed to improve asset efficiency and operations. The data center PUE 
(weighted average) of 1.70 was achieved for the corporate data centers at Mumbai and Chennai. In FY 2024, TCS has achieved 
a saving to the tune of 16,301 MWh due to energy saving initiatives. (This includes HVAC energy efficiency projects, UPS based 
energy efficiency projects, expansion in green buildings and real time monitoring of energy efficiency). TCS uses multiple energy 
sources in its daily operations, electricity being the primary source. Majority of the electricity comes from conventional sources, 
but TCS has increased the share of renewable electricity (RE) over the years through onsite rooftop solar generation, third party 
procurement and purchase of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) (in select geographies). The RE consumption as a percentage of 
total electricity consumption has increased from 15.6% in FY 2021 to 74% in FY 2024. TCS’ owned roof top solar projects contribute 
3 % of the same. Apart from roof top solar photo voltaic installations, TCS increased the renewable energy procurement through a 
switch over to green tariffs for operations and open access power purchase agreements (PPA).
 ii. TCS is looking a
t developing solutions that respond to changing consumer behaviour . Through its Connected Marketing team, 
TCS uses sustainability in the social media perspective to better understand the ‘green’ needs of its consumers, and to also 
see how consumers are reacting to the new green products that have been introduced. Changing consumer behaviour and 
expectations are most reflective in the power utility space. Towards this area, TCS has developed several strategic partnerships, 
towards thought-leadership development and solution enhancement (Example: Smart Power and Smart Energy are key solution 
areas of TCS’ Utilities Industry Unit).

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value chain 
and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas 
of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value driver analysis assesses climate risks and 
opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and 
access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of 
operation) and c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the 
transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included 
those from Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar 
energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and 
increased energy demand. Changing customer behaviour and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to 
TCS with a growing number of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or 
emission trading scheme.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change physical risks and opportunities across value chain 
and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of 
potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysis assesses them across 3 stages of 
the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations 
(carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End Markets 
(demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition) The physical risk is assessed using the 
RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between 3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels 
which is a conservative scenario and helps TCS understand the worst-case climate impacts on its operations. The 
inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Govt. of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The 
assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy 
demand. Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include:
1) A robus
t Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events 
2) Inv
estments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).
Section 3: Risk management
At TCS, the Corporate Risk Office, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for driving Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) across all 
functions in line with TCS Global Risk Management Policy. Refer the MD&A section on page numbers 78, for details on how ERM is driven 
across the company on all topics, including climate related risks and opportunities. The company also considers evolving concepts, trends, 
policies, customer requirements, regulations, and climate scenario analysis to identify Risk & Opportunities. The company also considers 
international guidelines/frameworks like GRI, SASB, and CDP for Risk & Opportunity drivers.
Risk Assessment Methodology: Refer the MD&A section page number 79 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for information on 
Enterprise Risk Management process followed at TCS.
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
324 Sustainability Disclosures
All climate-related risks are embedded into entity’s overall risk management process. TCS has an internal application where identified risks 
are baselined at the beginning of the year, tracked quarterly and updated with relevant progress. Each risk has an expiry date. Each risk 
owner responds with the progress and at the end of the financial year ensures closing of the risk.
Section 4: Metrics and targets
Climate related metrics
a. Climat
e-related metrics – Scope 1,2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent are disclosed on 
page number 152, 158 of the BRSR report. The emissions are in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standards. TCS has a robust environmental sustainability tool where all relevant environmental data are collected monthly, 
validated, and internally assured periodically across geographies. All locations within the operational control of TCS are included in 
the boundary of environmental data reporting (consolidated accounting group as per IFRS-S2). GHG emission factors are used from 
the latest version of IEA, DEFRA, USEPA, GHG Protocol All Sector Tools and regional sources for specific geographies (e.g. CEA for 
India) to estimate the GHG emissions. The approach, inputs and assumptions are detailed on Page number 152, 158 as part of the 
BRSR section. The carbon emission data is independently assured by external assurance providers at the end of the financial year . 
In FY 2024, sc
ope 1 and 2 emissions have undergone reasonable assurance and scope 3 has been subject to limited assurance by 
KPMG. TCS reports its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in the Integrated Annual Report and in CDP (Climate change) disclosures.

by the entity, respectively, Page number 135)
f. Int
ernal carbon prices:
 The org
anization has calculated an internal carbon price based on the total investments envisaged for energy efficiency programs, 
transition to renewable energy and other investments towards emission reductions. Currently TCS does not apply this carbon price 
to determine the feasibility of projects or to apply a carbon tax to generate funding for the projects. All these projects and initiatives 
are driven through internal accruals since they align to overall company and Tata Group philosophy. Currently, TCS is not focusing on 
offsetting to drive reductions and the company may take up the carbon cost/tax mechanism in the future to generate budgets for 
purchase of offset instruments. In the coming years, the company may plan to consider applying a carbon tax to business travel (and 
employee commuting-company provided transport) to bring out the “carbon” cost. This will help reduce Category 6 and 7 of Scope 
3 emissions by either reducing travel or switching to carbon efficient means of travel and transportation (like EVs). The price for each 
metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions the entity uses to assess the costs of its greenhouse gas emissions is ₹ 2,365.
 Business decision-making processes this in
ternal carbon price is applied to are:
 • Capital e
xpenditure 
 • Opera

Climate-related targets
TCS’ climate related targets are mentioned along with its metrics, timeline, and performance in page 24, 25 of the Natural Capital section. 
In May 2021, TCS set carbon target of 70% reduction of absolute Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2025 (vs base year 2016) and Net Zero by 2030. 
This target setting is aimed to mitigate the carbon emissions from its activities and enables adapting to climate change risks. The target 
applies to the entity in entirety across geographies. TCS has already achieved 71% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2023 (Vs 
2016) and 80% reduction in FY 2024 (Vs 2016) thereby overachieving the targets much ahead of its timelines. 
The performance against the targets is disclosed in this Integrated Annual Report in the Natural Capital Section on Page numbers 24 and 25. 
TCS has made its commitment to SBTi targets. In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by 
committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can 
be viewed at Companies taking action - Science Based Targets. TCS is working towards submitting the targets for validation by SBTi.

Independent Practitioners’ Limited Assurance Report 
To the Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited  
Assurance report on select sustainability disclosures in the Integrated Annual Report prepared in 
accordance with the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report ing (BRSR) framework and 
with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021 (together called ‘Identified 
Sustainability Information’ (ISI)) of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) (the ‘Company’) for 
the period from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers 
and environmental and social professionals.  
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us 
to believe that the company’s  Identified Sustainability Information on pages [ 127] to [166] and [315] to 
[327]of the Annual Report relating to select GRI and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) 
for the year ended 31 March 2024, subject to limited assurance is not prepared, in all  material respects, in 
accordance with the the World Resource Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainabl e 
Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and

Reporting  Standards), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Reporting Standard , 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and with reference to the GRI Standards (2021) and basis of 
preparation set out in page 128 Section A: General Disclosures 13 of the Integrated Annual Report.  
We do not express an assurance opinion on information in respect of any other information included in the 
Integrated Annual Report 2024 or linked from the Sustainability Information or from the Integrated Annual 
Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos. 
Basis for opinion and conclusion 
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements , issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report. 
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). 
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms 
that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
conclusion. 
 
Other information 
Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on SEBI BRSR Core attributes and 
issued an independent assurance report on 08 May 2024.  
Our report thereon is included with the other information.  
Our limited assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains 
the ‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other 
information, but we have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information. 
 
Other matter 
Select BRSR and GRI attributes  of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the 
previous assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 09 June 2023.  
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Intended use or purpose 
The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the 
BRSR attributes and GRI attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the 
ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of 
materiality. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
 
Responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI) 
The management of the company are responsible for:  
• designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;  
• selecting or developing suitable criteria for prepari ng the Identified  Sustainability Information and 
appropriately referring to or describing the criteria; and 
• preparing the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria. 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI. 
 
Exclusions: 
 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same: 
• Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”. 
• Aspects of the BRSR and GRI attributes and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than 
the ISI. 
• Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. 
• The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future 
intentions provided by the Company.  
 
Inherent limitations 
The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or 
interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. 
Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to 
substantial inherent measurement uncertainty , for example  GHG emissions, water footprint, energy 
footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the 
uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

Our responsibilities 
We are responsible for: 
• planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;  
• forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained; and  
• reporting our conclusion to the Directors of TCS.  
 
Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion 
We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. 
We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for limited assurance conclusion.  
Limited assurance conclusion 
Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the information subject to limited assurance and 
other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to 
arise. In carrying out our engagement, we: 
• assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the i nformation subject to 
limited assurance;  
• interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning 
policies for occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business; 
• through inquiries, obtained an understanding of TCS’s control environment, processes and information 
systems relevant to the preparation of the information subject to limited assurance, but did not evaluate 
the design of particular control activities, obtain e vidence about their implementation or test their 
operating effectiveness; 
• made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of 
the information subject to limited assurance; 
• undertook ten site visits out of which seven were physical site visits and three were virtual site visits ; 
we selected these sites based on the relative size of the workforce of these locations to the total 
workforce, unexpected fluctuations in the information subject to limited assurance since the prior 
period, and sites not visited in the prior period; 
• inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate; 
• applied analytical procedures, as appropriate;  
• recalculated the information subject to limited assurance based on the criteria; and 
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
332 Sustainability Disclosures
 
 
 
5 | Page  
 
• evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to limited assurance to determine whether 
it is consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the 
company’s occupational health and safety. 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had 
a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

TCS Safe Harbor Clause
Certain statements in this release concerning our future prospects are forward-looking statements. 
Forward-looking statements by their nature involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from market expectations. These risks and uncertainties 
include, but are not limited to, our ability to manage growth, intense competition among global 
IT services companies, various factors which may affect our profitability, such as wage increases 
or an appreciating Rupee, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, time and 
cost overruns on fixed-price, fixed-time frame contracts, client concentration, restrictions on 
cross-border movement of skilled personnel, our ability to manage our international operations, 
reduced demand for technology in our key focus areas, disruptions in telecommunication 
networks, our ability to successfully complete and integrate potential acquisitions, liability for 
damages on our service contracts, the success of the companies in which TCS has made strategic 
investments, withdrawal of governmental fiscal incentives, political instability, legal restrictions 
on raising capital or acquiring companies outside India, unauthorized use of our intellectual 
property, cyber attacks or security breaches, pandemics, natural disasters and general economic 
conditions affecting our industry. TCS may, from time to time, make additional written and oral 
forward-looking statements, including our reports to shareholders. These forward-looking 
statements represent only the Company’s current intentions, beliefs or expectations, and any 
forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it was made. The Company 
assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.
