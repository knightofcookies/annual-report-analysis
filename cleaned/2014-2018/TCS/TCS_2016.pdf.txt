Operating margins  were an industry benchmark at 26.4 per cent for the  year, well within our target range of 26-28 per cent.
TCS remained the most profitable company in the Indian  IT services industry posting net margins of 22.4 per cent  and annual net profit of `24,292 crore.
This performance  has enabled your Company to retain its position as the  most valuable company in India with a market  capitalisation of `4,95,770 crore (US$ 74.84 billion) as  on March 31, 2016.
We have continued our practice to consistently reward  our shareholders.
In FY16, our total dividend pay-out  was `43.50 per share including `27 per share proposed  as final dividend.
The earnings per share for the company  increased to `123.28.
Strong Core Performance Your Company’s customer-centric business model and  its philosophy in building new capabilities has led to  increased participation in our customers’ IT spend.
The  core business portfolio has performed very well with all  key segments posting steady growth led by Banking &  Financial Services, Retail, Manufacturing and Life  Sciences - all these industries grew above the company  average growth rate on a constant currency basis.
In terms of markets, growth was well distributed with  North America growing 10.8 per cent, Europe by 12.9  per cent and United Kingdom by 8.3 per cent in constant  currency terms.
India crossed $ 1 billion milestone in  annual revenues while overall revenues from new  Growth Markets exceeded $ 3.3 billion on in FY16.
From a services perspective, growth was led by  Infrastructure services, Products & Platforms  and Assurance services.
Digital services grew by  52.2 per cent annually with revenues crossing the  $ 2 billion mark.
There were some headwinds in the business  environment for your Company.
Adverse cross currency  movements severely impacted the reported US$  revenue of 16.55 billion by 4.8 per cent.
This resulted in  lower US$ revenue growth of 7.1 per cent year-on-year  compared to 11.9 per cent growth in constant currency  terms.
Diligenta, our life and pensions subsidiary in the  UK continued to experience some slowdown while  the broader insurance vertical also remained weak.
Our investment in Japan is yet to pick up momentum.
Your Company’s talent development initiatives  continued to support business growth.
At the end of  FY16, TCS had a diverse base of 3,53, 843 employees in  55 countries from 129 nationalities including  33.8 per cent women professionals.
We continued to  enjoy the highest retention in the industry at 14.7 per  08 I TCS Annual Report 2015-16 TCS Annual Report 2015-16 I 09 cent LTM (last 12 months) for IT professionals.
Our  employee engagement programs like Fit4Life,  Purpose4Life and SafetyFirst are helping create  awareness about health and fitness as well as enabling  our employees to engage with the community to make a  positive impact.
It is the commitment and dedication of these TCSers  across the world that has helped your Company perform  on a sustained basis.
On behalf of all the shareholders,  I would like to thank every TCSer for their drive and  passion that has helped this organisation maintain its  growth and momentum.
Today, customers see your Company as a partner of  choice for their transformation initiatives.
This is evident  from the strength of the customer revenue metrics  which have shown exceptional improvement in FY16.
We added eight new customers in the $100+ million  band taking the total to 37 customers, while  37 new customers were added in the $10+ million  band totalling 298 customers.
Our customer  satisfaction scores also reached an all-time high,  reflecting this trend.
Digital Technology Trends Demand for our services i s being driven by the  acceleration in the adoption of Digital.
Digital is creating  new opportunities for enterprises to drive Efficiency and  Simplification across the business.
Most brick and  mortar businesses were built in a pre-digital era.
Therefore, to thrive in the Digital economy, enterprises  are on a quest to deliver unique customer experiences,  gain real-time access to insights, improve workforce  productivity and create a hyper-connected eco-system.
The impact of “Digital Technologies” has further  intensified in the past twelve months.
We are living in a  digital age, characterised by an accelerating trend of  hyper-connectivity between humans and also between  humans and smart devices.
As you go through this  annual report, we have attempted to showcase some of  the key technology and business trends that are shaping  the future of TCS and that of our customers.
The digital world we inhabit today has very different  characteristics from what we have seen in the past.
It is forcing all of us - individuals, enterprises and  governments - to learn new ways to engage with  our stakeholders.
In addition, widespread adoption of  Digital technologies by business is leading to the  evolution of the Smart Enterprise – companies that can  respond in real time and provide unique personalised  experiences for its customers.
Smart Enterprises are quick to recognise that in a Digital  world, experience supercedes features.
This was not  the case even five years ago, when we would buy a  product based on its features alone without even  opening the box!
But now it’s the experience of  the product or service that determines our buying  behaviour.
The reason we focus on experience today is  because new features are only one software release  away.
Whatever the product, be it a smart watch or  even a car, every software release brings new and  enriched features.
For a Smart Enterprise to respond in real-time or ahead  of time requires dematerialisation of an enterprise  where physical assets now have a Digital interface.
Once dematerialised, all enterprise’s assets -  technology, infrastructure, operations, logistics,  customer data and content - become software driven  and therefore now available for seamless correlation  and deriving proactive insights.
For example, as goods  from cars to cans become more ‘intelligent’,  a dematerialised smart enterprise can execute,  respond, plan and predict in real-time using insights  gleaned from big data.
To succeed, Smart Enterprises have to be Agile by  default.
Agility is the ability of an enterprise to move with  speed and respond to changes in its environment swiftly  (for example, when launching new products).
Your Company is proactively increasing its use of  Agile/ DevOps (Development + Operations)  methodologies to radically decrease the time to market  of new solutions, while bringing about greater  collaboration between IT and business.
Further, to make sense of voluminous and unstructured  data that is increasing exponentially, Smart Enterprises  are using Artificial Intelligence technologies for  developing machine learning and deep learning  capabilities.
Software robots are playing a bigger role in  our lives – from algorithmic trading and advisory  services in financial markets to mapbots which give us  daily driving directions.
Additionally, cloud-based  models are enabling ‘anywhere-anytime-any device’  access to data which is creating a significant shift in  business models and enterprise IT architectures.
TCS Leadership in the Digital Economy Your Company has been at the forefront of this  Digital revolution by making strategic investments  across multiple dimensions ahead of time to ensure that  we are well equipped to capture this big opportunity.
Today, we are Digital partners for 52% of our  3,50,000+ Our rich customer base, domain expertise and  deep understanding of the customer landscape,  technology investments and IP combined with  our global scale puts us in pole position to make  a significant impact in the Digital world.

Letter from the CEO “  ”  customers across multiple segments such as Mobility  and Pervasive Computing, Cloud, Big Data,  Artificial Intelligence & Robotics – all of which have  grown at a compounded quarterly growth rate of 8-12  per cent during FY16.
We have built the right technology  talent combined with deep domain expertise and an  understanding of the customer’s business.
The Digital economy and disruptions in technologies are  changing the skills requirements in our industry.
Recognising the need to build the right Digital talent,  your Company has made significant investments to  upgrade skills of its employees as well as increase its  focus on hiring specialised talent.
TCS has created a world-class Digital Learning Platform -  an integrated ecosystem that combines virtual,  physical and experiential learning with high quality  content that is available anywhere, anyplace, anytime  and on any device.
I am delighted to share that we have  trained over 1,20,000 TCSers in multiple digital  technologies during FY16.
Digital transformations entail new ways of collaboration  among teams that consist of players with multiple niche  skills – from design to psychology – in order to deliver a  ‘customer-first’ experience.
Towards this, we have  invested in a new Design Studio in Silicon V alley,  staffed with top notch professionals with diverse skill  sets.
It is a collaborative space where customers can  co-create with TCS in a typical start-up ‘garage’  environment.
A new executive briefing centre was also  launched for next-generation engagement with  customers using immersive technologies in Mumbai.
Your Company’s significant investments in Digital has  resulted in a growing portfolio of Digital products and  TM platforms.
TCS’ strategic bets in TCS Bancs  for  TM Financial Services and iON  for the Education sector  have performed well.
We also continue to invest in  digital platform solutions for key industries, horizontal  functions (Account Payable, HR) as well as technology  assets.
The new cloud platforms together delivered  $172 million in revenues in FY16, a growth of 37 per cent  year on year.
TM In June last year, we launched ignio , our flagship  automation product for enterprise IT that helps  customers analyse, plan and predict their IT needs.
TM With its cognitive capabilities, ignio  is technologically  an advanced enterprise automation product in the  market.
Within nine months of its launch it had signed up  TM 16 customers.
TCS has also filed 24 patents for ignio   till date.
Today’s digital enterprises also face an increased  exposure to cyber security threats from phishing  attacks, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and  hyper-connected universe, data confidentiality and data  sensitivity.
TCS has taken proactive steps to combat  these threats and ensure uninterrupted service delivery  to customers.
We also continue to reinforce our  stringent security policies and procedures.
Driving Research & Innovation  Your Company has been pursuing a two-pronged  Research and Innovation (R&I) agenda.
Our in-house R&I  programs have been refined to focus on foundational  research in areas like deep learning, nano-materials,  cognitive computing and genomics as well as engage in  industry-centric innovations like the use of blockchain  technology in banking, connected cars or smart homes.
Your Company remains focused on Intellectual Property  creation.
At the end of FY16, the company has applied  for 2,842 patents cumulatively, including 565 applied  during the past 12 months, of which the company has  been granted 341 patents.
However, as an organisation we are humble enough to  recognise that it is impossible to innovate in isolation.
Therefore, to complement the in-house R&I efforts,  your Company has built a global start-up partnership  TM ecosystem called COIN  (Co-Innovation Network)  which actively engages with technology start-ups,  academia and venture capitalists to identify innovative  ideas on an ongoing basis from over 1,400 companies on  our radar.
Additionally we continue to build our strategic academic  partnerships.
In FY16 your Company made a  US$35 million gift to Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon  University, which was the all-time largest corporate gift  to the university and the largest gift from outside the  U.S.
This donation will fund a new 40,000 square feet  facility, the TCS Building, which will support education,  cutting-edge research and house state-of-the-art  facilities.
In India, your Company also announced plans  to set up the FC Kohli Center on Intelligent Systems at  IIIT Hyderabad which will coordinate research in related  domains across different centres of the university.
In March, in collaboration with Nashik city and  MIT Media Labs, your Company began a unique social  innovation program.
The TCS Digital Impact Square is an  open Social Innovation Platform to address real life  challenges by engaging with students and  entrepreneurs from across India and providing them  with internships to build solutions to challenging social  issues using Digital technologies and human centric  design principles.
Beyond Business: Key Social Initiatives Your Company made a significant impact in the  community with new programs and initiatives.
TCS stepped forward to extend its support towards the  ‘Swachh Bharat, Swachh Vidyalaya’ initiative,  announced by India’s Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  on August 15, 2014.
As the largest corporate  contributor to the program, your Company has built  dedicated toilets for girl students in 1,472 schools in  Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar and Tamil Nadu,  changing lives of over 80,000 students in the process by  giving them the opportunity to live a healthy childhood  and gain an education.
Another landmark initiative was the social  transformation of All India Institute of Medical Sciences  – India’s pre-eminent public healthcare institution  - where using process re-engineering and technology, a TCS team worked tirelessly for six months to  re-engineer and deploy new processes to reduce  waiting times by 66 per cent to less than two hours  benefitting over three million patients annually.
The TCS STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering,  Math) program expanded its reach, inspiring young  minds.
It is designed to empower students to master  digital technologies through innovative technology  learning platforms.
TCS contributed to US2020 program  to launch a new online platform which aims to connect  more STEM professionals to grassroots volunteering  opportunities, acknowledged by the US White House in  a press statement.
Your Company will continue to look for ways to make  significant social interventions using digital platforms  and technologies in the areas of health and education  going forward.
Last but not least, I am delighted to share that your  Company has been recognised and rewarded by peers  and stakeholders.
TCS was rated as the world’s most  powerful brand in IT Services and also retained its  position as the fastest growing brand within its industry  over the last 6 years.
Among other major accolades,  TCS ranked number 1 in Europe for Customer  Satisfaction by Whitelane Research for third year in a  row.
Your Company also appeared in the global Forbes  100 most innovative global companies list for the  eighth consecutive year and topped the Business Today  500 list for the third year in a row.
Looking ahead, as global businesses aspire to become  Smart Enterprises by accelerating adoption of digital,  your Company is very well positioned in this regard.
Our rich customer base, domain expertise and deep  understanding of the customer landscape, technology  investments and IP combined with our global scale puts  us in pole position to make a significant impact in the  Digital world.
I would like to thank shareholders for all their support and  encouragement during the year.

The next wave of Omni-channel Retailing is focused on Retailer’s ability  to deliver superior customer experience and instantly deliver on Customer promise every single time.
Imagine, a large  retailer with 200 million customers, fulfilling 1,50,000+ orders per day- of which 40% are omnichannel (anytime,  anywhere orders).
It requires the retailer to effectively manage and supply its 2 million Stock Keeping units (SKUs) across  5,000 inventory nodes to fulfil customer orders in <30 minutes.
Tough?

The slow growth in advanced economies, changing nature of emerging markets, Central bank trials with monetary  policies and increasing vigilance by Regulators continue to challenge growth in Financial Service firms.
Further,  technology continues to lower the barriers for entry and has given rise to Fintech companies that are offering  payment solutions, peer-to-peer services and even advisory services.
The Banks are investing significantly in  technology (aka Digital is Default) to managing this volatility, to address experience gaps, to pursue newer sources  of revenue and to improve operational efficiency and agility.

TCS has created a  Robo Advisory solution that offers automated, sophisticated,  personalized and adaptive investment advice.
Based on the risk  preferences and the performance of the recommended portfolio,  the Robo Advisor would adapt the advice.
This solution has helped banks  in attracting new customers to their fold.
Insurance companies have tried to install telematics devices in their  consumers’ vehicles but haven’t found favour.
TCS has reimagined the  scenario by leveraging the ubiquitous smartphone.
We developed a  comprehensive solution – using the distributed power of smartphone -  that captures telematics data on speed, braking, lane changes to  understand driving behaviour and the quality of driving.
This helped the  insurer in having a high quality engagement with customers and in  reducing premiums by 14% for better drivers.
Banks continue to face a dynamic regulatory environment.
They need a  single source of truth to make compliance efficient.
TCS developed the  World’s largest cloud cluster (500+ Nodes) to help one of its customers  to simplify its Information flows for an accelerated data quality compliance  and a significant improvement in data governance.
The Bank is, now,  successfully using this for reaping the benefits through a single view of  customer and improved Fraud Detection.
Banks have the customers but need to continuously adapt to newer  experiences being provided by other industries (including Social).
TCS helped DNB, the largest financial services group in Norway, launch  Vipps, a peer-to-peer mobile payments application.
Vipps makes money  transfers as easy as sending an SMS.
While shaping the peer-to-peer  money movement market, Vipps has become the #1 downloaded App in  Norway.
Approximately 25% of Norway’s population uses ‘Vipps’, and  85% of Norwegians know about it.

Engineers are the new doctors!
With Digital technologies, it is possible to accelerate drug discovery, develop  personalised medicine and craft personalised medical implants.
This is improving patient outcomes in significant ways  and improving their quality of life.
Shaping the Future of Life Sciences Using TCS IP , Advanced Drug Development (ADD) platform,  pharmaceutical companies are boosting R&D productivity.
One of our  customers was able to realize multi million dollar savings by carrying out  35+ Studies in just 2 years, supporting 4,300+ study sites & 21,000+  patients.
Customer plans to onboard many more studies by this year-end.
Knee implants can improve quality of life but they can be very painful with  long recovery times for patients.
TCS' expertise in Digital technologies  creates personalised cutting blocks for knee implants that result in 19%  less operative time, 31% less blood loss, and more than 26% reduction in  patient recovery time.
More than 70,000 patients have benefited from  these personalized surgeries.
Even today we do not understand the genetics of most inherited, rare  disorders.
Diagnosis of rare and potentially fatal disorders at birth remains a  pressing need.
Using genome sequencing the TCS GeMS (Genomics and  Metagenomics) platform has been used to successfully diagnose the  genetic causes of various immune and metabolic disorders.
Disorders such  as Ataxia, SCID, Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome, PKU and novel autoimmune  disorders have been diagnosed using the platform helping clinicians treat  patients more effectively.

Similarly, for board examinations, the iON platform has resulted in 40%  reduction in evaluation process time for the three million answer books  evaluated as on date with total elimination of transporting physical answer  books with 99.99% reduction in re-evaluation requests.
TCS has changed the way consumers use mobile payment systems with its  mWallet offering implemented with major telecom providers in India.
mWallet provides customers with a new form of currency powered from  their mobile phones.
With millions of customers and a network of over  1,00,000 agents, spread across urban and rural India, mWallet platforms  have successfully exploited mobile penetration to provide basic banking  services on the mobile.
Distribution of wages, government benefits, enabling  e-commerce and many more new transactions on mWallet are truly making  mobile the new bank account.
Consumers are increasingly choosing Digital channels including mobile to buy and consume the products and services they need.
This also applies to the way citizens today want to access public services.
India has the potential to leapfrog most societies in its  use of technology to drive development and growth by using social and technology-based platforms in order to leverage the new  digital infrastructure that is rapidly being built and deployed across the country.
India today boasts of over a billion mobile  connections and its netizens are among the largest user bases on global social platforms.
The Indian government is driving the ‘Digital India’ agenda through multiple policies and initiatives – leveraging the Aadhar card to  promote cashless transfers to beneficiaries; incentivising the creation of new Smart Cities, or facilitating mobile payments by  licensing new ‘payments-only’ banks.
There are multiple initiatives taking place across different strata of the economy and TCS is  proud to play a role in many of these facets.
Financial Inclusion: Consider policies that have enabled 450 million new  ‘nofrills’ bank accounts to be opened by banks including 216 million through  the Prime Minister’s Jana Dhan Yojana scheme alone.
TCS has been playing a  significant part in enabling this vision.
TCS platforms and software support  113 million accounts in 102 banks through cost-effective technology delivery  models such as Bank-in-Box-on-Cloud, mobility in service delivery, financial  gateway to ensure integration, interoperability, transaction and integrity and  the remote control of field operations.
TCS’ impact does not end there.
Over 140 rural banks under NABARD use the  TCS cloud platform to reach and service over 54 million customers.
In addition, India’s largest bank, State Bank of India, which runs on  TM TCS BaNCS  , now has over 500 million accounts of 1.1 billion accounts in  the country.
Digital Assessment: India is among the largest markets for examinations  and assessments in the world.
TCS has been playing a significant part in  disrupting the higher education sector to bring in transparency, speed and  high quality of assessments and examination.

As the largest corporate contributor to the Prime Minister’s “Swachh Bharat, Swachh Vidyalaya” movement,  TCS is providing girls an opportunity to shine by giving them a healthy childhood.
A childhood that is free of unhygienic sanitary conditions so that these young,  bright students can focus on their academics rather than worry about falling ill. As 47% of schools in India don't have a separate girl’s toilet this leads to  a less than conducive learning environment.
TCS analysed the problem and found a holistic solution taking into account infrastructure, maintenance and education.
The solution was not only  implementable, but also sustainable while at the same time raising awareness about hygiene.
Covering four states in India, TCS has changed the lives of over  80,000 students in over 1,400 schools and has given many girls the opportunity to strive for a better life.

A Macro view In 2015, global economic activity remained subdued,  with world output slowing down further to 3.1% 1.
Emerging markets and developing economies grew 4%, a   year-on-year deceleration for the ﬁfth consecutive year.
Steep falls in oil prices, continued weakness in commodity  prices, a slowdown in China and deep recessions in some  large emerging market economies more than offset  strong growth in India and some of the ASEAN economies.
Developed economies which are key markets for  information technology (IT) services grew a modest  1.9% in aggregate – US (2.4%), UK (2.2%), Euro Area  (1.6%) and Japan (0.5%), hampered by weak demand,  unfavorable demographics and low productivity growth.
This was the weak macroeconomic backdrop against  which large global corporations sought to become  efﬁcient even as they used technology to fend off business  model challenges, establish competitive differentiation,  show revenue & earnings growth and stay compliant in a  shifting regulatory landscape.
2.
Overview of the industry The global market for outsourced IT – business process  management (BPM) services grew a mere 0.4% over  the prior year to $1.2 trillion.
Within this, IT services  registered a small decline of 0.2% year-on-year while  package implementation grew 0.2% over the prior year  and BPM grew 3% over the prior year.
Sharp cross-currency movements during the year  diminished the non-dollar denominated components of  the global market when reported in USD.
In terms of the drivers of growth, the relentless quest  for efﬁciency continued in ﬁscal 2016, with management  teams taking a more strategic approach to structural cost  take out.
Digital technology adoption progressed apace,  with early projects delivering better than anticipated  outcomes and resulting in larger and more ambitious  digital re-imagination programmes taking wing.
Some industries saw additional spending triggered by  regulatory compliance activities.
3.
Our business TCS is an information technology services, consulting  and business solutions company, servicing large global  corporations across a range of industry verticals including  banking, ﬁnancial services & insurance, retail & consumer  packaged goods (CPG), telecom, media & entertainment,  manufacturing, hi-tech, life sciences & healthcare, energy,  1 http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2016/NEW041216A.htm resources & utilities, travel, transportation & hospitality  and government sectors.
The Company’s expertise in traditional and new age  technologies extends across its full services portfolio  of consulting and enterprise solutions, application  development & maintenance, assurance services,  engineering & industrial services, IT infrastructure  services, business process services and asset leveraged  solutions.
These services are delivered through its unique global  network delivery model (GNDM™), recognised as the  benchmark of excellence in software development.
With  over 353,000 employees and a global delivery footprint  that covers over 145 solution centers, TCS is amongst the  world’s top 10 IT service-providers.
TCS’ focus on execution excellence, its scale, domain  expertise and its array of intellectual property have  been recognised by customers, giving the Company  tremendous traction in the various markets it operates  in.
The Company’s compounded annual growth rate  (CAGR) since ﬁscal 2007 is 21.6%, with industry-leading  operating margins.
4.
Strategy The Company’s strategy for longer term growth has  been to (a) continually expand its addressable market  by investing in newer geographies, newer industry  verticals and newer service lines and (b) strengthen and  deepen existing client relationships through a customer- centric approach, superior execution that gives clients an  experience of certainty, a full services capability and a  scalable global network delivery model (GNDMTM).
The ﬁrst element of strategy has resulted in a de-risked  business portfolio that is broadly diversiﬁed across all  three dimensions: geography, industry verticals and  service lines, lending the business substantial resiliency  from local or sectoral business cycle volatility.
Details have  been provided in discussion on revenue.
The second element of strategy has resulted in very large,  deep and enduring relationships with some of the world’s  largest corporations.
Success in this area is measured by  looking at the number of customers in each revenue  bucket and how they progress up the revenue buckets  with time.
In ﬁscal 2016, the Company added 8 more  clients in the $100 million+ revenue band, bringing the  total to 37 and in the $10 million+ revenue band, the  Company added 37 clients this year, bringing the total  to 298.

Digital technologies TCS has been one of the earliest technology players to  explicitly call out the deep impact that the digital forces  would have on enterprises, consumers, governments and  on societies.
As enterprises dematerialised their assets  and got hyper-connected, operations became more  software-driven and generated masses of real time data  which could be mined for actionable insights.
Our Digital Reimagination™ framework provided a  holistic roadmap for our customers to bring to bear  the power of these new technologies while reinventing  their business models, products and services, channels,  customer segments, business processes and workplaces.
In ﬁscal 2016, digital adoption continued apace and the  Company’s participation in customers’ digital spending  grew substantially.
With the scale and scope of digital  programmes increasing beyond the pure front-end space  and pervading the rest of the underlying application  stack, our scale and digital capability position us very  strongly to become the preferred digital partner for  more and more clients.
Over half of our customers, spanning across every single  industry vertical, have engaged TCS to partner them in  their digital journey.
Revenues from digital engagements  constituted 13.8% of the Company’s revenues in ﬁscal  2016, while in absolute terms, the digital revenues grew  by 52.2% in constant currency over ﬁscal 2015.
This substantial traction has been made possible by  sustained, proactive investments made by TCS over the  last several years across multiple areas so that when  customers were ready to ramp up their investments in this  exciting new space, the Company was more than ready  to fulﬁll their requirements.
Some of the investments are  detailed in the following sections.
5.1  Talent development in digital space The Company’s early lead in digital came on account of  proactively scaling up the digital talent pool within the  organisation.
In addition to expanding the Company’s  hiring programme to cover a broader spectrum of diverse  skills, TCS is also investing heavily in a scalable programme  to re-skill the workforce and endow employees with  skills – soft skills, design skills, multi-technology skills  and domain skills - that are critical to stay relevant in the  digital era.
At the center of this new approach is TCS’ digital learning  platform - an integrated ecosystem that combines virtual,  physical and experiential learning infrastructure with  high quality content and available any place, any time  and on any device.
The platform offers courses on a multitude of different  digital tools, platforms and skill-sets, and allows  individuals to pick what they want to learn, learn it the  way they want to, and to the extent or depth that they  require for a particular role.
From a ‘push’ model of training, the Company has moved  to an employee-centric ‘pull’ model, which is more in line  with the demands of the digital era and also the millennial  mindset.
Employee feedback has been very positive and  the outcomes have far exceeded expectations.
In ﬁscal  2016, the Company has been able to impart over 349,000  competencies to over 120,000 employees.
5.2  Next-generation delivery model One of TCS’ operational innovations of the last decade,  which served as a very powerful differentiator was the  GNDM™, characterised by a global, interconnected  workforce, integrated processes and a robust, multi- tiered collaboration and communication infrastructure.
The GNDM™ fostered collaboration among globally  distributed teams and the leveraging of common assets  to seamlessly deliver consistently high service levels to  customers, regardless of which part of the globe they  chose to engage with TCS.
Today, the Company’s global delivery footprint covers  over 145 solution centers across 19 countries, and it is  now almost routine for our large customers to be serviced  by globally distributed teams located out of a dozen or  more delivery locations.
In the digital era, where customers are looking to TCS  to help leverage new technologies to transform their  businesses and gain competitive advantage, speed is of  the essence, and agility is key.
Consequently, new projects  use ‘Agile’ or ‘DevOps’ by default.
The Company has invested in building collaborative  workspaces at its delivery centers to facilitate a very  different style of working that Agile / DevOps entails and  ﬁne-tuned its delivery processes and controls.
There is  now a large and growing body of case studies of large,  globally distributed programmes successfully using our  GNDM™ to leverage Agile / DevOps.
Management Discussion and Analysis70  Annual Report 2015-16 5.3  Innovation The Company’s success in emerging as the preferred  transformational partner to some of the largest  corporations has been on account of the highly innovative  industry-speciﬁc solutions that we have proactively  developed and showcased to our clients and prospects at  our various innovation centers across the world, as well  as at ‘innovation days’ organised with key customers and  ‘innovation forum’ organised in key markets such as USA,  UK and Australia.
These solutions were built through a close collaboration  between domain experts within each of the industry  solution units, technology experts and researchers from  our R&D group.
In addition to industry-focused efforts,  there are several cross-unit innovation programmes  working on building solutions to address real-time  compliance for the enterprise, real-time agile enterprise,  global data marketplaces and applications of blockchain  technologies.
Software research focused on formal methods in  veriﬁcation & validation, design thinking, service design  tools and creation of enterprise models for agile business  operations.
Several projects within the applications  research area found successful pilot implementations  among TCS customers including email analytics for  problem resolution, service desk automation and   image / video based auto part inspection.
Other areas of focus for the R&D team during the year  were integrated computational materials engineering,  high performance computing, application programme  interface (API) centric development, ﬂexible supply  chains and robotics.
TCS’ researchers also worked on  cyber-physical systems focused on health sensing, drone  based services, augmented & virtual reality, data privacy  and security.

ADM continues to be the major contributor although  its relative weight to the total revenue has come down  over the past years (39.86% in ﬁscal 2016, 52.20% in  ﬁscal 2007) in line with our strategy of focusing on new  services.
Consequently, contribution from other services  to total revenue has increased.
Management Discussion and Analysis 81  Employee costs and BA related expenses Employee costs include salaries which have ﬁxed and variable components, contribution to retirement funds and  pension schemes.
It also includes expenses incurred on staff welfare.
Overseas business expenses primarily comprise living allowances paid to employees on overseas assignments.

There is a decrease of  0.48% in EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, primarily  attributable to increase in employee and BA related  expenses.
Other income (net) Other income decreased from ` 3,229.91 crores in ﬁscal  2015 to ` 3,053.87 crores in ﬁscal 2016 primarily due to  decrease in exchange gain (net) from ` 1,308.47 crores  in ﬁscal 2015 to ` 743.26 crores in ﬁscal 2016, partially  offset by (1) increase in proﬁt on redemption of mutual  funds, sale of government securities & other investments  (net), from ` 233.10 crores in ﬁscal 2015 to ` 471.89  crores in ﬁscal 2016 and (2) increase in interest income  on bank deposits, inter-corporate deposits and bonds  & debentures from ` 1,596.61 crores in ﬁscal 2015 to   ` 1,715.53 crores in ﬁscal 2016 arising out of effective  treasury management.
Foreign exchange forward, option and futures  contracts TCS enters into foreign exchange forward, option and  futures contracts to manage its exposure to exchange  rate ﬂuctuations, in accordance with its risk management  policies.
TCS follows accounting principles in line with international  ﬁnancial reporting standard 9 (IFRS 9) to account for the  aforesaid hedging instruments.
Changes in the fair value  of instruments designated as hedges of future cash ﬂows  are recognised directly in shareholders’ funds if they are  effective in hedging the risk.
The ineffective portion is  recognised immediately in the statement of proﬁt and  loss.
The change in the time value as well as the intrinsic  value of option is accumulated in hedging reserve and  is classiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss when the  forecasted transaction occurs.
Foreign exchange forward, option and futures contracts  outstanding at the reporting dates, other than designated  cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at their respective fair values  Management Discussion and Analysis82  Annual Report 2015-16 and the resultant gains or losses are accounted as ‘other  income (net)’ in the proﬁt and loss account for the period.

The increase was spread across all asset groups, mainly  attributable to freehold buildings, electrical installations,  furniture and ﬁxtures, computers, leasehold improvement  and plant & machinery.
In relation to revenue, this group  of expenses decreased from 1.90% in ﬁscal 2015 to 1.79%  in ﬁscal 2016.
Exceptional item In ﬁscal 2016 there has been no item which can be  termed as “exceptional”.
In ﬁscal 2015, there was a   one-time credit item of ` 489.75 crores shown under the  head ‘Exceptional item’, representing the net impact of  change in accounting policy for depreciation necessitated  due to implementation of the Companies Act, 2013.
Proﬁt before tax (PBT) In ﬁscal 2016, PBT was ` 31,675.87 crores ( ` 28,926.40   crores in ﬁscal 2015 ex rewards).
As a percentage of  revenue, PBT decreased from 30.56% in ﬁscal 2015 to  29.16% in ﬁscal 2016.
The decrease of 1.40% in ﬁscal 2016  is mainly due to (1) decrease in EBITDA of 0.48%, (2) other  income by 0.60% and (3) the absence of the exceptional  item which had contributed 0.52% to revenue in ﬁscal  2015.
Tax expense Tax expense increased to ` 7,300.93 crores in ﬁscal 2016  from ` 6,238.79 crores as reported in ﬁscal 2015.

Minority interest Minority interest registered a decrease from ` 214.52  crores in ﬁscal 2015 to ` 83.12 crores in ﬁscal 2016,   primarily due to the amalgamation of a subsidiary,  CMC Limited, with the Company.
As a result of the  amalgamation, the Company issued 1,16,99,962 equity  shares to the shareholders of CMC Limited thereby  extinguishing the minority interest held in CMC Limited.
Proﬁt after tax (PAT) The net proﬁt in ﬁscal 2016 was ` 24,291.82 crores  (22.36% of revenue) as compared to ` 21,911.85 crores in  ﬁscal 2015 ex rewards (23.15% of revenue).
The decrease  of 0.79% in terms of revenue is primarily attributable to  decrease in PBT.

Management Discussion and Analysis 83  Banking, ﬁnancial services and insurance (BFSI) The BFSI industry segment is witnessing an increased  spend on strategic initiatives like automation, digitisation  and simpliﬁcation.
Digitisation is now the default strategy  for banks.
Increasingly vigilant regulators have ensured  that governance, risk management and compliance (GRC)  continue to demand an increased attention by banks.
The digital revolution is redrawing the boundaries of  ﬁnancial services and lowering entry barriers encouraging  challengers to emerge.
Openings are being created for  focused, fast-moving competitors.
As a response, banks  are renewing their focus on innovation in product  creation, bundling, distribution & servicing.
The key  themes of innovation revolve around data, customer  experience, artiﬁcial intelligence, APIs, blockchain, etc.
Financial institutions are designing competition models  and ecosystem tenets to tackle the dynamic environment  to maintain their distinct identity and stay relevant for  the future.
The Company has invested in a broad array of offerings  in the areas of analytics, biometrics, blockchain, etc.
It is  collaborating with ‘ﬁntech’ ﬁrms working in niche areas  and looking at joint go-to-market opportunities.
In ﬁscal 2016, the insurance industry continued to  experience a soft market.
Insurers have been trying to  improve proﬁts through underwriting, expense reduction  and tighter scrutiny of capital investments because of  poor investment yields and rate declines across most  insurance lines of business.
Increased competition and  disruption from new players in the industry continue to  impact rate and customer retention.
Stricter regulatory  requirements in North America, UK and Europe add  pressure to the industry as a whole.
These trends and  market conditions are forcing insurers to change their  existing business models and operate more efﬁciently.
The industry is under pressure to transform.
The Company has invested in business transformation  through digital innovation, application & infrastructure  modernisation and risk management.
It continues to  develop digital technology-based solutions that are  targeted towards delivering beneﬁts across the insurance  value chain.
It has continued to grow its digital inﬂuence,  and has expanded its footprint through new clients in  Europe and North America.
In ﬁscal 2016, BFSI constituted 40.65% of Company’s  revenue (40.74% in ﬁscal 2015), growing at 14.51%  (9.83% in ﬁscal 2015).
Telecom, media and entertainment As a group, telecom, media & entertainment witnessed  revenue growth of 8.42 % in ﬁscal 2016 (13.73% in ﬁscal  2015).
Communications industry ﬁrms which have stayed with  their traditional lines of business have seen erosion in  their subscriber base and drop in margins due to entry  of new media and new technology ﬁrms such as Skype,  WhatsApp, and Google that piggyback unrestricted on  telecom infrastructure.
Telecom operators are trying to  avoid becoming just simple data channels in the digital  era where the value is increasingly shifting to digital  content from infrastructure provisioning.
Novelty around  non-traditional business models like mobile payments,  IoT applications brought new opportunities for the  telecom industry.
Media industry ﬁrms have seen an acceleration in the shift  of their business from traditional to digital during the  year.
Shrinking newspaper and magazine subscriptions,  stagnant publishing and information services resulted in  missed growth targets by entertainment and broadcast  ﬁrms.
Entry of born digital ﬁrms such as Facebook and  Google took the business away from traditional ﬁrms.
The industry ﬁrms are therefore under pressure to reduce  their cost base, including IT costs, and accelerate their  transformation to digital.
Overall the media industry  grew slower than what was forecast earlier with the  shift to digital taking away traditional revenues at a pace  faster than substitution by digital growth for many ﬁrms.
Mergers and acquisitions have gathered pace as a  way of consolidation and capturing value from other  growing parts of the value chain.
What started with  Comcast and NBCU accelerated with other consolidation  such as Verizon - AOL, IBM - The Weather Channel,  AT&T - Quickplay, Amazon Web Services - Elemental  Technologies, Ericcsson – Envivo, Comscore – Rentrack  and NewsCorp - Digital First Media.
The communications  and media ﬁrms interplay is likely to continue through  2016 and beyond.
Fundamental enablers for the overall growth of  communications and media industries all point in the right  direction.
Proliferation of mobile devices, exponential  growth in both content creation and consumption,  high growth rate in particular of video consumption,  proliferation of IoT to multiple sectors of all industries  and a continued growth in broadband connectivity will  continue to drive the industry momentum.
We are likely to see growth in over the top video,  innovations such as blockchain, software deﬁned  networks and network function virtualization becoming  more mainstream in 2016.
Enterprise IT functions will  continue to strive for efﬁciency whereas digital products  and services will aim for time to market drivers.
Cloud  will gain momentum with the inhibitions around security  giving way rapidly as ﬁrms realize that their enterprise  data centers are no more secure than the cloud.
The Company’s rich industry experience and domain  expertise enables it to deliver a suite of offerings which  addresses the industry’s demand on digital products,  service quality management, expansion of core capabilities  into adjacencies, process automation, data monetisation,  network management and implementation of next  generation technologies.
The Company’s key digital  platforms such as Hosted OSS/BSS (HOBS), ‘Customer  Management Discussion and Analysis84  Annual Report 2015-16 Intelligence and Insights’ (CI&I) gained increased customer  adoption in the ﬁscal 2016.
The Company has invested in  building “Fit for Purpose” platforms and solutions which  have enabled multiple service providers and enterprises  across the globe to simplify their business, diversify and  grow in emerging areas.
Retail and CPG The retail segment was one of the fastest growing  industry verticals in the global market for outsourced IT  services.
Retailer’s IT spend is largely driven by their need to deliver  a uniﬁed, personalised and frictionless experience.
To  enable this, there is focus on creating real time, agile  and simpliﬁed enterprises powered by the digital forces.
Micro-services based architecture, big data analytics,  cloud, IoT, virtual reality, artiﬁcial intelligence and  machine learning cognitive computing, are some of the  key levers that will be employed by retailers to deliver the  interconnected customer journey.
The focus on security  and data privacy continues to be paramount.
To support the above initiatives of retail clients,  the Company is investing signiﬁcantly in building  differentiated products, solutions and offerings.
It  has developed ﬁrst-of-its kind, micro services enabled  uniﬁed store commerce platform ‘OmnistoreTM’, digital  merchandising suite ‘Optumera TM’ and ‘Omnistock TM’  for omni-channel supply chain.

Short-term and long-term borrowings  The decrease in short term borrowings (` 112.96 crores as  at March 31, 2016; ` 185.56 crores as at March 31, 2015)  was mainly attributable to the reduction of ` 184.40  crores in unsecured bank overdraft, offset by increase in  secured bank overdraft of ` 111.80 crores required for  management of working capital.
The secured loans are  secured against book debts.
Long-term borrowings as at March 31, 2016 aggregated  ` 50.06 crores ( ` 64.71 crores as at March 31, 2015)  primarily due to ﬁnance lease obligations of ` 49.77 crores   (` 64.13 crores as at March 31, 2015) which are secured  against ﬁxed assets.

Note 6  to the unconsolidated ﬁnancial statements brings out  details of component-wise deferred tax balances where  the net values result into liabilities or assets, jurisdiction- wise.
Deferred tax liability or asset is recognised on timing  difference being the difference between taxable income  and accounting income that originate in one period and  is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Such timing differences resulting in deferred tax liability  or asset usually arise from items like branch proﬁt tax,  depreciation and employee beneﬁt expenses.
The net deferred tax liability was ` 365.52 crores as at  March 31, 2016 (` 271.46 crores as at March 31, 2015).

INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR  ADEQUACY TCS has aligned its current systems of internal ﬁnancial  control with the requirement of Companies Act 2013,  on lines of globally accepted risk based framework as  issued by the committee of sponsoring organisations  (COSO) of the treadway commission.
The Internal  Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is  intended to increase transparency and accountability in  an organisation’s process of designing and implementing  a system of internal control.
The framework requires  a company to identify and analyse risks and manage  appropriate responses.
The Company has successfully laid  down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.
TCS’s internal controls are commensurate with its size and  the nature of its operations.
These have been designed  to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording  and providing reliable ﬁnancial and operational  information, complying with applicable statutes,  safeguarding assets from unauthorised use, executing  transactions with proper authorisation and ensuring  compliance of corporate policies.
TCS has a well-deﬁned  delegation of power with authority limits for approving  revenue as well as expenditure.
Processes for formulating  and reviewing annual and long term business plans have  been laid down.
TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise  resource planning (ERP) system to record data for  accounting, consolidation and management information  purposes and connects to different locations for efﬁcient  exchange of information.
It has continued its efforts  to align all its processes and controls with global best  practices.
Management Discussion and Analysis104  Annual Report 2015-16 Our management assessed the effectiveness of the  Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (as  deﬁned in Clause 17 of SEBI Regulations 2015) as of  March 31, 2016.
The assessment involved self review, peer  review and external audit.
Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, the statutory auditors of  TCS has audited the ﬁnancial statements included in this  annual report and has issued an attestation report on our  internal control over ﬁnancial reporting (as deﬁned in  section 143 of Companies Act 2013).
TCS has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to oversee and  carry out internal audit of its activities.
The audit is based  on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year  in consultation with the statutory auditors (Deloitte  Haskins & Sells LLP) and the audit committee.
In line with  international practice, the conduct of internal audit is  oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks  in its operations such as software delivery, accounting and  ﬁnance, procurement, employee engagement, travel,  insurance, IT processes, including most of the subsidiaries  and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialised third  party consultants and professional for business speciﬁc  compliances such as quality management, service  management, information security, etc.
The audit committee reviews reports submitted by the  management and audit reports submitted by internal  auditors and statutory auditors.
Suggestions for  improvement are considered and the audit committee  follows up on corrective action.
The audit committee  also meets TCS’ statutory auditors to ascertain, inter alia,  their views on the adequacy of internal control systems  and keeps the board of directors informed of its major  observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation (as deﬁned in section 177 of  Companies Act 2013 and Clause 18 of SEBI Regulations  2015), our audit committee has concluded that, as of  March 31, 2016, our internal ﬁnancial controls were  adequate and operating effectively.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial  reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting, including the possibility of  collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and  not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial reporting may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Consolidated Financial Statements 149  Opinion In our opinion to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its  subsidiary companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal ﬁnancial controls  system over ﬁnancial reporting and such internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting were operating effectively  as at March 31, 2016, based on the internal control over ﬁnancial reporting criteria established by the Company and  its subsidiary companies incorporated in India considering the essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note.
Other Matter Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting insofar as it relates to 5 subsidiary companies, incorporated in India, is based  on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

Bhatt Aarthi Subramanian Rajesh Gopinathan  Director Executive Director Chief Financial Ofﬁcer  Suprakash Mukhopadhyay  Company Secretary Mumbai, April 18, 2016  Mumbai, April 18, 2016 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements154  Annual Report 2015-16 1) CORPORATE INFORMATION Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the Group”) provide  consulting-led integrated portfolio of information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services delivered through a network of  multiple locations around the globe.
The Group’s full services portfolio consists of IT and Assurance Services, Business Intelligence  and Performance Management, Business Process Services, Cloud Services, Connected Marketing Solutions, Consulting,  Eco-sustainability Services, Engineering and Industrial Services, Enterprise Security and Risk Management, Enterprise Solutions,  iON -Small and Medium Businesses, IT Infrastructure Services, Mobility Products and Services and Platform Solutions.
As at March 31, 2016, Tata Sons Limited owned 73.26 % of the Company’s equity share capital and has the ability to control its  operating and ﬁnancial policies.
The Company’s registered ofﬁce is in Mumbai and it has 61 subsidiaries across the globe.
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of preparation These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India  (‘Indian GAAP’) to comply with the Accounting Standards speciﬁed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as  applicable.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for  certain ﬁnancial instruments which are measured at fair value.
b) Principles of consolidation The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiary companies used in the consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting date as  of the Company.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the following basis: i) The ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies have been combined on a line-by-line basis by  adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Inter-company balances and transactions and  unrealised proﬁts or losses have been fully eliminated.
ii) The share of proﬁt / loss of associate companies is accounted under the ‘Equity method’ as per which the share of  proﬁt / loss of the associate company has been adjusted to the cost of investment.
An associate is an enterprise in  which the investor has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
iii) The excess of the cost to the parent of its investments in a subsidiary over the parent’s portion of equity at the date  on which investment in the subsidiary is made, is recognised as ‘Goodwill (on consolidation)’.
When the cost to the  parent of its investment in a subsidiary is less than the parent’s portion of equity of the subsidiary at the date on  which investment in the subsidiary is made, the difference is treated as ‘Capital Reserve (on consolidation)’ in the  consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
iv) Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries consists of the amount of equity attributable to the  minority shareholders at the dates on which investments in the subsidiary companies are made and further movements  in their share in the equity, subsequent to the dates of investments.
v)  On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss  on disposal.
c) Use of estimates The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires the management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of   the ﬁnancial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the year.
Example of such estimates include  provision for doubtful receivables, employee beneﬁts, provision for income taxes, accounting for contract costs expected  to be incurred, the useful lives of depreciable ﬁxed assets and provision for impairment.
Future results could differ due to  changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual result and the estimates are recognised in the period in  which the results are known / materialise.
d) Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation/amortisation.
Costs include all expenses incurred to bring the  assets to its present location and condition.
Fixed assets exclude computers and other assets individually costing ` 50,000 or less which are not capitalised except when  they are part of a larger capital investment programme.
e) Depreciation / Amortisation In respect of ﬁxed assets (other than freehold land and capital work-in-progress) acquired during the year, depreciation/  amortisation is charged on a straight line basis so as to write off the cost of the assets over the useful lives and for the assets  acquired prior to April 1, 2014, the carrying amount as on April 1, 2014 is depreciated over the remaining useful life based  on an evaluation.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 155  Type of asset Period Leasehold land and buildings Lease period Freehold buildings 20 years Factory buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease period Plant and machinery 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Ofﬁce equipment 5 years Electrical installations 10 years Furniture and ﬁxtures 5 years Goodwill 12 years Acquired contract rights 12 years Intellectual property / distribution rights 5 Years Rights under licensing agreement and Software licenses License period   Fixed assets purchased for speciﬁc projects are depreciated over the period of the project or the useful life stated above,  whichever is shorter.
f) Leases   Where the Group, as a lessor, leases assets under ﬁnance lease, such amounts are recognised as receivables at an amount  equal to the net investment in the lease and the ﬁnance income is based on a constant rate of return on the outstanding  net investment.
Assets taken on lease by the Group in its capacity as lessee, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance lease.
Such a lease is capitalised at the inception of the lease at lower of the fair value  or the present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised for an equivalent amount.
Each lease  rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest on the  outstanding liability for each year.
Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vests with the lessor, are  recognised as operating lease.
Lease rentals under operating lease are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss on a  straight-line basis.
g) Impairment   At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating  unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.
Recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows expected  from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount  rate that reﬂects the current market assessments of time value of money and risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to  beneﬁt from the synergies of acquisition.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for  impairment annually or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying  amount of goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying  amount of each asset in the unit.
h) Investments   Long-term investments and current maturities of long-term investments are stated at cost, less provision for other than  temporary diminution in value.
Current investments, except for current maturities of long-term investments, comprising  investments in mutual funds, government securities and bonds are stated at the lower of cost and fair value.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements156  Annual Report 2015-16 i)  Employee beneﬁts i) Post-employment beneﬁt plans Contributions to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are recognised as expense when employees have  rendered services entitling them to such beneﬁts.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full  in the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period in which they occur.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to  the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested or amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the  beneﬁts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt  obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any  asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future  contributions to the scheme.
ii) Other employee beneﬁts The undiscounted amount of short-term employee beneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered  by employees is recognised during the period when the employee renders the service.
These beneﬁts include  compensated absences such as paid annual leave, overseas social security contributions and performance incentives.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which  the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of  the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date.
j) Revenue recognition Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs  are incurred.
Revenue from turnkey contracts, which are generally time bound ﬁxed price contracts, are recognised over the life of  the contract using the proportionate completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion.
Foreseeable losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenue from the sale of equipment are recognised upon delivery, which is when the title passes to the customer.
Revenue from sale of software licenses are recognised upon delivery.
Revenue from maintenance contracts are recognised on pro-rata basis over the period of the contract.
In respect of Business Process Services, revenue on time and material and unit priced contracts is recognised as the related  services are rendered, whereas revenue from ﬁxed price contracts is recognised using the proportionate completion  method with contract cost determining the degree of completion.
Revenue is reported net of discounts.
Dividend is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on time proportion  basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
k) Taxation Current income tax expense comprises taxes on income from operations in India and in foreign jurisdictions.
Income tax  payable in India is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Tax expense relating to  foreign operations is determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are domiciled.
Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which gives rise to future economic beneﬁts  in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability, is considered as an asset if there is convincing evidence that the  Company and its Indian subsidiaries will pay normal income tax after the tax holiday period.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised  as an asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt  associated with it will fructify.
Deferred tax expense or beneﬁt is recognised on timing differences being the difference between taxable income and  accounting income that originate in one period and is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax  assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the  balance sheet date.
In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent  that there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available  to realise such assets.
In other situations, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable  certainty that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available to realise these assets.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid  and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the Group is able to  and intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right and these relate to  taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 157  l) Foreign currency transactions Income and expense in foreign currencies are converted at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency monetary assets and liabilities other than net investments in non-integral foreign operations are translated at  the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement  of proﬁt and loss.
Exchange difference arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of an enterprise’s net  investments in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward, option and futures contracts are amortised and recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss over the period of the contract.
Foreign exchange forward, option and future contracts  outstanding at the balance sheet date, other than designated cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at fair values and any gains or  losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
For the purpose of consolidation, income and expenses are translated at average rates and the assets and liabilities are  stated at closing rate.
The net impact of such change is accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve.
m) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign exchange forward, option and futures contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency  ﬂuctuations relating to certain ﬁrm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Group designates these hedging  instruments as cash ﬂow hedges.
The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide  written principles on the use of such ﬁnancial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy.
Hedging instruments are initially measured at fair value, and are remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in  the fair value of these derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised directly  in shareholders’ funds and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The Group  separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the fair value change  in the intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair value of the time value of derivative instruments is accumulated in  hedging reserve, a component of shareholders’ funds and is transferred to statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecast  transaction occurs.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualiﬁes for hedge accounting.
Cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in shareholders’ funds  is retained there and is transferred to statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ funds is transferred  to the statement of proﬁt and loss.
n) Inventories Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined  on a weighted average basis.
Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost  and net realisable value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods  produced or purchased by the Group are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material  and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.
o) Government grants Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions  attached to them and the grants will be received.
Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire capital  assets are presented by deducting them from the carrying value of the assets.
The grant is recognised as income over the  life of a depreciable asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
Other government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs for which they  are intended to compensate, on a systematic and rational basis.
p) Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable that an  outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions  (excluding retirement beneﬁts and compensated absences) are not discounted to its present value and are determined  based on best estimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These are reviewed at each balance  sheet date and adjusted to reﬂect the current best estimates.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the ﬁnancial  statements.
A contingent asset is neither recognised nor disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements.
q) Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers all highly liquid ﬁnancial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that  are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or less from the date  of purchase, to be cash equivalents.

31) EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS a) Deﬁned contribution plans The Company and its subsidiaries make Provident fund, Superannuation fund and foreign deﬁned contribution fund  contributions to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans for eligible employees.
Under the schemes, the Company  and its subsidiaries are required to contribute a speciﬁed percentage of the payroll costs to fund the beneﬁts.
In case of  Provident Fund, the contributions as speciﬁed under the law are paid to the Provident Fund where set up as a trust and to  the respective Regional Provident Fund Commissioner and the Central Provident Fund under the State Pension Scheme in  other cases in India and to the administrator of funds in case of foreign contribution plans.
In respect of Provident fund  contributions to trusts set up for this purpose, the Company and its subsidiaries are generally liable for annual contribution  and any deﬁciency in interest cost compared to interest computed based on the rate of interest declared by the Central  Government under the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme, 1952.
In addition to such contributions the Company also  recognises potential deﬁciency in interest, if any, computed as per actuarial valuation of interest as an expense in the year  it is determined.
As of March 31, 2016, the fair value of the assets of the fund and the accumulated members’ corpus is ` 9743.90 crores and  ` 9126.96 crores respectively, in respect of provident fund managed by trusts.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation,  there is no deﬁciency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings on the fund is greater than  the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of  8.80%.
The actuarial assumptions include discount rate of 7.75% and an average expected future period of 8 years.
The Group recognised ` 679.83 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 606.47 crores) for provident fund and pension fund contributions  and ` 248.91 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 222.44 crores) for superannuation contributions in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The contributions payable to these plans by the Group are at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the schemes.
The Group has contributed  ` 816.51 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 715.25 crores) towards other foreign deﬁned contribution  plans.
b) Deﬁned beneﬁt plans The Company and its subsidiaries in India provide to the eligible employees deﬁned beneﬁt plans such as gratuity, post  retirement medical beneﬁt, post retirement vacation and pension plan.
The Gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment  to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent  to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months.
Vesting occurs  upon completion of ﬁve years of service.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on th e  Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls system over ﬁnancial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally   accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal ﬁnancial control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures  that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions  of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or  improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that  the internal ﬁnancial controls over ﬁnancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s full services portfolio consists of IT and Assurance Services, Business Intelligence and Performance Management,  Business Process Services, Cloud Services, Connected Marketing Solutions, Consulting, Eco-sustainability Services, Engineering  and Industrial Services, Enterprise Security and Risk Management, Enterprise Solutions, iON-Small and Medium Businesses, IT  Infrastructure Services, Mobility Products and Services and Platform Solutions.
As at March 31, 2016, Tata Sons Limited owned 73.26% of the Company’s equity share capital and has the ability to control its  operating and ﬁnancial policies.
The Company’s registered ofﬁce is in Mumbai and it has 61 subsidiaries across the globe.
2)  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  a) Basis of preparation   These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India  (‘Indian GAAP’) to comply with the Accounting Standards speciﬁed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as  applicable.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for  certain ﬁnancial instruments which are measured at fair value.
Comparative ﬁgures do not include the ﬁgures of erstwhile CMC Limited which is amalgamated with the Company with  effect from April 1, 2015.
Consequently, the comparative ﬁgures are not comparable with the ﬁgures for the year ended  March 31, 2016.  b) Use of estimates   The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date  of the ﬁnancial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the year.
Examples of such estimates  include provisions for doubtful receivables, employee beneﬁts, provision for income taxes, accounting for contract costs  expected to be incurred, the useful lives of depreciable ﬁxed assets and provision for impairment.
Future results could differ  due to changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual result and the estimates are recognised in the  period in which the results are known / materialise.
c) Fixed assets   Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation / amortisation.
Costs include all expenses incurred to bring the  asset to its present location and condition.
Fixed assets exclude computers and other assets individually costing ` 50,000 or less which are not capitalised except when  they are part of a larger capital investment programme.
d) Depreciation / amortisation   In respect of ﬁxed assets (other than freehold land and capital work-in-progress) acquired during the year, depreciation /  amortisation is charged on a straight line basis so as to write-off the cost of the assets over the useful lives and for the assets  acquired prior to April 1, 2014, the carrying amount as on April 1, 2014 is depreciated over the remaining useful life based  on an evaluation.
Type of asset Period Leasehold land and buildings Lease period Freehold buildings 20 years Factory buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease period Plant and machinery 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Ofﬁce equipment 5 years Electrical installations 10 years Furniture and ﬁxtures 5 years Intellectual property / distribution rights 5 years Rights under licensing agreement License period   Fixed assets purchased for speciﬁc projects are depreciated over the period of the project or the useful life stated above,  whichever is shorter.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Annual Report 2015-16 Unconsolidated Financial Statements198  e) Leases Assets taken on lease by the Company in its capacity as lessee, where the Company has substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance lease.
Such a lease is capitalised at the inception of the lease at lower of the  fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised for an equivalent amount.
Each  lease rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest  on the outstanding liability for each year.
Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vest with the lessor, are  recognised as operating leases.
Lease rentals under operating leases are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss on  a straight-line basis.
f) Impairment  At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating  unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.
Recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows expected  from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount  rate that reﬂects the current market assessments of time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
g) Investments Long-term investments and current maturities of long-term investments are stated at cost, less provision for other than  temporary diminution in value.
Current investments, except for current maturities of long-term investments, comprising  investments in mutual funds, government securities and bonds are stated at the lower of cost and fair value.
h) Employee beneﬁts (i) Post-employment beneﬁt plans  Contributions to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are recognised as expense when employees have  rendered services entitling them to such beneﬁts.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full  in the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period in which they occur.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to  the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, or amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the  beneﬁts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt  obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any  asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future  contributions to the scheme.
(ii) Other employee beneﬁts The undiscounted amount of short-term employee beneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered  by employees is recognised during the period when the employee renders the service.
These beneﬁts include  compensated absences such as paid annual leave, overseas social security contributions and performance incentives.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which  the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of  the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date.
i) Revenue recognition Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs  are incurred.
Revenue from turnkey contracts, which are generally time bound ﬁxed price contracts, are recognised over the life of  the contract using the proportionate completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion.
Foreseeable losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenue from the sale of equipment are recognised upon delivery, which is when title passes to the customer.
Revenue from sale of software licences are recognised upon delivery.
Revenue from maintenance contracts are recognised pro-rata over the period of the contract.
In respect of Business Process Services, revenue on time and material and unit priced contracts is recognised as the related  services are rendered, whereas revenue from ﬁxed price contracts is recognised using the proportionate completion  method with contract cost determining the degree of completion.
Revenue is reported net of discounts.
Dividend is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on time proportion  basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements 199  j) Taxation Current income tax expense comprises taxes on income from operations in India and in foreign jurisdictions.
Income tax  payable in India is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Tax expense relating to  foreign operations is determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are domiciled.
Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which gives rise to future economic beneﬁts  in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability, is considered as an asset if there is convincing evidence that the  Company will pay normal income tax after the tax holiday period.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as an asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt associated with it will  fructify.
Deferred tax expense or beneﬁt is recognised on timing differences being the difference between taxable income and  accounting income that originate in one period and is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax  assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the  balance sheet date.
In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent  that there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available  to realise such assets.
In other situations, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable  certainty that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available to realise these assets.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid  and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the Company is able  to and intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right and these relate to  taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
k) Foreign currency transactions Income and expense in foreign currencies are converted at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency monetary assets and liabilities other than net investments in non-integral foreign operations are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt  and loss.
Exchange difference arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of an enterprise’s net investments  in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward, options and futures contracts are amortised and recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss over the period of the contract.
Foreign exchange forward, options and futures contracts  outstanding at the balance sheet date, other than designated cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at fair values and any gains or  losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
l) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses foreign exchange forward, options and futures contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign  currency ﬂuctuations relating to certain ﬁrm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Company designates these  hedging instruments as cash ﬂow hedges.
The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Company’s policy approved by the Board of Directors, which provide  written principles on the use of such ﬁnancial derivatives consistent with the Company’s risk management strategy.
Hedging instruments are initially measured at fair value, and are remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in  the fair value of these derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised directly in  shareholders’ funds and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The Company  separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the fair value change  in the intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair values of the time value of option, is accumulated in hedging reserve,  a component of shareholders’ funds and is transferred to the statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecast transaction  occurs.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualiﬁes for hedge accounting.
Cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in shareholders’ funds is  retained there and is transferred to the statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ funds is transferred  to the statement of proﬁt and loss.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Annual Report 2015-16 Unconsolidated Financial Statements200  m) Inventories Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined  on a weighted average basis.
Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of  cost and net realisable value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods  produced or purchased by the Company are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material  and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.

As of March 31, 2016, the fair value of the assets of the fund and the accumulated members’ corpus is ` 9743.90 crores  and ` 9126.96 crores respectively.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation, there is no deﬁciency in the interest cost as  the present value of the expected future earnings on the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to  the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of 8.80%.
The actuarial assumptions include  discount rate of 7.75% and an average expected future period of 8 years.
The Company recognised ` 658.04 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 571.65 crores) for provident fund contributions and  ` 193.02 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 163.47 crores) for superannuation contributions in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The  contributions payable to these plans by the Company are at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the schemes.
The Company has contributed ` 335.42 crores (March 31, 2015: ` 267.63 crores) towards foreign deﬁned contribution plans.
(b) Deﬁned beneﬁt plans   The Company makes annual contributions to the Employees’ Group Gratuity-cum-Life Assurance Scheme, a funded deﬁned  beneﬁt plan for eligible employees.
The scheme provides for lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death  while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 days salary for service less than 15  years, three-fourth month’s salary for service of 15 years to 19 years and one month salary for service of 20 years and more,  payable for each completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months.
Vesting occurs upon completion of ﬁve  years of service.
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation and the related current service cost are measured using the Projected  Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The following table sets out funded status of the gratuity plan and the amounts recognised in the Company’s ﬁnancial  statements as at March 31, 2016.
