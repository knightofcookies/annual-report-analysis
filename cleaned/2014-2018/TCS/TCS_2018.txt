It is a matter of immense pride that today, 50 years later,  your Company is one of the largest IT service-providers  globally, a trusted partner to so many Fortune 500  corporations in their digital transformation journeys, and  counted among the top three IT services brands globally.
TCS is an inspiring story of a successful technology  start-up.
Over the past five decades, your Company has  emerged from each cycle of technology change – from  mainframes to the digital era – stronger, with bigger  footprints across markets with more capabilities, solutions  and customers.
It has seeded and opened up new markets  in Latin America, Europe, China and Japan for the industry.
It has built an industry-wide ecosystem of students and  academic institutions to develop new capabilities and  innovations on a continuous basis.
As technology is infused into every aspect of business and  society today, its power to disrupt has only magnified the  process of creative destruction.
Against this backdrop, your  Company’s strong growth and customer impact over the  last five decades in a dynamic global industry to emerge as  a leader in its field is a worthy achievement.
What has helped your Company sustain its journey has  been its strong value systems, its ability to always put  the customer at the center of its strategy and a never- ending desire to collaborate and learn.
What also stands  out are the employees who have made this possible  with their strong customer focus, agile mindset and a  strong performance ethic.
TCS has invested in the right  capabilities, at the right time, and at scale; helping it  to stay relevant to customers through every period  of technology change.
Empowering employees and  helping them realize their potential has resulted in an  entrepreneurial, innovative, and agile organization.
TCS has also inspired trust in all its stakeholders by  delivering an experience of certainty in everything   it does.
I believe that longevity is not an end in itself but   an opportunity for your Company to make a     sustainable impact on society by aligning the   interests of the organization with those of all our  stakeholders.
TCS has been pursuing a very well   thought out, global Corporate Social Responsibility  program with measurable outcomes in sectors like  education, healthcare and the environment.
In every community that TCS touches, it has been  a force of good, creating skills and well-paying jobs  that boost the local economies, promoting health and  CHAIRMAN It is a matter of immense pride that  today, 50 years later, your Company is  one of the largest IT service-providers  globally, a trusted partner to so many  Fortune 500 corporations in their  digital transformation journeys, and  counted among the top three   IT services brands globally.
Letter from the Chairman | 05 wellness of its constituents as well as driving environmental  sustainability.
Our efforts in many parts of the world to reduce  the inequities caused by the digital skill divide, and to build  future generations of digitally savvy individuals, are scaling up  very well.
All this, and the structured volunteering programs  offered to employees have imbued a higher sense of purpose  in the organization.
The onset of digital technologies is very different from prior  technology changes, and is having a far more profound impact  on businesses and entire industries, triggering very deep- rooted transformations that will play out over the next few  years.
The changes we are seeing are a direct outcome of the  explosion of data in the last few years.
Leading organization of  the last many years were renowned for their process maturity,  today’s winners will be decided by their data maturity.
Forward thinking enterprises have been investing over the  last few years to harness the abundance of data within the  enterprise and outside, to design products and experiences  that are highly personalized for their customers.
They will rely  ever more on strategic partners like TCS, who possess a deep  contextual knowledge of their business, and a full range of  technology capabilities.
Your Company’s strategic and early  investments in Digital have positioned it well to benefit  from the immense opportunities that lie ahead.
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy  Services, I want to thank you for your continued trust,  confidence, and support.
Warm regards, N Chandrasekaran Chairman   06 | Letter from the CEO CEO Letter from the  Dear Stakeholder, It is my privilege to be writing to you from this desk on  completion of 50 years since our inception.
TCS was established on April 1, 1968, and over the last  five decades, your company benefited from the vision of  three outstanding leaders – F C Kohli, S Ramadorai and                 N Chandrasekaran.
Each of these leaders was instrumental  in taking the organization to the next level, and each left a  distinctive imprint on the company.
Our values, entrepreneurial agility, customer-centricity,  and social responsibility – all of which define who we are  and how we got here, are direct outcomes of their vision  and leadership.
Following in their footsteps and building  upon the accomplishments of these giants is humbling, and  inspirational.
Coming to the present, it has been a full year after our  leadership transition.
I am happy to report that it has  been a very stable and seamless experience for all our  stakeholders.
I want to take this opportunity to thank  our Chairman, Chandra, for his continuous guidance and  support in helping us through this tough and crucial  year.
His effortless combination of ensuring that I had all  the support he could give, and all the space I need, was  the single biggest driver for your company’s successful  transition into the new management structure.
I also  want to highlight the unique culture and value system of  the senior management team at TCS.
They accepted and  adopted the change in leadership wholeheartedly and  worked relentlessly to make it a success.
It is a matter of  great joy and pride for me that during this transition year,  each and every member of our leadership team stood  steadfast by your company.
The last year saw a steady acceleration on a path that  we were already on, and we used the opportunity to  make some incremental changes.
We refocused the  organization on the market opportunity presented by four  big themes: Intelligence, Agility, Automation and Cloud, and  reorganized the teams to align with these themes.
FY 2018 saw many of our  customers embark on the  refurbishment of their  core.
With our contextual  knowledge, domain expertise,  depth in digital and intellectual  property, we have been their  preferred partner in these  strategic initiatives.
We signed   several mega deals that are   industry-defining in nature.
In FY 2018, your Company delivered a reported revenue of  `123,104 crore, growing 4.4% over the prior year, which is 6.7%  growth in constant currency terms.
On a constant currency  basis, barring BFSI which grew 3.2% and Retail & CPG which  grew 1.5%, we had very strong growth in the other six industry  verticals, averaging 13.2% in aggregate.
Growth was led by   Energy and Utilities which grew 26.8%, Travel and Hospitality  which grew 22.4%, Life Sciences & Healthcare which grew 11.9%  and Communications & Media which grew 11.6%.
In terms of our markets, growth was led by Continental Europe  which grew 19.1% in constant currency, UK which grew 8.6%,  Latin America which grew 7.8% and India which grew 6.9%.
Operating margin was 24.8%, which was flattish year on year,  on a currency-adjusted basis.
Net profit was ` 25,826 crore,  a net margin of 21%.
In keeping with our shareholder friendly  capital allocation policy, the Board has recommended a final  dividend of `29 for the year, bringing the total dividend  payout for the year to `50 per share.
The Board has also  recommended a bonus issue in the ratio 1:1.
Letter from the CEO | 07 Business 4.0 Mid-year, we articulated our Business 4.0 thought   leadership framework that allows enterprises to leverage   digital technologies to further their growth and   transformation agendas.
The defining attributes of successful enterprises in the Business  4.0 world are their ability to mass personalize the customer  experience – sometimes at a very granular, transactional level;  actively leverage ecosystems and embrace risk to deliver  exponential value.
They are agile, intelligent, automated and  on the cloud.
At the core of Business 4.0 is a shift in mind-set,  from optimizing the use of scarce resources to harnessing the  technology-enabled abundance of talent, compute power,  storage, and market reach.
During the year, we revamped our services portfolio  substantially, in tune with our Business 4.0 vision and evolving  buying behaviours in the market.
This is further strengthening  our engagement with other stakeholders in our customers’  organizations – like the CMO, COO, CFO and other CXOs, in  addition to the CIOs and CTOs that we have traditionally   worked with.
Our Business 4.0 framework is resonating very well with our  customers across every industry vertical, and guiding their  transformational journeys.
Their digital transformation is  proceeding at three levels: the digital core, the intelligence  layer and the experience layer.
While popular attention has  been on the latter two, the transformation of the core is a much  larger, more complex, and riskier undertaking – and yet, that  is the most critical program without which many of the digital  initiatives simply can’t progress further.
FY 2018 saw many of our customers embark on the  refurbishment of their core.
With our contextual knowledge,  domain expertise, depth in digital and intellectual property, we  have been their preferred partner in these strategic initiatives.
We signed several mega deals that are industry-defining in  nature.
Whether it was the largest Internet of Things (IoT) deal  that we signed with Rolls Royce, or the deal with Transamerica  to replace their fragmented, legacy core with a modern, cloud- based digital platform – the largest contract signed by TCS  till date – these are all examples of progressive organizations  embracing digital transformation at their core.
Unlike the large deals of the past which were large in scale, but  were mostly homogeneous in terms of the services sold, the  large deals we are now signing are very large in scope as well,  leveraging the full spectrum of our capabilities.
That makes  them very difficult for others to replicate, and strengthens our  competitive positioning.
Revenue from digital engagements  accounted for 21.2% of our revenue in FY 2018 and grew 35.3%  year on year.
08 | Letter from the CEO Another important proof point of our participation in our  customers’ Business 4.0 spend is the steady increase in the  number and size of the digital assignments they give us,  resulting in increased share of wallet.
At an aggregate level,  this is evident from the client metrics where we see a strong  progression of customers into higher revenue buckets on a  quarterly as well as annual basis.
For the full year, we added 3  more clients in the $100 Mn+ revenue band bringing the total to 38,   13 more clients in the $50 Mn+ revenue band, 17 more in the   $20 Mn+ band and 40 more in the $10 Mn+ band.
Research and Innovation Much of the Business 4.0 spending by customers is around  leveraging technology to innovate and gain competitive  advantage.
Our continued investments in Research and  Innovation, and in building intellectual property, have further  strengthened our transformational credentials.
Many of our  earlier research and innovation programs, now monetized into  successful platforms and solutions – such as the TCS Connected  Universe Platform, ignio™ and Optumera™ – performed very well  this year and helped differentiate TCS.
TCS built an Open Banking API Framework to help banks  accelerate their digital transformation journey.
The AI offerings  developed by our R&I teams in the areas of conversational  systems and natural language processing (NLP) were  successfully deployed internally in TCS for employee  engagement.
We continue to invest in research in cutting edge areas in  computational sciences – covering NLP, machine learning,  deep learning and data marketplaces, materials engineering,  behavioural sciences and bio-sciences – particularly in genome  interpretation for personalization of medicine and developing  biomarkers for early detection of diseases.
In addition to the research and innovation that happens within  TCS, we also leverage the innovation taking place in the start-up  ecosystem through the TCS Co-Innovation Network or COIN.
The program has now expanded its start-up connects to over  3000 start-ups in key innovation hubs in America, UK, Europe,  Asia and Australia.
The TCS Research Scholarship Program is now in its fourteenth  cycle, covering 261 PhD scholars across 33 institutes across  India.
67 individuals have obtained their PhD through this  program.
TCS Researchers presented 250+ papers in premier  conferences.
Your Company has filed more than 3,900 patent  applications to date, with 522 filings in FY 2018.
It has been  granted 654 patents as of March 31, 2018.
People TCS’ culture and people practices continue to differentiate  us from the rest.
We firmly believe that there are no legacy  people, only legacy technologies.
TCS had 394,998 employees  at the end of FY 2018.
While we continue to hire talent from  outside, we have doubled down on investing in internal talent  development at scale, empowering individuals to acquire  skills that will keep them relevant in an evolving technology  landscape.
In FY 2018, over 247,000 employees were trained  in digital technologies, resulting in them gaining over 861,000  digital competencies.
Our workforce continues to be young, dynamic and diverse.
Women make up 35.3% of our workforce.
We continue to  attract, retain, and engage top notch talent across the world.
For  the third consecutive year, TCS was recognized as a Global Top  Employer by the Top Employer Institute, and as one of the Best  Employers globally in the Forbes 2000 list.
The most gratifying validation of our employee-friendly  practices however, is the best-in-class retention rate we continue  to enjoy.
In FY 2018, our attrition rate in the IT Services segment  was 11%; once again, the lowest in the industry.
Beyond Business TCS and TCSers continue to make a big difference to every  community we touch, across the world.
In FY 2018, TCSers  volunteered over 570,000 hours for worthy social and  environmental causes in their respective communities.
Our  various CSR programs – be it the Adult Literacy Program and  BridgeIT in India, or goIT and related programs to encourage  STEM education and careers among students in North America  and elsewhere, are scaling up nicely and making a difference,  and estimated to have benefited over 900,000 people across   the world.
The cutting edge work we do for our customers, our best-in- class service quality, our reputation as a best employer, our  award winning Investor Relations program, our sponsorship  of various high profile marathons and other marketing efforts  including the #digitalempowers campaign, have all gone  towards elevating our brand and putting us firmly among the  top 3 brands in IT services globally.
In FY 2018, TCS was the  fastest growing brand by value, crossing the $10 Bn mark and  growing 14.4% year on year.
Looking forward, we only see greater opportunity ahead, as  businesses become more technology-intensive and depend  more on technology to drive competitive differentiation.
Our  agility, core attributes and belief systems which have ensured  our success over the last fifty years will continue to help us  benefit from each new wave of technology change, and create  ever more value for our stakeholders.
I thank you all for your  continued support and encouragement.

14 | Business 4.0 Business 4.0 Intelligent, Agile, Automated, and on the Cloud What Business 4.0 means to Global enterprises across Industries TCS is guiding many of its customers through Business 4.0 digital transformations—defining value  propositions, creating new business models, winning over new customers, and creating exponential  growth.
Successful adopters of Business 4.0 will embrace its four primary characteristics.
Embracing greater  segmentation and  responding to individual  transactions, customised  for a single customer in   a single instance.
Rapidly tapping into  the capabilities and  resources of partners  and competitors  through technology platforms, to influence  their entire value and  supply chains.
Delivering   Mass   Personalisation Leveraging Ecosystems Harnessing  Abundance Unimagined pools of capital exist   for those organisations that can  paint a vision of what the future  looks like and have the strength of  character and boldness of leadership  to execute on that task.
Abundance of Capital Enormous skilled talent pools can  be crowd-sourced and utilised  on-demand.
Enterprises have  to embrace the idea of blurred  organisational boundaries, where  old defin itions of “who is” and “who  isn’t” an employee are challenged.
Abundance of Talent Business 4.0 | 15 Creating true value  propositions that deliver   on customer demands for   the best products, world class services, instantaneous delivery, and incredible price points.
Responding to threats and  delivering new capabilities  much faster, by changing   the risk-mitigation mindset 180 degrees to that of  “embracing risk” and  “adapting and   transforming continuously ”.
Creating Exponential   Value Embracing Risk Companies’ infrastructure and assets  are increasingly becoming insufficient  to meet today’s rapidly expanding  needs.

For example, a traditional process like  pricing which was based on a few variables earlier,  now stands transformed by TCS’ Optumera™ suite  which uses a rich set of 500 factors like weather,  online metrics, competitor prices, local events,  category-specific characteristics to determine the  optimal pricing, accounting for the impact of each  factor on the other.
Similarly other processes like  forecasting, replenishment, transportation, space,  assortment, sales and marketing can be completely  transformed to create exponential value using  advanced analytics and machine learning.
TCS is  working with leading grocery retailers, to leverage  the data from various IoT sensors and supply  chain networks to provide real time updates on  fresh produce - like strawberry, lettuce – across  the supply chain.
This intelligence has reduced  the overall dwell time by up to 25 hours, resulting  in reduced wastage in stores and substantially  improved the home life of fresh produce for the  consumer.
The data generated is driving the  complete supply chain ecosystem towards greater  agility and efficiency.

Consequently, TCS has gained significant share  of wallet and is the preferred partner for our  customers in their Digital initiatives.
Revenues from Digital engagements constituted  21.2% of the Company’s revenues in FY 2018,  growing by 35.3% in constant currency over the  prior year.
The growing market share in Digital and  glowing client testimonials of TCS’ capabilities  are also reflected in the high rankings assigned  to TCS in the various competitive assessments  pertaining to Digital capabilities, published  by various industry analyst firms.

Talent Diversity   TCS is an Equal Opportunity Employer and  subscribes to the Tata Code of Conduct in  embracing diversity in race, nationality, religion,  ancestry, marital status, gender, age, ethnic  origin, physical ability, and sexual orientation.

Gender  and any of the other diversity parameters do  not play a part in determining compensation  levels.
TCS has a well-defined Diversity and  Inclusion Policy.
TCS’ diversity-focused talent acquisition strategy  has resulted in greater diversity of gender,  geographic locations, and academic discipline.

Our Center of Excellence for Accessibility works  on IT solutions for differently-abled individuals,  aiding their integration into the workforce.
c. Talent Development   Investment in human capital by equipping  employees with skills – soft skills, design skills,  multi-technology skills and domain skills –  has been one of the biggest drivers of value  creation at TCS.
Over the last five decades,  TCS has navigated every technology change  by investing in organic talent development,  in keeping with its core value of fostering a  culture of lifelong learning.
The sheer scale and  rapidity of technology change in the Business  4.0 world called for a reimagined approach  to reskilling, quickly, at scale, and catering to  the millennial workforce’s preference to pick  up knowledge only when needed, only to the  extent required, and through experimentation  and social consultation.
TCS’ response to this has been the Digital  Learning Platform - an integrated ecosystem  64 I Management Discussion and Analysis Annual Report 2017-18 that combines virtual, physical and experiential  learning infrastructure with high quality  content, available any place, any time and on  any device.

3 World Economic Outlook, April  2018, International Monetary Fund 68 I Management Discussion and Analysis Annual Report 2017-18 7.0 Risk Management and Compliance  Our global operations bring in considerable complexities and in response to that, we have established a robust  enterprise risk and compliance management framework and process.
This process is enabled by a digital platform  that provides an enterprise-wide view of risks and compliance which enables us to take a more holistic approach  towards informed decision making.
Our efforts in incorporating better practices were recognized at the India Risk Management Awards - 2018 held by  ICICI-Lombard and CNBC TV18 , where TCS won two awards in two categories: ‘Best Risk Management Framework &  Systems – IT – ITES’ and ‘Best Risk Management Framework & Systems – Private Company.’  Listed below are our key risks with its anticipated impact on the company and mitigation plans.
Key Risks Impact on the Company Mitigation Volatile  global  political and  economic  scenario Corporate spending on technology has  shown strong correlations with GDP growth.
The company derives a material portion of  its revenues from customers’ discretionary  spending which is linked to their business  outlook.
Political disruptions or volatile  economic conditions may adversely affect  that outlook result in reduced spending which  could restrict revenue growth opportunities.
• Broad-based, de-risked business mix, well  diversified across geographies and industry  verticals • Offerings and value propositions targeting  all stakeholders in the customer organization,  covering discretionary as well as non- discretionary spends, and relevant at every  point in the business cycle • Target market segments which might provide  counter-cyclical support Growing  protectionist  trends and  restrictions  on global  mobility Distributed software development models  require the free movement of people across  countries and current rhetoric in many key  markets poses a threat to the global mobility of  skilled professionals.
Enactment of legislations  which restrict the availability of work visas or  apply onerous eligibility crtieria or costs could  lead to project delays, increased costs and  margin pressures.
• TCS is monitoring the global environment  closely and working with advisors, partners  and governments • We have materially reduced our dependency  on work visas through increased local hiring  and focusing on local mobility and training  across all major geographies of operation • Increased participation in academic  partnerships and initiatives to attract local  talent • Increased outreach to legislative / regulatory  stakeholders, important trade bodies, think  tanks and research institutes • Showcasing investments, employment  generation and innovation capabilities to the  appropriate audiences • Active engagement in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Math (STEM) initiatives  designed to structurally increase the  availability of engineering talent in major  markets Management Discussion and Analysis I 69 Key Risks Impact on the Company Mitigation Business  model  changes Rapidly evolving technologies are changing  technology consumption patterns, creating  new classes of buyers within the enterprise,  giving rise to entirely new business models  and therefore new kinds of competitors.
This is resulting in increased demands on  the Company’s agility to keep pace with the  changing customer expectations.
Failure to  cope may result may result in loss of market  share and impact business growth.
• Continued investments in Digital through  large scale reskilling, external hiring,  Intellectual Property (IP) development and  successful leverage of deep contextual  knowledge • Focus on Research and Innovation efforts  leveraging in house expertise, alliance  partnerships, and strong connections in the  academic start-up ecosystem, and launching  multiple new services • Strategic focus on business needs (tailored  Experience, ecosystems, exponential models  and embracing risk) and technology needs  (Intelligence, Agile, Cloud, and Automation) • Strong customer-centricity which results in  organization structures (and reorganizations)  that are always aligned to customer needs Litigation  risks Given the scale and geographic spread of  the company’s operations, litigation risks can  arise from commercial disputes, perceived  violation of intellectual property rights and  employment related matters.
Our rising  profile and scale also makes us a target to  litigations without any legal merit.
This risk is  inherent to doing business across the various  countries and commensurate with risk faced  by other players similarly placed in the industry.
In addition to incurring legal costs and  distracting management, litigations garner  negative media attention and pose reputation  risk.
Adverse rulings can result in substantive  damages.

The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase  transparency and accountability in an organisation’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal  control.
The framework requires a company to identify and analyse risks and manage appropriate responses.
The  Company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.
TCS’s internal controls are commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations.
These have been designed to  provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information,  complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorised use, executing transactions with proper  authorisation and ensuring compliance of corporate policies.
TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with  authority limits for approving revenue as well as expenditure.
Processes for formulating and reviewing annual and  long term business plans have been laid down.
TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system  to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes and connects to different  locations for efficient exchange of information.
It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with  global best practices.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in  Clause 17 of SEBI Regulations 2015) as of March 31, 2018.
B S R & Co. LLP, the statutory auditors of TCS has audited the financial statements included in this annual report  and has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of  Companies Act 2013).
TCS has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its activities.
The audit is based on an  internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and the audit committee.
In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls  and risks in its operations such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, employee engagement,  travel, insurance, IT processes, including most of the subsidiaries and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialised third party consultants and professional for business specific  compliances such as quality management, service management, information security, etc.
The audit committee  reviews reports submitted by the management and audit reports submitted by internal auditors and statutory  auditors.
Suggestions for improvement are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective action.
The  audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal  control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its major observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies Act 2013 and Clause 18 of SEBI Regulations 2015),  our audit committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2018, our internal financial controls were adequate and  operating effectively.

For B S R & Co. LLP  Chartered Accountants  Firm’s Registration No: 101248W/W-100022    Yezdi Nagporewalla Mumbai Partner 19 April 2018 Membership No: 049265 Corporate Sustainability Report I 93 TCS has had a tradition of enabling social good, through  structured Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs  and volunteering.
Through such programs, TCS enables  individuals and communities to take charge of their own  lives and improve their standard of living, as embodied by  the guiding principle: “Impact through Empowerment”.
At TCS, the key impact areas for CSR are education and  skilling, health and wellness and environment.
TCS is also  involved in the preservation of heritage structures.
To  run CSR programs, TCS partners with TATA Trusts, clients,  NGOs, and various not-for-profit organizations.
These  collaborations help us serve marginalized communities  better.
The multiple CSR initiatives of TCS, have touched  917,325 lives in FY 2018, globally.
TCS Maitree is an employee engagement forum that  provides associates an opportunity to express their  creativity.
Through its many interventions, Maitree  helps TCS associates and their families reach out to  underprivileged communities at office locations worldwide.
Volunteers bring in with them valuable expertise and a  spirit of generosity, and collectively contributed 571,998  volunteering hours in FY 2018.
The vehicle for this change  is Purpose for Life (P4L), a collaborative TCS volunteering  platform.
Education and Skilling The choice of education as a theme flows from TCS’  presence in the knowledge domain.
The standard of  education is a key factor that plays into both growth and  sustainability.
It is an integral component of development,  and is critical to a community’s ability to compete in a  rapidly-changing technology landscape.
This covers the  entire life path of students from school to Ph.D. as also  skilling and adult literacy that enables livelihood.
These  contributions through TCS’ varied education programs in  India, impacted 440,000 beneficiaries in FY 2018.
This is a story about 14 formidable women.
Members of Iswar  Sankalpa, an NGO that works to uplift differently abled women,  they have scripted a brand new life story for themselves using  TCS’ Computer-based Functional Literacy (CBFL) solution.
69  differently abled women from Iswar Sankalpa have used CBFL  to learn the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic.
By  August 2017, 14 of these women were able to successfully clear  the OBE Level A exam conducted by the National Institute of  Open Schooling.
With this ethos in mind, TCS launched the Adult Literacy  Program (ALP) in year 2000.
It uses the CBFL solution to  augment and accelerate the Indian government’s efforts  to achieve functional literacy across the country.
CBFL  software is available in nine Indian and three foreign  languages.
ALP enables adult learners to achieve functional literacy  (reading, writing and arithmetic) in their respective native  languages in approximately 50 to 55 learning hours.
TCS  has partnered with government and jail authorities, NGOs,  group companies and other corporates for the successful  implementation of the program.
In FY 2018, ALP reached  173,876 learners, with a total reach of 561,884 beneficiaries  since its inception.
The Adult Literacy Program delivers basic lessons in reading,  writing and arithmetic through TCS’ CBFL solution Often, there are societal barriers that crop up even before  people can take a step towards continued learning.
TCS’  BridgeIT program uses digital tools to address such access  and competency gaps between marginalized communities  and mainstream society.
Launched in February 2014, the  program uses Information Technology (IT) as a key enabler  for school education, adult literacy and entrepreneurship  in villages across central and east India.
Sustainability Report Corporate 94 I Corporate Sustainability Report Annual Report 2017-18 The youngest in a family of seven, 23-year-old DCA graduate  and BridgeIT entrepreneur Amuk Raj serves as an inspiration  to unemployed and under-employed youth in his village of  Bharatpur in Jhansi district, Uttar Pradesh.
With the money  he earns through his business, Amuk is able to contribute  towards half of his family’s household expenses.
His biggest  breakthrough?
Convincing the people in his village to set aside  caste-based differences and make best use of the digital services  he offers.
Bridge IT entrepreneur serves as an inspiration to the  youth in Bharatpur, Jhansi District So far, 136 youth from socially and economically  disadvantaged communities across six Indian states have  been trained to be digital entrepreneurs through this  program.
TCS supports the digital entrepreneurs for an  initial period of two years to make them self- sufficient  and sustainable.
But merely bringing people up to speed with their more  privileged peers will not help improve the employment  rate.
For that, the employability skill gap would need  to be addressed first.
At this end of the spectrum, TCS  introduced the IT and BPS employability program, which  seeks to enhance the employability of undergraduate  students from rural engineering and science colleges by  training them in business skills, general aptitude, and  technical skills.
The IT and BPS employability program seeks to enhance  the employability of undergraduate students from rural  colleges To enhance skills of its contract staff, TCS runs the Empower  program to provide them with functional spoken English,  basic computers and soft skills training.
TCS volunteers  conduct sessions within office premises for 25 hours, spread  across five weeks.
TCS runs a program for teachers as well, aiming to  assist them with soft skills training in communication,  presentation, empathy, ethics, organizational behaviour,  time management, and stress management.
Teachers  have participated in the Teacher Empowerment Program  at Trivandrum, Chennai, Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Salem,  Nagercoil, Kochi, Hyderabad, Hosur, Bangalore and  Kolkata, since 2012.
While TCS provides people greater social mobility  and accessibility through these skilling and education  programs, a section of the population struggles to access  the very infrastructure used to impart these lessons.
For  instance, visually impaired persons have an additional  barrier to contend with when it comes to accessing  technology based jobs.
To address this gap and enhance  employment opportunities, TCS Maitree set up the  Advanced Computer Training Centre (ACTC) in 2008.
This  initiative, while improving the prospects of India’s visually  impaired workforce, also aims to change the perspectives  of employers regarding their potential and versatility.
ACTC familiarizes visually impaired persons with both  computer hardware and software to enhance their  employability TCS volunteers have been proactive in both leading and  launching initiatives.
A case in point is the group Women  of Waze (WoW), which is based in the Wazapur village  of Raigad district, Maharashtra.
Launched in 2007, with  the long-term objective of making women in Wazapur  financially independent, WoW trains them to make bags  in different styles and designs using jute, cotton, and  other materials.
They are also trained in making stoles  with shibori design and other home accessories.
TCS’ CSR is  focusing on developing their entrepreneurial skills in order  to empower them further and make them completely self- sustainable entrepreneurs.
Corporate Sustainability Report I 95 In step with the TATA group tradition, TCS has been involved  in strengthening the academic community around the  world through its Academic Interface Program (AIP).
This  program aims to bridge the gap between campuses and  corporates through various initiatives namely organizing  workshops for students, faculty development programs for  teachers and creating internship opportunities for students.
TCS, through its Research Scholar Program, has since  inception of the program, supported 324 scholars, pursuing  full time PhD in computing sciences, in India.
Scholars have  an opportunity to interact with TCS researchers and receive  mentoring.
60 research scholars have achieved their Ph.D.  till date.
To promote 21st century thinking among students and  encourage them to take on STEM (Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics) subjects, TCS has also been  running a series of student engagement programs across  the world.
TCS has reached over 354,000 students through  STEM initiatives across geographies.
In the United States, TCS partnered with Discovery  Education in 2017, to launch Ignite My Future in School,  which seeks to prepare more than 1 million students for  21st century careers.
This initiative seeks to transform  the US education system by embedding computational  thinking and problem solving into core school subjects such  as Mathematics, English, Social Studies and the Arts.
The  program provides teachers with digital tools, instructional  resources, and in-market support they need to guide  today’s youth.
TCS seeks to transform the education system by embedding  computational thinking in core school subjects goIT, TCS’ flagship community engagement program  increases interest in STEM and computer science through  design thinking, mobile app development, and mentorship  by TCS employee volunteers.
Primarily focused towards  middle school students under-represented in computing  fields, goIT offers a free and flexible program for schools,  non-profits, and other youth-serving institutions to help  students engage actively in computational thinking.
In Brazil, TCS partnered with the Sao Paulo municipal  government through the goIT program, to contribute to  the training of students and teachers in public schools,  as well as give underprivileged families access to the  technology market and encourage young students to  pursue IT careers.
In Europe, goIT continues to scale up in schools across  Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden, with the  program tailored as per local requirements in each region.
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, TCS runs an initiative  called IT Futures, which aims to inspire a generation  of young people to develop an interest in technology.
It engages secondary school to university students in  information and communication technology (ICT), through  coding, programming, and designing.
In South Africa, TCS launched ExoLab in partnership with  NASA and the Centre for the Advancement of Science in  Space.
The Exolab program is an experimental platform  that brings together classrooms and the International  Space Station, and enables children in South Africa to  conduct integrated STEM experiments.
TCS launches the first ExoLab experiment in South Africa  to conduct integrated STEM experiments In Australia and New Zealand, the push has been to correct  the gender imbalance in the STEM fields.
Towards this end,  TCS runs a dedicated week-long program, called goIT Girls  Work Experience, as part of which senior TCS executives  provide high school students insights into the various STEM  roles that exist across the business spectrum.
In FY 2018,  goIT Challenge was launched, which encourages high  school students to learn about and apply technologies such  as big data, mobility, social media, cloud computing, and  robotics, to community challenges.
As part of our efforts to raise STEM awareness in the  Singapore community, TCS has worked closely with schools  96 I Corporate Sustainability Report Annual Report 2017-18 inviting students to understand the IT industry better  as well as embark on an e-learning journey on popular  programming languages (C++/Python).
Singapore goIT – students interact with a robot at the TCS  office In remote tribal areas in India, TCS is providing access  to quality education by setting up science and math  laboratories for children in partnership with TATA  Trusts.
Children and adults from the Kalahandi, Kandhamal,  and Rayagada districts of Odisha have received access to  modern equipment and learning protocol.
Enthused by the positive reception the labs received,  TCS then decided to take the concept on the road with  the Lab on Bike program, launched at 19 government  schools around Bengaluru and 10 government schools in  Ahmedabad.
The key objective of the program is to make  learning accessible by bringing it to the doorstep of the  most vulnerable and disadvantaged children.
To help senior secondary school students gain a strong  foundation in IT, programming, and applications, TCS  launched InsighT.
This program takes students through  the software development lifecycle and lays emphasis on  application concepts.
A similar program called LaunchPad  teaches programming logic to secondary school students  through gamified learning, and has reached students  across India, Muscat and Singapore.
Health and Wellness Health is an important societal dimension that needs  significant attention and investment from all stakeholders.
Globally, TCS has been leveraging its Fit4Life initiative  for building a fraternity of health and fitness conscious  employees and creating a culture of fitness.
TCS has been providing IT solutions, logistics and operations  support to  Tata Medical Center (TMC), Kolkata and Cancer  Institute (CI) in Chennai to improve comprehensive cancer  care and research.
TCS’ Translational Cancer Research Centre is set up in  partnership with TMC,  to develop technology for clinical  trials, risk adapted treatment, predictive outcome and  biomarkers – driven by a strategy to strengthen the impact  of cancer.
Digital Nerve Centre (DiNC), is an innovative platform  that enables re-imagined access to healthcare.
It leverages  digital technologies, to coordinate and connect hospitals,  specialists and patients.
Using DiNC, TCS along with the  Ministry of Health and TATA Trusts have re-imagined  patient interactions with the hospital system in four major  cancer hospitals.
DiNC doctor connecting with empanelled specialist for  Virtual Consultation AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) OPD  Transformation project is another social initiative where  TCS introduced new technology and streamlined innovative  processes that will benefit more than 3 million patients  visiting 21 OPDs at the hospital each year.
The process has  helped eliminate overcrowding and reduce waiting time  for patients, from six hours on an average, to less than two  hours.
TCS has been supporting the Society for Rehabilitation  of Crippled Children (SRCC) with the redevelopment  of the children’s hospital.
All funds raised by TCS at the  Mumbai Marathon are directed towards this cause.
TCS  has also supported the IT infrastructure and application  development process at SRCC.
When it comes to promoting better health practices among  employees, clients, as well as stakeholder communities,  TCS believes in leading from the front, which is why  we wholeheartedly participate in the American Heart  Association’s (AHA’s) yearly Heart Walks.
The idea is to  raise funds and create awareness to save lives from the  no.1 and no.5 killers in the US – heart disease and strokes,  respectively.
TCS North America also participates in AHA’s  national campaign, ‘Go Red for Women’, in the US and in  the Heart Month each February, through the Heart and  Stroke Foundation in Canada.
Across North America, TCS organizes volunteer activities  that reflect the health and wellness needs of the  Corporate Sustainability Report I 97 communities where our employees live and work.
These  activities include meal sorting and packing at food banks  to support low-income families.
TCS also works closely with  the American Red Cross (ARC) and the Canadian Red Cross  to respond to natural disasters.
TCS associates frequently organize and support meal  sorting and packing activities at food banks In UK, TCS started a partnership with the British Heart  Foundation (BHF) in 2016, to help spread awareness about  heart health.
This partnership supports our associates  in many aspects of their well-being, from providing  opportunities to volunteer and fundraise, to providing  tailored information about individual employees’ health.
Environment Environmental responsibility is one of the main aspects of  sustainable development.
TCS strives to create a continuing  positive impact on the health of the environment.
This  has been made possible by adopting and implementing  an organization-wide environmental policy; creating  awareness among associates; increasing the amount and  scope of responsibility towards the environment; and  introducing environmental responsibility into the core  values of the organization.
TCS’ Environmental Sustainability strategy is aligned to  mitigate the climate change related risks by using scarce  resources responsibly and doing more with less.
The core to  TCS’ environmental management is the strategy supported  by process, performance and people.
1.
Process Focus:  TCS has been one of the pioneers in the IT-sector to  be certified to the international standard, ISO 14001,  for its Environment Management System (EMS) in  as early as 2003.
Keeping up the momentum, we  successfully migrated to ISO 14001:2015 version of  the standard this year under the enterprise-wide  certification covering 112 locations globally.
The  TCS Environmental Policy, integrates environmental  considerations into business processes and adopts  a life cycle approach across our value chain.
Energy,  carbon, water and waste are the most material  environmental aspects for our operations.
We  measure, manage and report on these aspects  covering our global operations.
2.
Performance  Energy Conservation and Carbon Management  The year has been quiet eventful with respect to  energy conservation and carbon management.
Energy as the key contributor to our carbon footprint  is the cornerstone of our carbon mitigation strategy.
TCS has achieved its 2020 target to reduce the  specific carbon footprint by 50%, this year – 2 years  ahead of the timeline.
Our overall specific energy  consumption reduced by 4.5% over FY17, and 51.4%  over baseline year FY08.
Our combined GHG emission  (Scope 1 + Scope 2) was 1.42 tCO2e/FTE; 52.5% less  than the baseline year 2008 and 6.8% less than the  last reporting year.
This has been possible through  concentrated efforts by various teams across the four  levers - Green Buildings, Efficient Operations, Green  IT and Use of Renewable energy.
We have 19.5 million square feet of office area  designed as per Green Building standards, which  makes up 50% of the total office space we currently  occupy.
Out of this, 16.7 million sq.
ft. is in the  form of campuses across India, which makes up  approximately 80% of the total owned workspaces.
The TCS Energy Management program has witnessed  rapid scaling up and further maturity during the year.
The program now covers over 135 facilities across  India.
The  Internet of Things (IoT) platform has been  significantly enhanced to also acquire asset (chillers,  air handling units, etc.)
level data which is analysed  to improve asset efficiency and operations.
Most  significant portion of our optimization falls in the  area of analytics leading to aligning / streamlining  heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)  operations and set-points, chillers and Air Handling  Unit (AHU) with ambient temperature levels,  occupancy levels, associate comfort levels, and  scheduling chiller operations to operate more  efficient chillers more frequently than less efficient  chillers.
Associate comfort data relating to cooling  and lighting is also monitored and tracked to ensure  optimal comfort levels.
The Resource Optimization  Centre (ROC) in Kochi has successfully blended  people, processes and technology to drive significant  energy savings during the year.
TCS India took up a major project to change the  98 I Corporate Sustainability Report Annual Report 2017-18 luminaires to LEDs across 21 locations which  contributed towards significant energy savings.
Major retrofits were carried out at some locations  with legacy infrastructure to improve the efficiency  levels.
Renewable energy use in our offices increased  to 8.45% as compared to 7.25% in the last reporting  year, towards achieving the 2020 target of 20% RE in  the energy mix.
This year we added 2.05 MW of Solar  Rooftop system across four locations, taking the  total installed capacity to 3.55MW.
The solar rooftop  installations across our campuses contribute towards  4403 MWh of energy.
Where there is a will there is a way!
TCS Deccan  Park, Hyderabad covered the open car parking with  a canopy of solar photovoltaics  We have continuously innovated and improved our  data center energy efficiency through initiatives like  rack cooling solutions, air-flow management, UPS  load optimization through modular UPS solutions  and centralized monitoring, reducing the Power  Utilization Efficiency (PUE) of 13 data centers to our  target of 1.65.
The average PUE across 23 key data  centers is at 1.71, compared to an industry average  of 1.8.
Water Conservation  Water is a scarce and a shared resource.
We strive  to optimize our water consumption through  conservation, sewage treatment and reuse and  rainwater harvesting.
All our new campuses are built  for 50% higher water efficiency, 100% treatment  and recycling of sewage, and rainwater harvesting.
In FY 2018, consistent water management measures  have helped us sustain our water consumption  performance a nearly constant levels compared to   FY 2017.
Implementation of rooftop collection  systems, storage tanks, and recharge trenches and  pits has led to a 13% increase in the rainwater  harvesting potential at TCS sites in FY 2018 over the  previous year.
Waste Reduction and Reuse  Being an IT services and consulting organization,  the waste coming out of our facilities is limited to  electronic and electrical waste, office consumables  and municipal solid waste.
There is also a relatively  smaller proportion of potentially hazardous wastes  such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil.
TCS’  waste management practices seek to ensure that less  than 5% waste is sent to landfills by 2020 by ensuring  segregation at source, reuse and recycle wherever  possible.
Food and Garden Waste Onsite composting and /or digestion sent to  piggeries as feed Hazardous & e-wastes Disposed through government authorized recyclers  in accordance with local laws Printer & Toner cartridges Sent back to manufacturer under product take  back arrangement Paper & Mixed Dry Waste Paper is sent for recycling Mixed dry waste - sent to scrap dealers or municipal  disposal  TCS’ waste management practices  In FY 2018, 34.7% of the total wet waste generated  was treated through onsite composting or bio- digester treatment.
Over 150 tons of compost was  generated from garden waste in FY 2018, helping  TCS avoid the use of chemical fertilizers and the  resultant soil and groundwater pollution.
Over 10  tonnes of manure generated from our campus Yantra  Park in Mumbai was donated to farmers from nearby  villages.
The organic manure has helped change the  face of the small village converting waste land into  cultivated land, thus providing for livelihood.
Corporate Sustainability Report I 99 By use of organic manure combined with new farming  techniques, conversion of barren land into cultivable land  In FY 2018, 18,727 items of obsolete or defunct  electronic and electrical equipment classified as  E-waste were disposed through government- authorized handlers or recyclers, in accordance with  the regulations of each country1.
For India operations,  hazardous wastes (as defined by regulations) are  handled and disposed of as per the Hazardous  Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2008, only  through government-authorized vendors.
As a result of TCS’ focus on resource use and waste  reduction, per capita paper consumption has reduced  by 9% over the prior year 85% over the baseline.
The  success of this drive can be attributed to the awareness  created among associates, and the enforcement of  printing discipline through automated and manual  means.
Paper waste is carefully segregated, shredded,  and sent for recycling.
In some cases, waste paper is  sent to NGOs, which supply stationery items such as  notepads and files made from recycled paper back to  TCS.
TCS continues to achieve 100% recycling of its  paper waste2.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Holding company and its subsidiary companies which are incorporated in India, are responsible  for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established  by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).
These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring  the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation  of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s and its subsidiary companies’, which are incorporated in India,  internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note  on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing,  issued by the ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls, both issued by the ICAI.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was  established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or  error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding  Company’s and its subsidiary companies’, which are incorporated in India, internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the  assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being  made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies which are incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an  adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were  operating effectively as at 31 March 2018, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective  company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1-35 As per our report of even date attached For and on behalf of the Board For B S R & Co. LLP Chartered Accountants N. Chandrasekaran V. Ramakrishnan Dr. Ron Sommer Aarthi Subramanian Firm’s registration no: 101248W/W-100022 Chairman CFO Director Director Yezdi Nagporewalla Rajesh Gopinathan O. P .
Bhatt V. Thyagarajan Prof. Clayton M. Christensen Partner CEO and Managing Director Director Director Director Membership No: 049265 N. Ganpathy Subramaniam Aman Mehta Dr. Pradeep Kumar Khosla Rajendra Moholkar Mumbai, April 19, 2018 COO and Executive Director Director Director Company Secretary Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 114 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18 1) Corporate information  Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively together with the employee  welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide consulting-led integrated portfolio of information technology (IT)  and IT-enabled services delivered through a network of delivery centres around the globe.
The Group’s full services  portfolio consists of IT and Assurance Services, Business Intelligence and Performance Management, Business Process  Services, Consulting, Digital Enterprise Services, Eco-sustainability Services, Engineering and Industrial Services,  Enterprise Security and Risk Management, Enterprise Solutions, iON - Small and Medium Businesses, IT Infrastructure  Services, IT Services and Platform Solutions.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India.
The address of its corporate office  is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai 400001.
As at March 31, 2018, Tata Sons Limited, the holding company  owned 71.89% of the Company’s equity share capital.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 were approved by the Board of Directors  and authorised for issue on April 19, 2018.
2) Significant accounting policies  (a) Statement of compliance   These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.
(b) Basis of preparation   These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis, except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting  policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for  goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(c) Basis of consolidation   The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it.
The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable  returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power  over relevant activities of the entity.
Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control  ceases.
All inter-company transactions, balances and income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for  as equity transactions.
The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests  are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.
Any difference between the  amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or  received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.
(d) Business combinations   The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting.
Acquisition related  costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities  and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the  acquisition date.
Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Where  the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values  of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is  made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements I  115 interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of  subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under common control are  accounted at historical cost.
The difference between any consideration given and the aggregate historical  carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded in shareholders’ equity.
(e)  Use of estimates and judgements   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported balances  of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
Key source of estimation of uncertainty at the date of consolidated financial statements, which may cause a  material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, is in respect  of impairment of goodwill, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, valuation of deferred tax assets,  provisions, contingent liabilities and fair value measurements of financial instruments have been discussed  below.
Key source of estimation of uncertainty in respect of revenue recognition and employee benefits have  been discussed in their respective policies.
Impairment of goodwill   The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on the future cash flows after  considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.
The estimated cash flows are developed using internal  forecasts.
The discount rate used for the CGU’s represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the  historical market returns of comparable companies.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period.
This  reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.
Valuation of deferred tax assets   The Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.
The policy  has been explained under note 2(k).
Provisions and contingent liabilities   A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate  can be made.
These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements.
Contingent assets are neither recognised  nor disclosed in the financial statements.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments   When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured  based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible,  but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes in assumptions about these  factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
The policy has been further explained  under note 2(l).
(f)  Revenue recognition    The Group earns revenue primarily from providing information technology, business solutions and consultancy  services through development and maintenance of IT applications and infrastructure, implementation of  enterprise solutions, business process services, assurance services, engineering and industrial services using its  own products, framework of solutions and third party products.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 116 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18   The Group recognises revenue as follows:   Contracts are unbundled into separately identifiable components and the consideration is allocated to  those identifiable components on the basis of their relative fair values.
Revenue is recognised for respective  components either at the point in time or over time, as applicable.
Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis is recognised as services are rendered and as  related costs are incurred.
Revenue from software development contracts, which are generally time bound fixed price contracts, is  recognised over the life of the contract using the percentage-of-completion method, with contract costs  determining the degree of completion.
Losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenue in  excess of billings is recognised as unbilled revenue in the balance sheet; to the extent billings are in excess of  revenue recognised, the excess is reported as unearned and deferred revenue in the balance sheet.
Revenue from Business Process Services contracts priced on the basis of time and material or unit of delivery is  recognised as services are rendered or the related obligation is performed.
Revenue from the sale of internally developed and manufactured systems and third party products which do  not require significant modification is recognised upon delivery, which is when the absolute right to use passes  to the customer and the Group does not have any material remaining service obligations.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period of the contract.
Revenue is recognised only when evidence of an arrangement is obtained and the other criteria to support  revenue recognition are met, including the price is fixed or determinable, services have been rendered and  collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured.
Revenue is reported net of discounts and indirect taxes.
(g) Dividend income is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised  using the effective interest method.
(h)  Leases   Finance lease   Assets taken on lease by the Group in its capacity as lessee, where the Group has substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classified as finance lease.
Such leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease  at lower of the fair value or present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised for an  equivalent amount.
Each lease rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain  a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability for each year.
Operating lease   Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vest with the  lessor, are recognised as operating lease.
Operating lease payments are recognised on a straight line basis over  the lease term, unless the lease agreement explicitly states that increase is on account of inflation.
(i) Cost recognition   Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and have been classified according to their nature.
The costs of the Group are broadly categorised into employee benefit expenses, cost of equipment and  software licences, depreciation and amortisation and other operating expenses.
Employee benefit expenses  include employee compensation, allowances paid, contribution to various funds and staff welfare expenses.
Other operating expenses mainly include fees to external consultants, facility expenses, travel expenses,  communication expenses, bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade receivables and  advances (net) and other expenses.
Other expenses is an aggregation of costs which are individually not  material such as commission and brokerage, recruitment and training, entertainment, etc.
(j) Foreign currency   The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`) whereas the functional  currency of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of their countries of domicile.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are restated into the functional currency using exchange  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements I  117 rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement of foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non- monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not  translated.
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company  have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Statement of profit and loss  has been translated using weighted average exchange rates.
Translation adjustments have been reported as  foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity.
(k) Income taxes   Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability  during the year.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they  relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the  current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income taxes   The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company, its overseas branches and its  subsidiaries in India and overseas.
The current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian  income tax payable on worldwide income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in  Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws  applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available for  set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable  to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting  advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax  paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
Deferred income taxes   Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities  are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition  of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither  accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused  tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the  deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable  temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the  temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the  foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to  taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax  consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their  respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 118 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18   Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which  is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured  reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.
(l) Financial instruments   Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial  assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value  measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
Cash and cash equivalents   The Group considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts  of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three  months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
Financial assets at amortised cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of  the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest  on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income   Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are  held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial  assets.
The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost  or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.
The transaction costs directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities   Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments   An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting  all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments recognised by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of  direct issue cost.
Hedge accounting   The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge  instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company and its subsidiaries  which are approved by their respective Board of Directors.
The policies provide written principles on the use of  such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract.
The Group  determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based  on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to  reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements I  119 ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have  been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement  of profit and loss.
The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in other  comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments  only the change in intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair value of the time value and intrinsic value  of an option is recognised in other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity.
Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit  and loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer  qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in  equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction  ultimately affects the profit and loss.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the  cumulative gain or loss accumulated in equity is transferred to the statement of profit and loss.
(m) Property, plant and equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and  impairment loss, if any.
Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the cost less residual value over  their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual values are  reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a  prospective basis.
The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below: Type of asset Method Useful lives Buildings Straight line 20 years Leasehold improvements Straight line Lease term Plant and equipment Straight line 10 years Computer equipment Straight line 4 years Vehicles Straight line 4 years Office equipment Straight line 5 years Electrical installations Straight line 10 years Furniture and fixtures Straight line 5 years   Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and  the asset is ready for its intended use.
(n) Goodwill and intangible assets   Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business  in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent  liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when  events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of  acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 120 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18   Intangible assets consist of acquired contract rights, rights under licensing agreement and software licences  and customer-related intangibles.
Following table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated  useful lives Nature of intangible Useful lives Acquired contract rights 3-12 years Rights under licensing agreement and software licences Lower of licence period and 2-5 years Customer-related intangibles 3 years  (o) Impairment   (i) Financial assets (other than at fair value)    The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets  is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance.
In  determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedient  by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.
The  provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking  information.
The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due  and rates used in the provision matrix.
For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at  an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected  credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.
(ii) Non-financial assets    (a) Tangible and intangible assets      Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
If any such  indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value- in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows  that are largely independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is  determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the  carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is  recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
(b) Goodwill      CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently  when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying  amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill  allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis of the carrying  amount of each asset in the unit.
(p)  Employee benefits   (i) Defined benefit plans    For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit  Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Remeasurement,  comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on  plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit  recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service cost, both  vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or  curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the  defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this  calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to  the scheme.
(ii) Defined contribution plans    Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered  services entitling them to such benefits.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements I  121   (iii) Compensated absences    Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in  which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance  sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the  end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially  determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
(q) Inventories   Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost  is determined on a weighted average basis.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods produced or  purchased by the Group are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material and  labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.
(r) Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the  Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
The Company did  not have any potentially dilutive securities in any of the years presented.
3) Recent Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2018  has notified the following new and amendments to Ind ASs which the Group has not applied as they are effective  for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2018:  Ind AS 115  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Ind AS 21   The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates  Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Ind AS 115 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from  contracts with customers.
Ind AS 115 will supersede the current revenue recognition standard Ind AS 18 - Revenue,   Ind AS 11 - Construction Contracts when it becomes effective.
The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods  or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer   Step 2: Identify the performance obligation in contract   Step 3: Determine the transaction price   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract   Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation  Under Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e.
when ‘control’  of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The Group has completed its evaluation of the possible impact of Ind AS 115 and will adopt the standard with all  related amendments to all contracts with customers retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying  the standard recognised at the date of initial application.
Under this transition method, cumulative effect of initially  applying Ind AS 115 is recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual  reporting period.
The standard is applied retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the  date of initial application.
The Group does not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be material  on its retained earnings and to its net income on an ongoing basis.
Ind AS 21 – The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates  The amendment clarifies on the accounting of transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance  consideration in a foreign currency.
The appendix explains that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of  determining the exchange rate, is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred  income liability.
If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, a date of transaction is established for each  payment or receipt.
The Group is evaluating the impact of this amendment on its financial statements.

Goodwill of ` 618 crores (March 31, 2017: ` 531 crores) has been allocated to the TCS business in France.
The estimated  value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent  to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 10.77%.
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation  to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on  reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the  CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.
The remaining amount of goodwill of ` 1,127 crores (March 31, 2017: ` 1,066 crores) (relating to different CGUs  individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the recoverable  amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

In respect of certain foreign subsidiaries, business losses can be carried forward indefinitely unless there is  a substantial change in the ownership.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlement.
These unexpired  business losses will expire based on the year of origination as follows: (` crores) March 31, Unabsorbed business losses 2019  4 2020  31 2021  11 2022  16 2023  - Thereafter  -  62  Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, Tata Consultancy Services Limited is liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax  in the tax holiday period.
MAT paid can be carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the  future tax liabilities.
MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is  probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.
Accordingly, Tata Consultancy  Services Limited has recognised a deferred tax asset of ` 2,217 crores.
Deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings of ` 7,164 crores of certain subsidiaries has not been recognised, as it  is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable  future.
The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with Income Tax authorities in India and in some of the  jurisdictions where they operate.
The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deductions,  computation or eligibility of tax incentives or allowances, and characterisation of fees for services received.
As  at March 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries have contingent liability of ` 5,639 crores (March 31, 2017:   ` 2,690 crores) in respect of tax demands which are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 130 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18 on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.
In respect of tax contingencies of ` 318 crores   (March 31, 2017: ` 318 crores), not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of  TCS e-Serve Limited.
The Group periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations  in the jurisdictions it operates in.
The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and ‎has concluded that any  consequent income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.
The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction.
The major tax jurisdictions  of Tata Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom.
In India, tax filings  from fiscal 2016 are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities.
In United States of America, the federal  statute of limitation applies to fiscals 2014 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state.
In  United Kingdom, the statute of limitation generally applies to fiscal 2015 and earlier.
On December 22, 2017, H.R.
1, originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” was signed into law (“US Tax Reforms”).
The law provides for a federal tax rate reduction from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% with effect from  January 1, 2018.

The Group is expected to contribute ` 159 crores to defined benefit plan obligations  funds for the year ended March 31, 2019 comprising domestic component of ` 147 crores and foreign component of  ` 12 crores.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements 144 I  Consolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18  The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and  expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes  of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions  constant.
If the discount rate increases (decreases) by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would decrease by ` 143 crores  (increase by ` 158 crores) as at March 31, 2018.
If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase by   ` 96 crores (decrease by ` 90 crores) as at March 31, 2018.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit  obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the  assumption may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has  been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that  applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Each year an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment  policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles.
Investment and contribution policies are integrated within  this study.
The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2018 as follows: (` crores) Year ending March 31, Defined benefit obligations 2019 241 2020 225 2021 235 2022 234 2023 243 Thereafter 1,018   Provident fund   In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to  receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate)  contribute monthly to a Trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled  to employees.
This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return  which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund.
A part  of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund.
The contributions made  by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit or loss under employee  benefit expenses.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance  issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in  the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected  amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government  administered provident fund.
All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident  fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government  administered provident fund plan.
A part of the company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered  pension fund.
This plan is a defined contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly  contributions made to the fund.
The contributions made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss  under employee benefit expenses.

Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled revenues, loans and trade payables as  at March 31, 2018 and 2017 approximate the fair value.
Difference between carrying amounts and fair values of  bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets, other financial liabilities and borrowings  subsequently measured at amortised cost is not significant in each of the years presented.
Fair value hierarchy  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either  observable or unobservable and consist of the following three levels:   Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined  in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
The financial instruments included in Level 2 of fair value hierarchy have been valued using quotes available for  similar assets and liabilities in the active market.
The investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy have  been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value.
The cost of unquoted investments approximate the  fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair  value within that range.

In addition to these currencies, the Group also does business in Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc,  Japanese Yen, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona, South African Rand, Singapore Dollar, Saudi Arabian Riyal,  Danish Kroner and Brazilian Real.
Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated  in Indian Rupee.
This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.
The Board of Directors of the Company has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame,  implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of  exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the  Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forwards, currency option and futures  contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

The Group has a risk  management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities.
The risk management  policy is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the  unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial  performance of the Group.

Market risk   Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because  of changes in market prices.
Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in  the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.
The Group’s  exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.
i.
(a) Foreign currency exchange rate risk   The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency  or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective  entities.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject  to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.
The risks primarily relate to fluctuations  in US Dollar, Euro, Great Britain Pound, Australian Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Danish Kroner  and Brazilian Real against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its  subsidiaries.
The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange.
Further, any movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major  foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international business.
The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate  risks.
It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management  policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure  and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective  functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and   Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity.
Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the  Group as disclosed in note 28(b).
The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2018:          (` crores) USD EUR GBP AUD SGD DKK BRL SAR Others* Net financial assets  2,481  349  266  145  1  16  -    383  683  Net financial liabilities  (298)  (1)  (6)  (7)  (10)  (74)  (25)  -    (243)   10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of   Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries would result in decrease / increase in the Group’s profit  before taxes by approximately ` 366 crores for the year ended March 31, 2018.

*Others include currencies such as South African Rand, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Norwegian Kroner etc.
Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements I  153   i.
(b) Interest rate risk   The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments.
Hence the Group is not  significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
ii.
Credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to  the contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of  deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit  limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after  obtaining necessary approvals for credit.
Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables,  unbilled revenue, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and  other financial assets.
Inter-corporate deposits of ` 4,797 crores are with a financial institution having a high  credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies.
Bank deposits include an amount of ` 2,000 crores held with  an Indian bank having high quality credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s  total bank deposits in year ended March 2018.
None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in  material concentration of credit risk.
Exposure to credit risk   The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to  credit risk was ` 81,771 crores as at March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: ` 79,313 crores), being the total of the  carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, unbilled revenue and  other financial assets.
The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of  outstanding trade receivable and unbilled revenue as at March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Geographic concentration of credit risk   The Group also has a geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and unbilled  revenue is as follows: As at March 31, 2018 As at March 31, 2017 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America  41.83  42.49  43.47  44.30  India  14.29  13.00  15.95  14.71  United Kingdom  13.46  13.59  13.39  13.46    Geographical concentration of is trade receivables and unbilled revenue allocated based on the location of the  customers.
iii.
Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations.
The objective of liquidity risk  management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.
The Group consistently generated sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its financial obligations as and  when they fall due.

Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013   (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of  the state of affairs, profit/loss (including other comprehensive income), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company  in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards   (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to  do so.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these standalone Ind AS financial statements based on our audit.
We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards and matters which are  required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.
We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing  specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements are free  from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the standalone  Ind AS financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the Company’s preparation  of the standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Company’s Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the  overall presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
We are also responsible to conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting  and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may  cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify the opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of the auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause an entity to cease to continue as a going  concern.
Unconsolidated Financial Statements I 165 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion  on the standalone Ind AS financial statements.

For B S R & Co. LLP  Chartered Accountants  Firm’s Registration No: 101248W/W-100022  Yezdi Nagporewalla  Mumbai Partner  19 April 2018 Membership No: 049265 Unconsolidated Financial Statements I 169 Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report (Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,  2013 (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 31  March 2018 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding  of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting   (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued  by ICAI.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained  and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control system over  financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the  assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being  made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such  internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2018, based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note issued by the ICAI.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and  services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(c) Use of estimates and judgements   The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles  of Ind AS requires the management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the  reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the  financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense for the periods presented.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
Key sources of estimation of uncertainty at the date of the financial statements, which may cause a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, is in respect of  impairment of investments, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, valuation of deferred tax assets,  provisions and contingent liabilities and fair value measurement of financial instruments have been discussed  below.
Key source of estimation of uncertainty in respect of revenue recognition and employee benefits have  been discussed in their respective policies.
Impairment of investments   The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at amortised cost annually, or more frequently  when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is accounted for.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment   The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period.
This  reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.
Valuation of deferred tax assets   The Company reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.
The  policy has been explained under note 2(i).
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  175   Provisions and contingent liabilities   A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate  can be made.
These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements.
Contingent assets are neither recognised  nor disclosed in the financial statements.
Fair value measurement of financial instruments   When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured  based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible,  but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes in assumptions about these  factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
The policy has been further explained  under note 2(j).
(d) Revenue recognition   TCS Limited earns revenue primarily from providing information technology, business solutions and consultancy  services through development and maintenance of IT applications and infrastructure, implementation of  enterprise solutions, business process services, assurance services, engineering and industrial services using its  own products, framework of solutions and third party products.
The Company recognises revenue as follows:   Contracts are unbundled into separately identifiable components and the consideration is allocated to  those identifiable components on the basis of their relative fair values.
Revenue is recognised for respective  components either at the point in time or over time, as applicable.
Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis is recognised as services are rendered and as  related costs are incurred.
Revenue from software development contracts, which are generally time bound fixed price contracts, is  recognised over the life of the contract using the percentage-of-completion method, with contract costs  determining the degree of completion.
Losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenue in  excess of billings is recognised as unbilled revenue in the balance sheet; to the extent billings are in excess of  revenue recognised, the excess is reported as unearned and deferred revenue in the balance sheet.
Revenue from Business Process Services contracts priced on the basis of time and material or unit of delivery is  recognised as services are rendered or the related obligation is performed.
Revenue from the sale of internally developed and manufactured systems and third party products which do  not require significant modification is recognised upon delivery, which is when the absolute right to use passes  to the customer and the Company does not have any material remaining service obligations.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period of the contract.
Revenue is recognised only when evidence of an arrangement is obtained and the other criteria to support  revenue recognition are met, including the price is fixed or determinable, services have been rendered and  collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured.
Revenue is reported net of discounts and indirect taxes.
(e) Dividend income is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised  using the effective interest method.
(f) Leases   Finance lease   Assets taken on lease by the Company in its capacity as lessee, where the Company has substantially all the  risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance lease.
Such leases are capitalised at the inception of the  lease at lower of the fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised  for an equivalent amount.
Each lease rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as  to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability for each year.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 176 I  Unconsolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18   Operating lease   Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vest with the  lessor, are recognised as operating lease.
Operating lease payments are recognised on a straight line basis over  the lease term in the statement of profit and loss, unless the lease agreement explicitly states that increase is  on account of inflation.
(g) Cost recognition   Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and have been classified according to their nature.
The costs of the Company are broadly categorised in employee benefit expenses, cost of equipment and  software licenses, depreciation and amortisation and other operating expenses.
Employee benefit expenses  include employee compensation, allowances paid, contribution to various funds and staff welfare expenses.
Other operating expenses mainly include fees to external consultants, facility expenses, travel expenses,  communication expenses, bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade receivable and  advances (net) and other expenses.
Other expenses is an aggregation of costs which are individually not  material such as commission and brokerage, recruitment and training, entertainment, etc.
(h) Foreign currency   The functional currency of the Company is Indian rupee (`).
Income and expenses in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the  transaction.
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing on the balance sheet date and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are  recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not  retranslated.
(i) Income taxes   Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability  during the year.
Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they  relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the  current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income taxes   The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its branches in India and  overseas.
The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on worldwide income  after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws  applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available for  set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting  advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax  paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
Deferred income taxes   Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities  are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition  of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor  taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused  tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the  deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  177   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to  taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax  consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their  respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which  is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured  reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.
(j) Financial instruments   Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial  assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value  measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
Cash and cash equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible into known  amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value and having original maturities of  three months or less from the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of  balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
Financial assets at amortised cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on  the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income   Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are  held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial  assets.
The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss   Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost  or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.
The transaction costs directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities   Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments   An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting  all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments recognised by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net  off direct issue cost.
Hedge accounting   The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge  instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 178 I  Unconsolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18   The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company which are approved  by the Board of Directors.
The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives  consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.
The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract.
The  Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged  item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge  instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception  and on an ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts  that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.
The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments  only the change in intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair value of the time value and intrinsic value  of an option is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate  component of equity.
Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related  hedged items affect profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer  qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in  equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction  ultimately affects the profit or loss.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative  gain or loss accumulated in equity is transferred to the statement of profit and loss.
(k) Investment in subsidiaries   Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment.
(l) Property, plant and equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and  impairment loss, if any.
Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment so as to expense the cost less residual value over  their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual value are  reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a  prospective basis.
The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below: Type of asset Method Useful lives Buildings Straight line 20 years Leasehold improvements Straight line Lease term Plant and equipment Straight line 10 years Computer equipment Straight line 4 years Vehicles Straight line 4 years Office equipment Straight line 5 years Electrical installations Straight line 10 years Furniture and fixtures Straight line 5 years   Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation is complete and the  asset is ready for its intended use.
(m)  Intangible assets   Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as of the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  179   Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over  license period which equates the useful life ranging between 2-5 years on a straight line basis.
(n)  Impairment   (i) Financial assets (other than at fair value)    The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial  assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance.
In  determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient  by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.
The  provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking  information.
The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due  and rates used in the provision matrix.
For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at  an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected  credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.
(ii) Non-financial assets    Tangible and intangible assets    Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
If any  such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the   value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that  are largely independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined  for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in  the statement of profit and loss.
(o) Employee benefits   (i) Defined benefit plans    For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit  Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses  are recognised in full in the other comprehensive income for the period in which they occur.
Past service  cost both vested and unvested is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment  or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination  benefits.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the  defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this  calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to  the scheme.
(ii) Defined contribution plans    Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered  services entitling them to such benefits.
(iii)  Compensated absences    Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in  which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance  sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the  end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially  determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 180 I  Unconsolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18  (p) Inventories   Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost  is determined on a weighted average basis.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods produced or  purchased by the Company are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material  and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.
(q) Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the  Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
The Company did  not have any potentially dilutive securities in any of the years presented.
3) Recent Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2018  has notified the following new and amendments to Ind ASs which the Company has not applied as they are effective  for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2018:  Ind AS 115   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Ind AS 21    The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates  Ind AS 115 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers  Ind AS 115 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from  contracts with customers.
Ind AS 115 will supersede the current revenue recognition standard Ind AS 18 – Revenue,   Ind AS 11 – Construction Contracts when it becomes effective.
The core principle of Ind AS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods  or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.
Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer   Step 2: Identify the performance obligation in contract   Step 3: Determine the transaction price   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract   Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation  Under Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e.
when ‘control’  of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The Company has completed its evaluation of the possible impact of Ind AS 115 and will adopt the standard with all  related amendments to all contracts with customers retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying  the standard recognised at the date of initial application.
Under this transition method, cumulative effect of initially  applying Ind AS 115 is recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual  reporting period.
The standard is applied retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the  date of initial application.
The Company does not expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be  material on its retained earnings and to its net income on an ongoing basis.
Ind AS 21 – The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates  The amendment clarifies on the accounting of transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance  consideration in a foreign currency.
The appendix explains that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of  determining the exchange rate, is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred  income liability.
If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, a date of transaction is established for each  payment or receipt.
TCS Limited is evaluating the impact of this amendment on its financial statements.

The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below: As at                               March 31, 2018 As at  March 31, 2017 Discount rate 7.75% 7.25% Rate of increase in compensation levels of covered employees 6.00% 6.00% Rate of return on plan assets 7.75% 7.25% Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations 8 years 8 years  The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit  plan obligations as at March 31, 2018.
The Company is expected to contribute ` 147 crores to defined benefit plan  obligations funds for the year ending March 31, 2019.
The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and  expected salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes  of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions  constant.
If the discount rate increases (decreases) by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would decrease by ` 79 crores  (increase by ` 85 crores) as at March 31, 2018.
If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase by   ` 85 crores (decrease by ` 80 crores) as at March 31, 2018.
The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit  obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the  assumption may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has  been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that  applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
Each year an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment  policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles.
Investment and contribution policies are integrated within  this study.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  203  The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2018 as follows: (` crores) Year ending March 31, Defined benefit  obligations 2019 225 2020 211 2021 218 2022 216 2023 216 Thereafter 867  Provident fund  In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under  the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly  to a Trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees.
This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which  should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund.
A part of the  Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund.
The contributions made by the  Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit  expenses.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by   Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest  cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be  credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered  provident fund.
The details of fund and plan assets are given below: (` crores) As at                               March 31, 2018 As at                               March 31, 2017 Fair value of plan assets 13,084 10,962 Present value of defined benefit obligation (13,084) (10,962) Net (shortfall) / excess   -   -  The plan assets have been primarily invested in Government securities and corporate bonds.
The principal assumptions used in determining the present value obligation of interest guarantee under the  deterministic approach are as follows: As at                               March 31, 2018 As at                               March 31, 2017 Discount rate 7.75% 7.25% Average remaining tenure of investment portfolio 7.95 years 7.01 years Guaranteed rate of return 8.55% 8.65%  The Company contributed ` 795 crores (March 31, 2017: ` 756 crores) to the provident fund during the year ended  March 31, 2018.

Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  207  Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled revenues, loans and trade payables as at  March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 approximate the fair value.
Difference between carrying amounts and fair values  of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets, other financial liabilities and borrowings  subsequently measured at amortised cost is not significant in each of the years presented.
Fair value hierarchy  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either  observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:  Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined  in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
The financial instruments included in Level 2 of fair value hierarchy have been valued using quotes available for  similar assets and liabilities in the active market.
The investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy have  been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value.
The cost of unquoted investments approximate the  fair value because there is a range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value  within that range.
The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and financial  assets that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosure are required): (` crores) As at March 31, 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets Mutual fund units  9,101  59  -    9,160  Equity shares  -    -    3  3  Government securities  23,218  -    -    23,218  Corporate bonds  -    2,754  -    2,754  Derivative financial assets  -    89  -    89  Total  32,319  2,902  3  35,224  Financial liabilities Derivative financial liabilities  -    91  -    91  Total            -  91            -  91   (` crores) As at March 31, 2017 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets Mutual fund units  18,785  -    -    18,785  Equity shares  -    -    22  22  Government securities  21,999  -    -    21,999  Derivative financial assets  -    572  -    572  Total  40,784  572  22  41,378  Financial liabilities Derivative financial liabilities  -    20  -    20  Total            -  20            -  20  Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 208 I  Unconsolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18  Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement is as follows: (` crores) As at                               March 31, 2018 As at  March 31, 2017 Balance at the beginning of the year  22  47  Impairment during the year  (19)  -    Disposals during the year  -    (25) Balance at the end of the year  3  22  (b) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity  The Company’s revenue is denominated in foreign currency predominantly US Dollar, Sterling Pound and Euro.
In  addition to these currencies, the Company also does business in Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc,  Japanese Yen, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona, South African Rand, Singapore Dollar, Saudi Arabian Riyal,   Danish Kroner and Brazilian Real.
Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in  Indian Rupee.
This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.
The Board of Directors of the Company has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement  and monitor the risk management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to  foreign currency fluctuations.
Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various  derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options contracts and futures contracts in which  the counter party is generally a bank.

Although these contracts are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, they do not qualify for hedge  accounting.
Exchange loss for the year ended March 31, 2018 of ` 52 crores (March 31, 2017: Exchange gain of ` 1,522 crores) on  foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts has been recognised in the statement of profit  and loss.
Net foreign exchange gains include loss of ` 213 crores (March 31, 2017: Net gain of ` 508 crores) transferred from  cash flow hedging reserve for the year ended March 31, 2018.
Net loss on derivative instruments of ` 71 crores recognised in Hedging Reserve as at March 31, 2018, is expected to  be transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2019.
The maximum period over which the exposure  of cash flow variability has been hedged is through calendar year of 2018.
Following table summarises approximate gain / (loss) on the Company’s other comprehensive income on account of  appreciation / depreciation of the underlying foreign currencies.

The Company has a risk  management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities.
The risk management policy  is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability  of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.
(i) Market risk  Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in market prices.
Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the   foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.
The Company’s exposure  to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 210 I  Unconsolidated Financial Statements Annual Report 2017-18  (a) Foreign currency exchange rate risk   The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or  where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are  subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.
The risks primarily relate to  fluctuations in US Dollar, Great Britain Pound and Euro against the functional currency of the Company.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign  exchange.
Further, any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against  major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.
The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange  rate risks.
It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management  policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure  and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional  currency of the Company.
The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of  balance sheet which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.
Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the  Company as disclosed in note 29(b).
The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2018: (` crores)  USD  GBP  EUR  Others*  Total  Total financial assets  3,783  944  431  1,218  6,376  Total financial liabilities  3,077  761  323  541  4,702   10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the  Company would result in decrease / increase in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately ` 168 crores  for the year ended March 31, 2018.
The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2017: (` crores)  USD  GBP  EUR  Others*  Total  Total financial assets  2,544  815  214  1,227  4,800  Total financial liabilities  2,225  620  237  599  3,681    10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the  Company would result in decrease / increase in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately ` 112 crores  for the year ended March 31, 2017.
*Others include Australian Dollar, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Danish Kroner, Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso,   United Arab Emirates Dirham, Swedish Kroner, South African Rand, Swiss Franc, Norwegian Kroner etc.
(b) Interest rate risk   The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments.
Hence the Company is not  significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
(ii) Credit risk  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to  the contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of  deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits  and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining  necessary approvals for credit.
Notes forming part of the Financial Statements Unconsolidated Financial Statements I  211  Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, unbilled  revenue, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial  assets.
Inter-corporate deposits of ` 4,000 crores are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned  by credit-rating agencies.
Bank deposits include an amount of ` 2,000 crores held with an Indian bank having high  quality credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits for the  year ended March 31, 2018.
None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration  of credit risk.
Exposure to credit risk  The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit  risk was ` 68,711 crores and ` 67,749 crores as at March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively, being the  total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference  investments, trade receivables, unbilled revenue and other financial assets.
The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of  outstanding trade receivable and unbilled revenue as at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
Geographic concentration of credit risk  Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and unbilled revenue is as follows: As at March 31, 2018 As at March 31, 2017 Gross % Net % Gross % Net % United States of America  39.37 40.41 37.07 38.03 India 19.47 17.87 21.01 19.48 United Kingdom 17.18 17.35 17.31 17.47  Geographical concentration of trade receivables and unbilled revenue is allocated based on the location of the  customers.
(iii) Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations.
The objective of liquidity risk  management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.
The Company consistently generated sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its financial obligations as and  when they fall due.

TCS is pioneering the location independent model  of Agile, that allows for deployment at scale, and helps customers whose own organizations  are globally distributed to execute large transformational programs quickly while ensuring  stability and quality AI See Artificial Intelligence Amortisation Amortisation is an accounting concept similar to depreciation, but used to measure the  consumption of intangible assets such as, acquired customer relationships and contracts, etc Analytics In the enterprise context, this is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful  patterns in business data to predict and improve business performance APAC Acronym for Asia Pacific API See Application Programming Interface APIfication The process of exposing a discrete business function or data within an enterprise’s systems  through APIs Application  Development and  Maintenance Design, development, and deployment of custom software; ongoing support, upkeep, and  enhancement of such software over its lifetime Application  Programming Interface  APIs are a set of easily accessible protocols for communication between various software  components AR See Augmented Reality Artificial Intelligence AI is technology that appears to emulate human performance typically by learning, coming to  its own conclusions, appearing to understand complex content, engaging in natural dialogs  with people, augmenting human effort or replacing people on execution of non-routine tasks.
Also known as Cognitive Computing Asset Leveraged  Solutions  Software solutions delivered by leveraging TCS’ IP / frameworks or software products Assurance Services Quality Assurance and Engineering Services encompassing business requirements validation,  static and functional testing, non-functional testing including performance engineering, user  experience, security and test automation Attrition This measures what portion of the workforce left the organization (voluntarily or involuntarily)  in a certain period.
Attrition looks at employee departures over the last 12 months (LTM).
The  formula is: Total number of departures in the LTM / closing headcount Augmented Reality Augmented Reality is a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user’s  view of the real world to enrich the interaction Glossary Glossary I 221 Automation Automation is the execution of work by machines in accordance with rules that have either  been explicitly coded by a human or ‘learned’ by the machine through pattern recognition of  data Basis Point A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point, that is, 0.01% Bp See Basis Point BFSI Acronym for Banking, Financial Services and Insurance Big Data Big Data is high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require  new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery, and process  optimization Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records,  called blocks, secured from tampering and revision BPaaS See Business Process as a Service BPS See Business Process Services Business 4.0 Business 4.0 is TCS’ thought leadership framework that helps enterprises leverage technology  to further their growth and transformation agenda.
Successful enterprises in the Business 4.0  epoch are ones which use technology to deliver mass personalization, leverage ecosystems,  embrace risk and create exponential value.
Such enterprises are agile, intelligent, automated  and on the cloud Business Process as a  Service BPaaS refers to the delivery of BPS over a cloud computing model.
Whereas the aim of  traditional BPS is to reduce labor costs, BPaaS reduces labor count through increased  automation, thereby cutting costs in the process.
The pricing models are consumption-based  or subscription-based commercial terms.
As a cloud service, the BPaaS model is accessed via  Internet-based technologies Business Process  Services Designing, enabling, and executing business operations including data management, analytics,  interactions and experience management Buy-back Buy-Back is a corporate action in which a company buys back its shares from the existing  shareholders and subsequently extinguishes them.
The number of shares outstanding in the  market correspondingly reduces CAGR See Compounded Annual Growth Rate CBO See Cognitive Business Operations CC See Constant Currency Chatbots Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users,  especially over the internet.
They are typically used in dialog systems for various practical  purposes like customer service or information acquisition Cloud See Cloud Computing Cloud Computing Cloud computing is the delivery of easily provisionable computing resources – servers, storage,  databases, networking, software, analytics and more – over the Internet, consumed on a pay- as-you-go basis.
CMT Acronym for Communication, Media and Technology Cognitive Business  Operations CBO refers to TCS’ integrated offering consisting of BPS and IT IS, where TCS takes responsibility  for the process outcomes, and uses cognitive automation to deliver superior outcomes Cognitive Computing See Artificial Intelligence COIN See Co-Innovation Network 222 I Glossary Annual Report 2017-18 Co-Innovation Network TCS uses COIN to harness the innovation taking place within the start-up ecosystem, including  venture capitalists and academia globally, and incorporating them into innovative solutions  for customers Compounded Annual  Growth Rate CAGR is a useful measure of growth over multiple time periods.
It can be thought of as the  growth rate between any two points in time, assuming that the metric has been compounding  during that period Constant Currency Restating the current period’s transactions in the reporting currency using the exchange rates  of other currencies to reporting currency of a prior period.
Eliminating the impact of movement  in exchange rates over two periods provides a better basis for analyzing performance over  periods.
At TCS, revenue and profit performance are discussed in constant currency while  analyzing performance Core Banking System Core banking system is a back-end system that processes daily banking transactions and posts  updates to accounts and other financial records.
Core banking systems typically include deposit,  loan and credit processing capabilities, with interfaces to general ledger systems and reporting  tools Cyber Security Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks,  computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.
In a computing  context, security includes both cybersecurity and physical security Days’ Sales Outstanding Days’ Sales Outstanding is a popular way of depicting the Trade Receivable relative to the  company’s Revenue.
(DSO = Trade Receivable * 365 / Revenue) Dedicated servers Dedicated servers are geared toward single tenants.
Typically, companies with business-critical  operations that demand high performance plus strict regulatory compliance rely on dedicated  servers Depreciation Depreciation is a method of allocating the cost of a tangible long-term asset over its useful life.
It is a non-cash accounting entry found in the statement of profit and loss DevOps Traditional methods of software development, which work in phases and are milestone  focused, make it hard to keep up with today’s time-to-market demands.
DevOps represents a  new way of working to build and deliver software.
DevOps uses high levels of automation and  tooling to rapidly deploy the software in production.
DevOps, alongwith Agile has enabled  TCS to achieve speed to market Digital Digital is a phrase used to represent new age technologies such as Social Media, Mobility,  Analytics, Big Data, Cloud, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Discretionary Spend Discretionary spend, also known as Change the Business (CTB) spend, is that portion of the  IT budget which is used to fund projects that are not, strictly speaking, essential for day to  day operations, but are more transformational in nature.
In uncertain economic times, when  businesses are forced to cut spends in response to decline in income, discretionary spend is  often the first to be scrutinized.
What is considered discretionary is subjective and may differ  considerably amongst businesses Dividend Dividend is one form of distribution of profits earned by the Company and is usually declared  as an amount per equity share held by the Shareholders.
TCS has a policy of declaring quarterly  interim dividends and the final dividend is approved by the shareholders in the Annual General  Meeting Dividend Payout Ratio Dividend Payout Ratio is the ratio of the annual dividend paid (including dividend distribution  tax) to the Net Income, usually expressed as a percentage Earnings per Share EPS for any period is the amount of that period’s Net Income attributable to a single share  after deducting any preference dividend and related taxes EPS = [Net profit – Preference dividend if any] / Weighted average number of shares  outstanding during the period Glossary I 223 Effective Tax Rate ETR is the proportion of the Profit Before Taxes that is provided towards income taxes ETR = Provision for Taxes / Profit Before Taxes Effort Effort is the work performed by an employee, measured by the time spent on various tasks as  entered by the employee in a timesheet.
The smallest measure of effort is a person-hour which  is the work performed by one person for one hour.
In very large projects which might entail  a few hundred or even a few thousand team-members working over a long period, the effort  measured in person-hours can become unwieldy so more convenient units such as person-days,  person-weeks, person-months or person-years might be used.
In every case, it refers to the  work performed by one person for one unit of time.
With greater use of automation, and  newer contracting models, the link between revenue earned and effort expended is gradually  weakening.
Engineering and  Industrial Services Next Generation Product Engineering, Manufacturing Operations Transformation, Services  Transformation, Embedded software and Internet of Things Enterprise Solutions  and Consulting Business and technology consulting, design, architecture, implementation, and support services  on Enterprise Application platforms covering the front, middle, and back-office applications  such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supply  Chain, Content Management etc., on-premise, cloud and other digital platforms EPS See Earnings Per Share ETR See Effective Tax rate Fixed Price Contracts This is a form of services contract where the vendor takes a turnkey responsibility for delivering  a solution for a certain price and within a mutually agreed timeframe.
The customer is billed  on completion of key project milestones and related deliverables.
This arrangement gives the  vendor considerable flexibility in the staffing and execution of the project.
On the other hand,  it also means bearing the project risk.
Fair Value The fair value of a financial asset or liability is the price that would be received on selling an  asset or paid on transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  at the measurement date Forward Contract A Forward Contract is a hedging instrument wherein two parties agree to buy or sell a particular  currency at a pre-determined rate (OR Forward Currency rate) on a specific future date.
For e.g.
TCS enters into a forward contract to sell USD 1mn after 3 months @ `68.
Irrespective  of the prevailing USDINR spot rate, TCS will be obliged to sell USD 1mn @ `68 at the end of 3  months Gamification Gamification is the process of adding games or game-like elements to any activity in order to  enrich experiences and encourage user participation Hybrid Cloud A hybrid cloud combines private clouds, public clouds and single-tenant dedicated servers.
The  private cloud offers advanced security, the public cloud provides scalability, and the single- tenant dedicated servers offer superior performance for applications that require it IT IS See IT Infrastructure Services IT Infrastructure  Services  Technical consulting, remote infrastructure management, hosting, process and tools  optimization, and technical transformation of the enterprise IT infrastructure to a future proof  hybrid cloud model IaaS See Infrastructure as a Service Infrastructure as a  Service IaaS is a method of delivering computing, storage, networking and other capabilities via the  Internet.
IaaS enables companies to utilize web-based operating systems, applications and  storage without having to purchase, manage and support the underlying cloud infrastructure IoT See Internet of Things 224 I Glossary Annual Report 2017-18 Internet of Things IoT is a network of interconnected machines or devices which are embedded with sensors,  software, network connectivity, and necessary electronics to generate and share run-time data  that can be studied and used to monitor or control remotely, predict failure, and optimize the  design of those machines / devices Invested Funds Invested funds are funds that are highly liquid in nature, and can be readily converted into  cash.
Invested Funds = Cash and Bank Balances + Investments + Deposits with Banks + Inter  corporate Deposits KMP See Key Managerial Personnel Key Managerial  Personnel KMP at TCS refers to the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Chief Operating  Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Global Head – Human Resources and the Company Secretary.
Please refer to the Company’s policy on KMP: http://www.tcs.com/ir-corporate-governance LatAm Acronym for Latin America Geography Machine Learning Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to  learn without being explicitly programmed Market Capitalization Total market value of all of a company’s outstanding equity shares Market Cap = Last Trading Price * Total number of outstanding shares MEA Acronym for Middle East and Africa Geography Mobility Mobility means information, convenience, and social media all combined together, and made  available across a variety of screen sizes and devices Non controlling  Interest Non controlling Interest is the share of the consolidated profits attributable to interests of the  non-controlling ownership in the subsidiaries Non-discretionary  Spend Non-Discretionary spend, also known as Run the Business (RTB) spend, is that portion of the IT  budget that covers the basic IT activities required to keep a business running Even in tough economic times, non-discretionary spend remains relatively unaffected PaaS See Platform as a Service Platform as a Service PaaS, is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow  developers to build applications and services over the internet.
PaaS services are hosted in the  cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser Personalization Segmentation and responding to individual transactions, customised for a single customer in  a single instance Pricing This is the price charged to the customer per unit of effort.
In Time and Material contracts,  pricing is the billing rate for a unit of effort (usually measured in person-hours).
In Fixed Price  contracts, pricing is the total sum the customer is expected to pay for the turnkey solution  delivered.
Some use this term interchangeably (and somewhat inaccurately) with the average revenue  realized by the company per unit of effort.
See Realization Private Cloud A private cloud offers the agility, scalability and efficiency of the public cloud, with the greater  levels of control and security of a single-tenant, dedicated server environment.
It can be  hosted on-site at your own data center or at a service provider’s data center.
When securing  your business data or regulatory compliance is paramount, it’s an ideal choice Public Cloud Public cloud provides easy access to IT resources as you need them and when you need them,  reducing the cost and burden of ongoing hardware and datacenter management.
A public  cloud has multiple tenants and offers pay-as-you-go scalability.
It’s well suited for websites  with public-facing operations and unpredictable or heavy traffic Glossary I 225 Realization This is the revenue received by the company per unit of effort expended.
TCS reports the year  on year change in realization (in percentage terms) after removing any impact of changes in  currency exchange rates.
Billing rates vary depending on what service is offered and in which country, so it is  important to note that increases or decreases in realization could be because of changes in  the underlying business or geographic mix and not necessarily because of a change in pricing.
Also, realization doesn’t take into account the costs and therefore higher realization is not  necessarily better or more profitable Related Party  Transactions Any transaction between a company and its related party involving transfer of services,  resources or any obligation, regardless of whether a price is charged.
Please refer the Company’s policy on Related Party Transactions : http://www.tcs.com/ir- corporate-governance Revenue Revenue is the income earned by the company from operations by providing IT & consulting  services, software licenses, and hardware equipment to customers RPA See Robotic Process Automation Robotic Process  Automation RPA is the use of software with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities  to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform.
These  tasks can include queries, calculations and maintenance of records and transactions.
SMB See Small and Mid-sized Businesses SEZ See Special Economic Zone Simplification Simplification is the term used to describe the rationalization of IT architectures through  consolidation of systems and elimination of redundant systems and layers.
The primary purpose  is to shrink the IT footprint and make operations leaner and more efficient Small and Mid-sized  Businesses SMB is a business which, due to its size, has different IT requirements—and often faces different  IT challenges—than large enterprises, and whose IT resources (usually budget and staff) are  often highly constrained Social Media Social media is an online environment where content is created, consumed, promoted,  distributed, discovered or shared for purposes that are primarily related to communities and  social activities rather than to functional, task-oriented objectives.
“Media,” in this context,  represents an environment characterized by storage and transmission, while “social” describes  the distinct way these messages propagate in a one-to-many or many-to-many fashion Special Economic Zone SEZ in India were developed as areas in which business and trade laws are different from  the rest of the country offering them various benefits and tax breaks with the objective of  promoting exports from the country, increase trade, and investment, and help in job creation STEM STEM is an acronym for education in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math Trade Receivable This is the sum of all the invoices outstanding at the end of the period.
To get a complete  picture of the total outstanding, one can also add the Unbilled Revenues where invoices are  yet to be raised for services already delivered and subtract the Unearned Revenues where  invoices have been raised for services that are yet to be delivered.
Trade Receivable is normally  viewed in proportion to the size of the organization’s revenue and so it is expressed as Days’  Sales Outstanding or DSO T&M See Time and Materials Contracts Time and Material  Contracts This is a form of services contract where the customer is billed for the time (hours, days, weeks,  etc) logged by the project team members .
In other words, the customer is billed for the effort  rather than for the outcomes.
Project risk is borne by the customer.
This is in contrast to Fixed  Price Contracts Turnkey Contracts See Fixed Price Contracts 226 I Glossary Annual Report 2017-18 UBR See Unbilled Revenue Unbilled Revenue UBR is revenue that is yet to be invoiced for services already delivered.
Typically invoicing  in turnkey projects are tied to achieving agreed milestones.
UBR arises when the efforts are  expended during the course of achieving such milestones and when the contract provides  for right to receive payment for effort expended until the milestone is achieved.
This is the  opposite of Unearned Revenue UER See Unearned Revenue Unearned Revenue UER is invoice raised in advance for services yet to be delivered.
In other words, it is the amount  that has been invoiced although the underlying effort is yet to be expended.
Unearned  revenue is the opposite of Unbilled Revenue VR See Virtual Reality Virtual Reality VR is an artificial, computer-generated simulation or recreation of a real life environment or  situation.
It engages users by offering simulated reality experiences firsthand, primarily by  stimulating their vision and hearing Virtualization Virtualization is the abstraction of IT resources – like a server, client, storage or network – that  masks the physical nature and boundaries of those resources from the users of those resources Volume Volume in any period is the Effort expended and the quantum of hardware equipment and  software licenses sold in that period Y-o-Y Acronym for Year-on-Year Disclaimer:  This glossary is intended to help understand commonly used terms and phrases in this Report.
