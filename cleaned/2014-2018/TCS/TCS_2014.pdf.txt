Foreign currency forward, option and futures  contracts TCS enters into foreign currency forward, option and  futures contracts to manage its exposure to exchange  rate ﬂuctuations, in accordance with its risk management  policies.
With effect from January 1, 2014, the Company has  adopted hedge accounting principles in line with  International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (referred to  as IFRS 9), which align more closely with the Company’s  risk management policy.
This change will reduce the  volatility in the Company’s reported quarterly profit  or loss, resulting from the change in the time value of  hedging instruments.
In accordance with this principle,  the change in the time value of hedging instrument is  accumulated under hedging reserve, a component of  reserves and surplus and is recognised in proﬁt or loss  when the forecasted transaction occurs.
The change has  resulted in a reduction of ` 4.76 crores in proﬁt before  tax in ﬁscal 2014.
Foreign currency forward, option and futures contracts  outstanding at the reporting dates, other than designated  cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at their respective fair values  and the resultant gains or losses are accounted as other  income in the proﬁt and loss account for the period.

As a percentage of revenue, PBT  increased from 28.72% in ﬁscal 2013 to 31.05% in ﬁscal  2014.
The increase of 2.33% is mainly due to (1) increase  in EBITDA 2.11%, (2) increase in other income 0.13% and  (3) decrease in depreciation & amortisation 0.06%.
Management Discussion and Analysis46 Annual Report 2013-14 Tax expense Tax expense increased from ` 4,014.04 crores in ﬁscal 2013  to ` 6,069.99 crores in ﬁscal 2014.
As a percentage of  revenue, it increased from 6.37% in ﬁscal 2013 to 7.42%  in ﬁscal 2014.
The effective tax rate has increased from  22.19% in ﬁscal 2013 to 23.90% in ﬁscal 2014, primarily on  account of (1) increase in corporate tax rate in India due  to increase in surcharge from 5% in ﬁscal 2013 to 10% in  ﬁscal 2014 and (2) some of the SEZ units losing status of  full exemption on expiry of ﬁve years.
Provisions of minimum alternative tax (MAT) under the IT  Act were applicable to the Company’s income excluding  its income from SEZ.
With effect from April 1, 2011, MAT  became applicable to income from SEZ also.
Payment of  MAT results in tax credit which according to the IT Act  can be carried forward for subsequent ten years and  adjusted against future tax liabilities.
In the view of the  Company, it would have sufﬁcient tax liabilities to offset  the MAT credits during the prescribed carry forward  period.
Accordingly, MAT has been recognised as an asset  in the balance sheet.
Minority interest Minority interest registered a marginal increase from  ` 158.38 crores in ﬁscal 2013 to ` 168.00 crores in ﬁscal  2014, primarily due to higher profits in the relevant  subsidiaries.

The increase of 1.34% in  terms of revenue is attributable to increase in PBT 2.33%  partially offset by higher taxes of 1.05%.

Most  BFSI companies continue to seek strategic transformation  and simpliﬁcation of technology and business processes  to increase agility, enhance customer experience and  future-proof operations.
Risk management and regulatory  compliance will continue to be in the spotlight with  significant resource and fund allocations.
As digital  technologies continue to redeﬁne and blur boundaries  between industries, banks are utilising these to create  innovative products and services to enhance customer  experience.
Several initiatives are underway to de-layer and rationalise  application landscape as well as infrastructure with  focused investments in modernisation of key platforms  such as lending, deposits, policy administration, claims  and billing.
The industry continues to commit signiﬁcant  resources to IT security.
In addition, banks are likely to  invest in collecting and analysing data from enterprise  systems and non-traditional sources such as social media,  usage based insurance devices and service channels for  smarter business decisions and better customer insights.
TCS has enabled offerings to meet the digital demand.
It  has partnered with industry experts to drive automation  based cost savings for banks and has made signiﬁcant  investments to engage and deepen European customer  relationships.

A new trend is emerging among telcos to transform  themselves so as to address the non-core areas like  enterprise mobility, information & communication  technology (ICT) services and multipoint to multipoint  (M2M) communication among small & medium businesses  (SMB).
Media and information services industry continues  to march on its journey of digital metamorphosis, a  transformation from primarily physical products to  largely digital products and services businesses.
Different  segments within the industry are at different stages in  this transformation.
This ﬁscal, we saw the information  services industry leaders reporting their digital revenues  to be upwards of 50% of overall business and positive  organic revenue growth.

The industry has been engaging itself in business  transformation to digital technologies prompted by  rapid consumer adoption of mobile devices, consumer  activism in digital media and behavioral shift to ‘anytime  anywhere’ shopping.
In addition to building the  future digital enterprise, retailers are also focusing on  modernising their legacy systems and simplifying the  business processes and IT landscape, preventing risks of  security breach and investing in building efﬁcient systems.
This segment continues to invest in consumer analytics,  digital commerce and business intelligence apart from  strengthening traditional technology capabilities.
This  fiscal saw strong engagement with big customers on  enterprise mobility, disruptive technologies, supply chain  and cloud.

Life sciences and healthcare The pharmaceutical industry continues to undergo  significant changes to its business model due to the  Management Discussion and Analysis50 Annual Report 2013-14 increased cost pressure owing to patent cliff, increased  regulations and constrained budgets for R&D.
As the  industry shifts from a mass-market to a target-market  approach, there is an increased focus on compliance,  transparency and adoption of fair practices.
This changed  scenario has led companies to focus on various ways to  expand their market, to reduce cost and to bring new  drugs to the market faster.
The medical devices and the  biotech markets are going to be the primary growth  DRIVERS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THESE ARE LIKELY TO EXHIBIT  higher growth than that of the pharmaceutical market.
Healthcare reform legislation, cost containment pressures  and the shift from traditional group based business models  to a consumer based model are driving unprecedented  changes in the healthcare industry, driving healthcare  payers and providers to increase agility by modernising  legacy systems and processes and increased cloud  adoption.
Accountable care organisations (ACO) and  health exchanges (HIX) are contributing to the move away  from the traditional “Payer” and “Provider” distinctions  towards “Wellness and Prevention”.
The Company’s strong domain knowledge, process  outsourcing and technology expertise has enabled it to  effectively serve its customers across the value chain.
TCS  has also made signiﬁcant contribution towards making its  customers aware, adapt and leverage new technologies  like mobility, big data, digital marketing etc.
to expand  and optimise their businesses.
Hi-tech The hi-tech industry experienced a rebound across its  segments during fiscal 2014.
The computer hardware  and electronics segment maintained its growth  momentum for smart phones and tablets over traditional  personal computers.
This in turn helped growth in the  semiconductor segment as demonstrated by the strong  PERFORMANCE IN THE MEMORY SECTOR $2!- .

Signiﬁcant momentum in infrastructure services, business  process services and enterprise solutions helped drive  growth in this segment.
There has been an increased  demand for vendor consolidation services, transformational  projects, engineering and R&D outsourcing services.
The  hi-tech industry has been making large investments in  new technologies, platforms, solutions and segment  speciﬁc offerings to address the challenges.
The Company has won large deals in existing client  portfolio and added new customers in major as well as  emerging geographies.
Energy, resources & utilities Fundamentals of oil and gas, oil ﬁeld services, mining,  metals and engineering, procurement and construction   (EPC) industry remain sound.
However behavior such  as cutbacks in staff, delays in projects and cost savings  initiatives are turning up around the industry.
Factors like  supply demand balance, exploding operating costs, capital  project overload, cost of delivery, activist government  creating uncertainty contribute significantly to the  challenges faced.
Uncertainty may lengthen decision cycle  time as customers are turning cautious and looking for  reduced costs.
Given this industry context, a number of new themes  are emerging in the area of customer service with  an increased preference for engaging single vendor  managing (i) transformation, (ii) inter-regional supply  chain management and (iii) single template for execution  systems.
The power sector is on the verge of a historical  transformation.
Consumer empowerment and blurring  of industry boundaries is resulting in competition  from outside the industry.
Demand response, energy  efficiency, data from smart meters and digitalisation  provides potential to enhance customer experience,  create new products & services and make ﬁeld force more  empowered and intelligent.
Regulation is also driving  changes in utilities.
In water industry, leakage reduction  and environmental protection are topmost priority.
Utilities across the globe are going through a sequence  of mergers and acquisition needing rationalisation and  simpliﬁcation of their technology landscape.
In order to stay relevant to our customers, we have  aligned our strategy of “Simpliﬁcation, Digital enterprise  and Governance” to customer’s IT landscape and are  engaging with them to help take cost out, plough back  some of the savings into investments for digital projects  and help them in area of risk, reliability and predictability.

2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of preparation   These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in India  under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain ﬁnancial instruments which are measured at fair  value.
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared to comply in all material aspects with the accounting standards  notiﬁed under Section 211(3C) (which continues to be applicable in terms of General circular 15/2013 dated September  13, 2013 of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in respect of Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013) and other relevant  provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. b) Principles of consolidation   The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiary companies used in the consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting date as  of the Company.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the following basis:   i) The ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies have been combined on a line-by-line basis by  adding together like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Inter-company balances and transactions and  unrealised proﬁts or losses have been fully eliminated.
ii) The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the share of proﬁt / loss of associate companies, which are accounted  under the ‘Equity method’ as per which the share of proﬁt / loss of the associate company has been adjusted to the  cost of investment.
An associate is an enterprise in which the investor has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and which is neither a  subsidiary nor a joint venture.
iii) The excess of the cost to the parent of its investments in a subsidiary over the parent’s portion of equity at the date  on which investment in the subsidiary is made, is recognised as ‘Goodwill (on consolidation)’.
When the cost to the  parent of its investment in a subsidiary is less than the parent’s portion of equity of the subsidiary at the date on  which investment in the subsidiary is made, the difference is treated as ‘Capital Reserve (on consolidation)’ in the  consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
iv) Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries consists of the amount of equity attributable to the  minority shareholders at the dates on which investments in the subsidiary companies are made and further movements  in their share in the equity, subsequent to the dates of investments.
v) On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss  on disposal.
c) Use of estimates   The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires the management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date of   the ﬁnancial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the year.
Examples of such estimates include  provision for doubtful receivables, employee beneﬁts, provision for income taxes, accounting for contract costs expected  to be incurred, the useful lives of depreciable ﬁxed assets and provision for impairment.
Future results could differ due to  changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual result and the estimates are recognised in the period in  which the results are known/materialise.
d) Fixed Assets   Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation/amortisation.
Costs include all expenses incurred to bring the   assets to its present location and condition.
Fixed assets exclude computers and other assets individually costing ` 50,000 or less which are not capitalised except when  they are part of a larger capital investment programme.
Consolidated Financial Statements 109 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements e) Depreciation/Amortisation   Depreciation/amortisation on ﬁxed assets other than on freehold land and capital work-in-progress is charged so as to  write-off the cost of the assets, on the following basis: Type of asset Method Rate / Period Leasehold land and buildings Straight line Lease period Freehold buildings Written down value 5.00% Straight line 1.63% - 2.50% Factory buildings Straight line 10.00% Leasehold improvements Straight line Lease period Plant and machinery Straight line 33.33% Computer equipment Straight line 10% - 50% Vehicles Written down value 25.89% Straight line 9.50% - 33.33% Ofﬁce equipment Written down value 13.91% Straight line 4.75% - 33.33% Electrical installations Written down value 13.91% Straight line 6.63% - 33.33% Furniture and ﬁxtures Straight line 6.63% - 100% Goodwill Straight line 12 years Acquired contract rights Straight line 12 years Intellectual property / distribution rights Straight line 24 - 60 months Software licenses Straight line License period Straight line 20% - 50% Rights under licensing agreement Straight line License period   Fixed assets purchased for speciﬁc projects are depreciated over the period of the project.
f) Leases   Where the Group, as a lessor, leases assets under ﬁnance lease, such amounts are recognised as receivables at an amount  equal to the net investment in the lease and the ﬁnance income is based on a constant rate of return on the outstanding  net investment.
Assets taken on lease by the Group in its capacity as lessee, where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance lease.
Such leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at lower of the fair value  or the present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised for an equivalent amount.
Each lease  rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability for each year.
Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vests with the lessor, are  recognised as operating lease.
Lease rentals under operating lease are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss on a  straight-line basis.
g) Impairment   At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating  unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.
Recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows expected  from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount  rate that reﬂects the current market assessments of time value of money and risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to  beneﬁt from the synergies of acquisition.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for  impairment annually or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.
If the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying  amount of goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying  amount of each asset in the unit.
h) Investments   Long-term investments and current maturities of long-term investments are stated at cost, less provision for other than  temporary diminution in value.
Current investments, except for current maturities of long term investments, are stated at  the lower of cost and fair value.
Consolidated Financial Statements110 Annual Report 2013-14 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements i) Employee beneﬁts i) Post-employment beneﬁt plans    Contributions to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are recognised as expense when employees have  rendered services entitling them to such beneﬁts.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full  in the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period in which they occur.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to  the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested or amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the  beneﬁts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt  obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any  asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future  contributions to the scheme.
ii) Other employee beneﬁts    The undiscounted amount of short-term employee beneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered  by employees is recognised during the period when the employee renders the service.
These beneﬁts include  compensated absences such as paid annual leave, overseas social security contributions and performance incentives.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which  the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of  the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date.
j) Revenue recognition   Revenue from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs  are incurred.
Revenue from turnkey contracts, which are generally time bound ﬁxed price contracts, are recognised over the life of  the contract using the proportionate completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion.
Foreseeable losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenue from the sale of equipments are recognised upon delivery, which is when the title passes to the customer.
Revenue from sale of software licenses are recognised upon delivery.
Revenue from maintenance contracts are recognised on pro-rata basis over the period of the contract.
In respect of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services, revenue on time and material and unit priced contracts  is recognised as the related services are rendered, whereas revenue from ﬁxed price contracts is recognised using the  proportionate completion method with contract cost determining the degree of completion.
Revenue is reported net of discounts.
Dividend is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on time proportion  basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
k) Taxation   Current income tax expense comprises taxes on income from operations in India and in foreign jurisdictions.
Income tax  payable in India is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Tax expense relating to  foreign operations is determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are domiciled.
Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which gives rise to future economic beneﬁts  in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability, is considered as an asset if there is convincing evidence that the  Company and its Indian subsidiaries will pay normal income tax after the tax holiday period.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised  as an asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt  associated with it will fructify.
Deferred tax expense or beneﬁt is recognised on timing differences being the difference between taxable income and  accounting income that originate in one period and is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax  assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the  balance sheet date.
In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent  that there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available  to realise such assets.
In other situations, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable  certainty that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available to realise these assets.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid  and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the Group is able to  and intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
The Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right and these relate to taxes  on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
Consolidated Financial Statements 111 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements l) Foreign currency transactions   Income and expense in foreign currencies are converted at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency monetary assets and liabilities other than net investments in non-integral foreign operations are translated at  the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and the exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement  of proﬁt and loss.
Exchange difference arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of an enterprise’s net  investments in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.
Premium or discount on foreign currency forward, option and futures contracts are amortised and recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss over the period of the contract.
Foreign exchange forward, currency option and future  contracts outstanding at the balance sheet date, other than designated cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at fair values and any  gains or losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
For the purpose of consolidation, income and expenses are translated at average rates and the assets and liabilities are  stated at closing rate.
The net impact of such change is accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve.
m) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting   The Group uses foreign currency forward, option and futures contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency  ﬂuctuations relating to certain ﬁrm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Group designates these hedging  instruments as cash ﬂow hedges.
The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide  written principles on the use of such ﬁnancial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy.
Hedging instruments are initially measured at fair value, and are remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in  the fair value of these derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised directly  in shareholders’ funds and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The Group  separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments, only the fair value change  in the intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair value of the time value of option, which was previously recognised  immediately in statement of proﬁt and loss, is now accumulated in hedging reserve, a component of shareholders’ funds  and is classiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecast transaction occurs.
This change in accounting for time  value of an option has resulted in a reduction in proﬁt before tax of ` 4.76 crores for the year ended March 31, 2014.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualiﬁes for hedge accounting.
Cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in shareholders’ funds  is retained there and is classiﬁed to statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ funds is transferred  to the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period.
n) Inventories   Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined  on a weighted average basis.
Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of cost  and net realisable value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods  produced or purchased by the Group are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material  and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.
o) Government grants   Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions  attached to them and the grants will be received.
Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire capital  assets are presented by deducting them from the carrying value of the assets.
The grant is recognised as income over the  life of a depreciable asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
Other government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs for which they  are intended to compensate, on a systematic and rational basis.
p) Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets   A provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable that an  outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions  (excluding retirement beneﬁts) are not discounted to its present value and are determined based on best estimate required  to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reﬂect the  current best estimates.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
A contingent asset is neither  recognised nor disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements.
q) Cash and cash equivalents   The Group considers all highly liquid ﬁnancial instruments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that  are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of change in value and having original maturities of three months or less from the date  of purchase, to be cash equivalents.

Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audit.

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the  accounting estimates made by the Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Bhatt Rajesh Gopinathan Director Director Chief Financial Ofﬁcer Suprakash Mukhopadhyay Company SecretaryMumbai, April 16, 2014 Mumbai, April 16, 2 014 Unconsolidated Financial Statements 149 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements 1) CORPORATE INFORMATION Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS Limited” or “the Company”) provide consulting-led integrated portfolio  of information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services delivered through a network of multiple locations around the globe.
The Company’s full services portfolio consists of IT and Assurance Services, Business Intelligence and Performance Management,  Business Process Services, Cloud Services, Connected Marketing Solutions, Consulting, Eco-sustainability Services, Engineering  and Industrial Services, Enterprise Security and Risk Management, Enterprise Solutions, iON-Small and Medium Businesses,  IT Infrastructure Services, Mobility Products and Services and Platform Solutions.

The Company’s registered ofﬁce is in Mumbai and it has 64 subsidiaries across the globe.
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of preparation   These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in  India under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain ﬁnancial instruments which are measured  at fair value.
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared to comply in all material aspects with the accounting  standards notiﬁed under Section 211(3C) (which continues to be applicable in terms of General circular 15/2013 dated  September 13, 2013 of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in respect of Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013) and other  relevant provisions of the Companies Act,1956.
Comparative ﬁgures do not include the ﬁgures of erstwhile TCS e-Serve Limited and the discontinued operations of  e-Serve International Limited which is amalgamated with the Company effective April 1, 2013.
Consequently, the  comparative ﬁgures are not comparable with the ﬁgures for the year ended March 31, 2014. b) Use of estimates   The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires the management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating to the contingent liabilities as at the date  of the ﬁnancial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the year.
Examples of such estimates  include provisions for doubtful receivables, employee beneﬁts, provision for income taxes, accounting for contract costs  expected to be incurred, the useful lives of depreciable ﬁxed assets and provisions for impairment.
Future results could  differ due to changes in these estimates and the difference between the actual results and the estimates are recognised in  the period in which the results are known/materialise.
c) Fixed Assets   Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation / amortisation.
Costs include all expenses incurred to bring t he asset to its present location and condition.
Fixed assets exclude computers and other assets individually costing ` 50,000 or less which are not capitalised except when  they are part of a larger capital investment programme.
d) Depreciation / Amortisation   Depreciation / amortisation on ﬁxed assets, other than freehold land and capital work-in-progress is charged so as to  write-off the cost of assets, on the following basis: Type of asset Method Rate / Period Leasehold land and buildings Straight line Lease period Freehold buildings Written down value 5.00% Factory buildings Straight line 10.00% Leasehold improvements Straight line Lease period Plant and machinery Straight line 33.33% Computer equipment Straight line 25.00% Vehicles Written down value 25.89% Ofﬁce equipment Written down value 13.91% Electrical installations Written down value 13.91% Furniture and ﬁxtures Straight line 100% Intellectual property / distribution rights Straight line 24 – 60 months Rights under licensing agreement Straight line License period   Fixed assets purchased for speciﬁc projects are depreciated over the period of the project.
Annual Report 2013-14 Unconsolidated Financial Statements150 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements e) Leases   Assets taken on lease by the Company in its capacity as lessee, where the Company has substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance lease.
Such a lease is capitalised at the inception of the lease at lower of the  fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments and a liability is recognised for an equivalent amount.
Each  lease rental paid is allocated between the liability and the interest cost so as to obtain a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability for each year.
Lease arrangements where the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset substantially vest with the lessor, are  recognised as operating leases.
Lease rentals under operating leases are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss on  a straight-line basis.
f) Impairment   At each balance sheet date, the management reviews the carrying amounts of its assets included in each cash generating  unit to determine whether there is any indication that those assets were impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.
Recoverable amount is the  higher of an asset’s net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows expected  from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount  rate that reﬂects the current market assessments of time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Reversal of impairment loss is recognised as income in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
g) Investments   Long-term investments and current maturities of long-term investments are stated at cost, less provision for other than  temporary diminution in value.
Current investments, except for current maturities of long-term investments, comprising  investments in mutual funds are stated at the lower of cost and fair value.
h) Employee beneﬁts (i) Post-employment beneﬁt plans    Contributions to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have  rendered services entitling them to such beneﬁts.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full  in the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period in which they occur.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to  the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, or amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the  beneﬁts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt  obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any  asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future  contributions to the scheme.
(ii) Other employee beneﬁts    The undiscounted amount of short-term employee beneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered  by employees is recognised during the period when the employee renders the service.
These beneﬁts include  compensated absences such as paid annual leave, overseas social security contributions and performance incentives.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which  the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of  the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date.
i) Revenue recognition   Revenues from contracts priced on a time and material basis are recognised when services are rendered and related costs  are incurred.
Revenues from turnkey contracts, which are generally time bound ﬁxed price contracts, are recognised over the life of  the contract using the proportionate completion method, with contract costs determining the degree of completion.
Foreseeable losses on such contracts are recognised when probable.
Revenues from the sale of equipment are recognised upon delivery, which is when title passes to the customer.
Revenues from sale of software licences are recognised upon delivery.
Revenues from maintenance contracts are recognised pro-rata over the period of the contract.
In respect of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services, revenue on time and material and unit priced contracts  is recognised as the related services are rendered, whereas revenue from ﬁxed price contracts is recognised as per the  proportionate completion method with contract cost determining the degree of completion.
Revenues are reported net of discounts.
Dividends are recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised on time proportion  basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
Unconsolidated Financial Statements 151 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements j) Taxation   Current income tax expense comprises taxes on income from operations in India and in foreign jurisdictions.
Income tax  payable in India is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Tax expense relating to  foreign operations is determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are domiciled.
Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which gives rise to future economic beneﬁts  in the form of adjustment of future income tax liability, is considered as an asset if there is convincing evidence that the  Company will pay normal income tax after the tax holiday period.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as an asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt associated with it will  fructify.
Deferred tax expense or beneﬁt is recognised on timing differences being the difference between taxable income and  accounting income that originate in one period and is likely to reverse in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax  assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the  balance sheet date.
In the event of unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent  that there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available  to realise such assets.
In other situations, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there is reasonable  certainty that sufﬁcient future taxable income will be available to realise these assets.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance taxes  paid and income tax provisions arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the Company is  able to and intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
The Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if it has a legally enforceable right and these relate t o  taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
k) Foreign currency transactions   Income and expenses in foreign currencies are converted at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency monetary assets and liabilities other than net investments in non-integral foreign operations are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt  and loss.
Exchange difference arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of an enterprise’s net investments  in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward, options and futures contracts are amortised and recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss over the period of the contract.
Foreign exchange forward, options and future contracts  outstanding at the balance sheet date, other than designated cash ﬂow hedges, are stated at fair values and any gains or  losses are recognised in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
l) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting   The Company uses foreign exchange forward, options and future contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign  currency ﬂuctuations relating to certain ﬁrm commitments and forecasted transactions.
The Company designates these  hedging instruments as cash ﬂow hedges.
The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Company’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide  written principles on the use of such ﬁnancial derivatives consistent with the Company’s risk management strategy.
Hedging instruments are initially measured at fair value, and are remeasured at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in  the fair value of these derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised directly in  shareholders’ funds and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
The Company  separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments, only the fair value change  in the intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair values of the time value of option, which was previously recognised  immediately in proﬁt or loss, is now accumulated in hedging reserve, a component of shareholders’ funds and is classiﬁed  to proﬁt or loss when the forecast transaction occurs.
This change in accounting for time value of an option has resulted in  a reduction in proﬁt before tax of ` 4.76 crores for the year ended March 31, 2014.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of proﬁt and loss as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer  qualiﬁes for hedge accounting.
Cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in shareholders’ funds  is retained there and is classiﬁed to Statement of proﬁt and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged  transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ funds is transferred  to the statement of proﬁt and loss for the period.
Annual Report 2013-14 Unconsolidated Financial Statements152 Notes forming part of the Financial Statements m) Inventories   Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined  on a weighted average basis.
Purchased goods-in-transit are carried at cost.
Work-in-progress is carried at the lower of  cost and net realisable value.
Stores and spare parts are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finished goods  produced or purchased by the Company are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct material  and labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overheads.
n) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets   A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past event and it is probable that an  outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which reliable estimate can be made.
Provisions  (excluding retirement beneﬁts) are not discounted to its present value and are determined based on best estimate required  to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reﬂect the  current best estimates.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
