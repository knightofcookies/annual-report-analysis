2 CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE Withdrawal of US from the nuclear deal with Iran and  subsequent re-imposition of sanctions on the latter  demonstrated the significant influence of geopolitics  on oil and gas markets.
Climate change concerns, the  remarkable growth of renewables and anticipated energy  transitions have added to the complexity of the industry  landscape.
It is important to note that, while energy mix projections  vary by the source agency, Oil and Natural Gas are  expected to remain one of the most important sources  of energy over the foreseeable future.
Keeping in view  the long term focus, your Company has continued  to maintain good investment level in its core area of  Exploration and Production (E&P) despite the high  volatility in the Crude prices.
I, on behalf of the Board of Directors as well as 32,265  dedicated energy soldiers of Oil & Natural Gas  Corporation Ltd (ONGC), present to you the Company’s  Annual Report for the financial year 2017-18.
FY’18 was another year of continued success story for  your Company’s businesses.
We made as many as 12  hydrocarbon discoveries out of which two discoveries  one each in Cambay and Cauvery Onshore, have  already been put on production.
Reserve accretion (2P)  for the year stood at 67.83 MMtoe.
With a Reserve  Replacement Ratio (RRR) of 1.48, we expanded our  hydrocarbon resource base for the twelfth consecutive  year.
Our crude production volumes remained steady  with a marked improvement in gas output; capital  outlays remained robust; profit edged higher and  dividend payout was impressive.
Beyond E&P ,  acquisition of HPCL added further strength to our  already respectable downstream portfolio.
E&P , the mainstay of our energy business, will continue  to be the principal focus area of the management strategy  and investments in the years to come.
It is widely recognized that the era of ‘easy oil’ is over.
Hydrocarbon exploration is getting tougher with  associated costs expected to face upward pressures.
Extended period of low oil prices has necessitated the  adoption of a more cost-effective and operationally- efficient approach.
We have done well in this regard.
At  just over USD6 per barrel of oil equivalent, our finding  costs are among the most competitive globally.
We are  continuously working towards optimising the same  further.
We are focussing on greater integration of the  ‘right technology’ into our campaign and more focused  Dear Members,  Y our participation in our business is one of the  fundamental drivers of ONGC’s sustained growth and  its contribution to the energy landscape of the country.
Protecting shareholder interests through sustained value  creation is top priority for the Company.
I thank you  heartily for your continued support.
Though the year 2017-18 (FY’18) witnessed a lot of  uncertainties, the market movement during the year  was in contrast to the previous year.
Global crude prices  recorded a strong recovery and more than doubled from  early-2016 levels.
This is a positive indicator for the health  and growth outlook of the Oil & Gas sector.
3 exploratory inputs through better seismic API.
As you are  aware, your Company is also associated as an integral part  of National Seismic Programme.
Production performance remained on track and our  contribution to domestic hydrocarbon supplies increased  year-on-year, largely on the back of higher gas output.
Standalone crude oil production recorded increase to  22.31 MMT in FY’18 as compared to 22.25 MMT in  FY’17.
Natural gas production registered an impressive  growth of over 6% as production for FY’18 rose to  23.48 BCM as compared to 22.09 BCM in FY’17.
Our  cumulative domestic hydrocarbon volumes (inclusive of  our share in JV-operated properties), also recorded an  increase; 50.05 MMtoe vis-a-vis 48.81 MMtoe in FY’17.
Production of Value Added Products increased for the  fourth consecutive year – VAP output in FY’18 stood at  3.39 MMT , with an increase of 4.6% over FY’17 volumes.
The fact that we have continued to achieve production  growth with a largely mature portfolio makes the feat  even more rewarding.
Despite the maturity of our key  fields, our IOR/EOR schemes are aimed at maximizing  hydrocarbon recovery from these ageing brownfields.
In FY’18, incremental oil gain from these projects  totalled 7.5 MMT , almost one-third of our total oil  output for the year.
A legacy-dependent portfolio, however, does present its  own set of challenges especially in a cash-constrained  operating environment.
However, with more projects  coming online in the next few years, we are confident of  reducing our reliance on ageing fields.
We expect a steady  step-up in our domestic hydrocarbon output, primarily  led by ramp-up in gas output from key projects such as  KG-DWN-98/2, Daman and Vashishta fields.
While  crude oil volumes will not experience the same level of  growth as gas, Western Offshore redevelopment projects  will add incremental oil to our portfolio, helping offset the  natural decline of our base portfolio.
Seventeen projects  completed during the last 4 years contributed over 6  MMtoe of oil and gas supplies.
Y our Company completed  two major projects namely, Development of Western  Periphery and Integrated Development of Vashishta and  S1 Fields in FY’18 envisaging lifecycle oil and gas gains of  over 17 MMtoe.
Drilling is central to any E&P activity.
FY’18 proved to  be another record-setting year for our drilling operations.
For the second consecutive year, as many as 503 wells  were drilled - the highest ever.
Y our Company drilled  119 exploratory wells - the highest number in the last 6  years and   also achieved the highest cycle and commercial  speed.
With 37 rigs operating in the offshore, the  Company remains focused on expanding its presence and  expertise in a terrain that has historically been its strong  suite.
Deepwater drilling is an exciting new arena within  this domain and the Company plans to drill 24 deep  water wells in FY’19.
A majority of our future oil and gas  supplies are offshore-based which makes offshore drilling  critical to the Company’s success in the medium term.
Considering the capital-intensive offshore operations,  cost optimisation is key to mitigating the inherent risks of  any offshore upstream project.
ONGC’s Offshore drilling  costs have come down by 7% in FY’18 which in absolute  terms is significant.
The Company is constantly striving  to further bring down the drilling costs.
Y our Company’s upstream capital program is growing  steadily unlike that of most oil and gas operators over  the past 4 years - a period that witnessed widespread  and extensive budget reductions in reaction to low  crude prices.
The committed capex of `320,770  Million for FY’19 is directed towards E&P activity.
While strong domestic oil demand and the country’s  high degree of reliance on imports are drivers for  sustaining robust investments in domestic upstream  activity, it is also a derivative of our positive outlook  on the domestic hydrocarbon potential.
The recently  concluded Hydrocarbon resource reassessment project  only confirms the view - prognosticated hydrocarbon  resource base of the country today stands at 42 Billion  tonnes of oil equivalent, up by 50% from past estimates.
The Company has also put in place firm plans to deliver  on its targets to support the 10% Import Reduction  mission, as envisioned by the Hon’ble Prime Minister.
Further, constant efforts are  being made to improve  the operational efficiencies through various “Research  and Development” activities carried out by the in- house institutes.
Coming to financials, the Company recorded Revenue  from Operations of `850,041 Million in FY’18 compared  to `779,078 Million in FY’17.
Profit After T ax increased  by over 11% to `199,453 Million in FY’18 against  `179,000 Million in FY’17.
The Company realized USD  57.33/bbl for crude sold in the domestic market in FY’18  as compared to USD 50.27/bbl in FY’17.
Dividends to shareholder for FY’18 remained healthy with  a total payout of `84,699 Million with impressive payout  ratio (including dividend distribution tax) of 51.13%.
We have consistently maintained a dividend payout ratio  4 of over 50% over the last 4 years.
Even as your Company  expands and diversifies its business, the Company is  steadfast in its commitment to maintain its consistent track  record in dividend payout to shareholders.
It is another  testament of business fundamentals and prudent approach  to capital management.
FY’18 proved to be good for our overseas arm, ONGC  Videsh Ltd also.
Following the acquisition of significant  stake in Russia’s Vankorneft in 2016, ONGC Videsh led  Indian consortium also acquired an important 10% stake  in the UAE’s offshore oil and gas field Zakum in February  2018.
Buoyed by incremental volumes from both these  assets, overseas hydrocarbon output rose by over 10% to  14.16 MMtoe in FY’18 versus 12.80 MMtoe in FY’17.
Consolidated Revenue from Operations and Consolidated  PAT during FY’18 stood at `104,176 Million and `9,815  Million as against `100,800 Million and  `7,573 Million  in FY’17, respectively.
Going forward, ONGC Videsh’s  international ventures are going to play a critical role in the  realization of ONGC’s long-term growth blueprint as well  as furthering sovereign energy diplomacy reach globally.
In the downstream business, MRPL registered highest  ever throughput at 16.31 MMT in FY’18.
The refining  unit recorded an impressive GRM of USD 7.54/bbl.
Revenue from Operations grew by 6.1% to `630,836  Million.
PAT stood at `22,241 Million.
The refining unit  also posted an 18% year-on-year growth in its exports.
It continues to maintain major share of the direct sales  segment of petroleum products market in Karnataka  and adjoining states and enhanced its market share for  Polypropylene with introduction of new and niche grades.
Providing another boost to the sustainability efforts of  ONGC group companies, the refinery also successfully  commissioned largest solar power project (6 MW) at a  refinery site in the country.
The acquisition of majority stake in state refining entity,  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), was a  defining move, one that significantly transforms ONGC’s  downstream portfolio.
While ONGC in itself remains  committed to excellence in upstream business, HPCL  fits well into the group’s integrated energy strategy.
HPCL will provide the Company, a pure-play refining  and marketing edge with an extensive retail presence  (over 15000 outlets) in the country, entailing significant  diversification benefits.
T ogether with MRPL, the  refining capacity of ONGC group today stands at over 40  MMT , making us the third largest in the country in terms  of installed capacity.
The Company is also substantially invested in the  Petrochemical segment.
ONGC Petro additions Ltd  (OPaL), a 1.1 MMTPA Ethylene Cracker unit, is one of  the largest dual-feed crackers in the world today.
Capacity  utilization of the plant is expected to be over 80% during  the current fiscal i.e.
FY’19, further reaching 100%  utilization toward the end of December 2019.
OPaL, in a  short span of time, has established itself in the domestic as  well as international markets, both with respect to quality  as well as price.
ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals  Limited (OMPL), another Petrochemical unit of ONGC  having production capacity of 1.2 MMTPA of Aromatics,  registered Revenue from Operations of `55,613 Million.
Close to 80% of its products, namely Paraxylene and  Benzene, are exported.
ONGC T ripura Power Company (OTPC), our Power  JV in the country’s North-eastern State of T ripura which  operates a 726 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Power  Plant, recorded Revenue from Operations of `12,516  Million and Profit After T ax of `1,251 Million in FY’18.
This is another noteworthy sustainability venture of ONGC  group, and a greenest UNFCCC- certified power plant of  the country.
This plant meets 35% power requirement of  North Eastern States.
As I mentioned already, the entire energy framework  is on the cusp of substantial restructuring – in fact, the  transformation is already underway.
With increasing  freedom for the consumer to choose from a wide array  of energy sources, the energy commodities market will  become more consumer-driven.
T echnology disruptions,  Renewables, Digitalization and Sustainability will be at  the core of this change.
Y our Company is gearing up for this period of  transformation.
An approach premised on sound  application of technology and sustainability is what  ONGC is embracing for discovering new pathways  of growth.
Application of cutting-edge technologies  in the way we locate and source our hydrocarbons to  implementation of paperless office and reduction of gas  flaring are all part of the Company’s resilient philosophy  of doing the business of energy.
Our globally-recognized  CDM projects and expanding engagement in renewables  also bear proof of our sustainable business ethics.
5 Y our Company has been continuously rated ‘outstanding’  grade CPSE as per DPE guideline on corporate  governance.
Beyond business, our CSR initiatives have also helped  the organization in making a positive impact in people’s  lives.
At the same time, it also sensitizes us to our role as  an important stakeholder of the society and environment.
In FY’18, your Company spent `5,034 Million for its  various CSR programs with target areas spanning from  Healthcare, Sanitation, Education to Environment and  Sustainability.
In line with the Government policy, your Company has  set up a Start Up fund of `1,000 Million dedicated to  foster, nurture and incubate new ideas related to energy.
As a part of this initiative, we signed MOUs with 5 Start- Ups in FY’18.
I am happy to inform that ONGC officers  after scaling Mount Everest last year, also successfully  summited the third highest and most challenging peak,  Mount Kanchenjunga in FY’18.
Though our main objective is energy security, I firmly  believe that ONGC has, over the years, proven its  capability to contribute effectively to larger national  goals and priorities.
Here, I would like to thank the  Government of India, especially our administrative  Ministry - the  Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas,  for its constant support and encouragement.
A lot of what  we have achieved as the country’s flagship energy explorer  would have been difficult without the policy support and  facilitating approach of the Government.
Notwithstanding the shifts and turns in the market,  your consistent belief in our growth story and enduring  association with us is what keeps us motivated to emerge  stronger and more competitive with every passing year.
At the successful closure of yet another financial year, I  express my gratitude for this much valued invaluable  investment and support.
Look forward to continuing this  journey and achieving greater heights together.
Sd/- (Shashi Shanker)  Chairman and Managing Director 6 Board’s Report Dear Members, It gives me immense pleasure to present, on behalf of the  Board of Directors of your Company, the 25 th Annual  Report on the business and operations of Oil And Natural  Gas Corporation Ltd.

Global Economy After a protracted period of underwhelming growth that  failed to deliver uniformly across the global map and  often times lagged forecast numbers as a host of issues,  global GDP growth (in real terms) posted its best ever  performance in the last 7 years.
As per the April 2018  World Economic Outlook (WEO) of International  Monetary Fund (IMF), global GDP growth in 2017  picked up from where it left in the latter half of 2016  reflected in the 3.8% uptick in world output.
Performance  in the second half of the year was particularly impressive  coming in at above 4%, the strongest since the second half  of 2010, supported by a recovery in investment.
This robust and, more importantly, evenly spread recovery  was primarily driven by resurgence in global trade and  investment.
International trade recovered strongly in  2017 after two years of weakness, to an estimated real  growth rate of 4.9%.
Stock markets, across the map, made  major gains in 2017: the MSCI all-country world index  gained 22% or USD 9tn on the year to an all-time high of  514.53.
Another reliable indicator of the health of international  markets is the duo of global energy demand and  commodity prices.
Crude oil prices which had plumbed  to below USD 30 a barrel in the early part of 2016 closed  the year at above USD 65 a barrel.
As per the IHS-Markit,  global crude oil demand grew by 1.9 million bpd in 2017,  matching the pace set in 2015 which was more in response  to the steep drop in crude prices.
The natural gas price  index rose sharply, by 45% from August 2017 to February  2018.
Metal prices had also increased 8.3% from August  2017 to February 2018.
Advanced economies grew by 2.3% in 2017, against  1.7% growth recorded in 2016.
Strong growth has also  helped in the reduction of unemployment levels in many  advanced economies.
The group of emerging and developing economies grew  at a rate of 4.8% in 2017 versus the 4.4% growth recorded  in 2016.
GDP in China grew at 6.9% in 2017 compared  at 6.7% in 2016, well above the emerging market and  developing economy average.
“Snapshot of Indian Economy: The Indian economy  has slowed in recent times and GDP growth in 2017, as  per IMF WEO (April 2018), slipped to 6.7% compared to  7.1% in 2016.
This is the second consecutive year of lower  growth after having outpaced China in 2015 as the world’s  fastest growing major economy.
However, this slowdown  is less structural in nature and more in response to the  market adjustment necessitated by the currency exchange  initiative and the nationwide rollout of the uniform  taxation framework, Goods and Services T ax.
And the process of recovery is already underway – as per  data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), GDP  grew by 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of FY’18, with  the overall growth for the year at 6.7%.
As per IMF WEO,  the country is projected to register GDP growth rates of  7.4% and 7.8% in 2018 and 2019 respectively.
CRISIL  Research projects a GDP growth of 7.5% for FY’19.
That being said, the policymakers must keep a keen eye  on the rising crude prices and the serious issue of bad- debt laden banking sector.
While the Government has  taken steps towards alleviating the banking sector crisis  through a recapitalization plan, there is scarce little that  the Government can do when it comes to crude prices.
The uptick in international crude prices through 2017  (and the first half of 2018) then has effectively removed  this latent buoy that the economy had at its disposal until  FY’17.
Current account deficit in FY’18 is projected at  1.9% versus 0.7% in FY’17.
” At the global level, the economy is expected to edge higher  on the growth trajectory with a 3.9% uptick in GDP in  2018 as well as 2019 as per the IMF WEO.
Momentum is  sustained on the back of continued growth in the emerging  market and developing economies and positive knock-on  effects in world markets from the accommodative fiscal  conditions in developed economies, particularly in the  US.
Among the emerging economies, growth in India is  expected to offset the slowdown in the Chinese economy  to an extent and recovery in commodity prices should  buoy investments and improvement in the fiscal situation  for exporters in this group.
Despite two reasonably strong years of growth in 2016  and 2017 and a forecast for an encore through 2018 and  84 2019, the global outlook for growth beyond 2019 in the  medium term, however, remains cautiously conservative  with definite emergence of more downside risks, as per  most global economic reports and analysis.
One of the  biggest risks to the global economy is the heightening of  a ‘protectionist approach’ evidenced in the recent US- China trade war.
UK’s withdrawal from EU – tagged the  ‘Brexit’ in global circles – is another.
Further, heightening  of tensions in the Middle-East due to re-imposition of  sanctions by US on Iran, diplomatic standoff between  Qatar and other Gulf countries, sanctions on Russia and  regional implications of China’s Belt Road Initiative add to  the risk-quotient of the world economy.
Climate-related  risks also rank high in terms of impact due to its disruptive  potential, so does the risk posed to the stability of the  connected global economy by the increasing number of  instances of cyberattacks.

Global Energy Snapshot Global Energy  Basket: As per BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2018, Energy  demand grew by an impressive 2.2% in 2017, the strongest  since 2013 and well above the 1.7% of the past decade.
Renewables was the fastest growing energy source  (+17%) having recorded the largest ever increase to their  base with addition of 69 Mmtoe.
Nevertheless, all low- carbon sources together met just a third of the 253Mtoe  (2.2%) increase in global energy demand in 2017.
Fossil  fuels met the remaining two thirds, with gas (+83Mtoe,  3.0%) the single-largest source of new energy supply  last year.
Oil consumption growth averaged 1.8%, or 1.7  million bpd, above its 10-year average of 1.2% for the third  consecutive year.
Interestingly, coal consumption grew for  the first time since 2013.
That being said, the fuel’s share  in the energy mix continues to drop and is at its lowest  since 2004 at 27.6%.
The rise in demand for coal, oil and gas means global  CO2 emissions grew by 426 MtCO2 (1.6%) in 2017.
This follows three years of flat or falling emissions, when  coal use was also falling.
Oil and Gas Demand-Supply: As per BP Statistical Review of World Energy, oil demand  growth in 2017 (+1.7 million bpd) easily bested the 10 year  average (~1.1 million bpd).
China (500,000 bpd) and the  US (190,000 bpd) were the single largest contributors to  growth.
That this has come despite all the talk centered on  demand peaking, increase in car efficiency and higher levels  of excitement around the Electric Vehicles (EV) market  highlights oil’s salience in the energy ecosystem.
Demand is  projected to remain robust strong through 2018 and 2019  as well.
Oil demand grew by 130,000 bpd in India.
On the supply side, output growth in 2017 (+600,000  bpd) was similar to that in 2016.
While OPEC and select  non-OPEC countries (together known as the ‘Vienna  group’) led supplies in 2016, it was the other non-OPEC  countries, primarily US, that contributed to the volume  uptick in 2017.
As per IHS-Markit, US crude oil output  grew by close to 500,000 bpd in 2017.
According to BP  Statistical Review, the impact of the production cuts by  the Vienna group would have been even bigger had it not  been for the response of US tight oil and NGLs, which  have grown by almost 2 million bpd since October 2016.
US is projected to intensify its volume growth further  through 2018 and 2019, adding close to 2.4 million bpd  during the period, as per EIA estimates.
The earlier than scheduled discontinuance of the  production cut arrangement among member of the  ‘Vienna group’ adds a further variable to the demand- supply dynamic going forward.
However, the projected  re-introduction of the off-market barrels is unlikely  to bring down prices significantly in view of the ever- worsening Venezuelan production, the continuing  uncertainty around Iranian and Libyan volumes and the  sudden shutdown of a major oil sands facility in Canada.
Brent crude averaged above USD 75/bbl in the two weeks  following the decision to terminate the agreement before  the earlier deadline of end of 2018.
Natural gas posted a record-breaking 2017, in terms of  both production as well as consumption, with highest- ever gains since the global financial meltdown.
The 96  bcm increase in consumption was mostly driven by China  (31 bcm) with support from Middle East (Iran – 13 bcm)  and Europe.
The growth in consumption was more than  matched by increasing production, particularly in Russia  (46 bcm), supported by Iran (21 bcm), Australia (17 bcm)  and China (11 bcm).
The rampant gas demand witnessed  in the Chinese market can be ascribed to the looming  deadline for the five-year Environment Action Plan  announced in 2013 for effecting air-quality improvements.
The continued growth of global LNG trade also supported  the expansion of international gas market.
Global Crude Prices: If 2016 marked a year when anything looked possible  in terms of prices heading south with a barrel of crude  fetching for under USD 30 in early part of the year, 2017  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 85 presented a more sanguine picture for oil price recovery  and, with it, for all near-term and future investment  plans in the hydrocarbon arena, especially the upstream  segment as prices held sustainably around the USD 55/ bbl mark and kept edging higher as the year progressed.
While the initial momentum for this recovery was  provided by the production cutback agreement, courtesy  OPEC and a select non-OPEC producers group,  impressive global oil demand growth in 2017 further  intensified the consolidation of crude prices consistently  above USD 50/bbl levels during the year.
The surge in crude prices have kicked into an even higher  gear in 2018 as geopolitical stress also started to weigh on  a market that is tangibly tighter than it was two years back.
Average Brent Crude prices for the month of May 2018 was  USD 76/bbl while WTI averaged around USD 70/bbl.
OPEC and non-OPEC production cut: The rally in crude prices had kicked off in late 2016 with  the announcement of the production cut arrangement  between OPEC and a group of other non-OPEC  producers.
The agreement, which came into effect in  January 2017, promised to remove 1.8 million bpd of  crude from international markets.
Abandoning the earlier  plan to have the arrangement in place until the end of  2018, the group, in their June 22 meeting in Vienna, instead  decided to boost production supplies to put a cap on crude  oil prices in view of oil’s rally in the first half of 2018.
Notwithstanding the initial scepticism surrounding the  move’s efficacy in shoring up global crude prices, the group  more than delivered on its target of removing 1.8 million  bpd off markets.
In May 2018, the group had exceeded their  pledged cutback target by close to 50%.
The new deal is  designed to effectively roll back the deeper-than-intended  cuts from nations such as Venezuela, returning the curbs to  the level originally agreed in 2016 through higher output from  countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia which possess ample  spare capacity.
While the arrangement is to bring online close  to a million bpd to adjust global markets, analysts reckon the  eventual addition is likely to be close to 600,000 bpd, about  0.5% of global supply, as several members such as Venezuela  and Libya are incapable of voluntarily raising output.
Exploration As per initial estimates of Wood Mackenzie, conventional  discoveries at 11.2 billion boe are at their lowest in a  decade – but a success rate of 36% makes it the best  year since 2013 in terms of targeted and more effective  exploratory endeavours.
Oil accounted for 56% of  discovered volumes, a share last seen in 2008, with eight  out of the top ten discoveries being oil weighted.
While discovery costs edged up slightly relative to 2016,  the increase in average size of discovery and the return of  wildcats in ultra-deepwater and frontier basins are the big  positives.
If exploration projects in 2016 largely focused  on near-field possibilities while more or less eschewing  frontier areas, wildcat successes of 2017 indicate a more  balanced approach is, perhaps, the more sustainable  approach for operators in the long-term as they try to  manage both volume growth (or resource replacement)  and cost-efficiency.
Exploratory drilling in frontier areas  accounted for just 10% of the total wells drilled but  returned 33% of the total discovered volumes.
As per Wood Mackenzie, five giant (>500 mmboe)  and 14 large (>100 mmboe) discoveries were made in  2017 with the 2.6 bnboe Yakaar gas discovery, made by  Kosmos-BP , in the ultra-deepwater of Senegal being the  largest discovery of 2017.
While the US unconventional space has garnered the  most eyeballs in the current decade, the significance of  conventional exploration, and within it that of deepwater  discoveries, in meeting the rising global oil demand  cannot be discounted.
As per GlobalData, deep and ultra- deepwater resources accounted for almost half of the  total recoverable discovered volumes from 2001 to 2016.
What has further emboldened operators’ more optimistic  stance on deepwater operations is the reduced offshore  rig rates and the rise in global crude prices.
Big-ticket  discoveries in Senegal and Guyana and significant interest  in Mexican deepwater and Brazilian pre-salt auctions  indicate the changing outlook for offshore/deepwater  upstream business.
Upstream Investments and Project FIDs Oil and gas companies committed more capital to  operations in 2017, relative to 2016.
Furthermore, with  sustained oil prices at levels of over USD 60 a barrel in  the latter half of 2017 and no forecasts of prices trending  lower in the near future, capital spends are likely to  further rise in 2018 by over 10%, as per Wood Mackenzie.
The US unconventional sector is even more bullish with  companies’ budgets up 18% year-on-year.
Upstream E&D  capex was USD 222 bn in 2017 and is projected to be over  USD 245 bn in 2018.
The expanded appetite for more upstream activity is  reflected in the higher number of Project Final Investment  86 Decisions (FIDs) made in 2017.
2017 saw a total of 32  projects, with cumulative reserves of over 12 billion boe,  being approved for implementation, a noticeable jump  from compared to 14 in 2016 and merely 9 in 2015.
With  15 projects already achieving FID by May 2018, the pace  of project approvals is set to continue in 2018 as well.
The number of projects passing the ‘fitness’ test is  certainly a positive for industry sentiment – but projects  of today are distinctly different from that of a few years  ago in more ways than one.
Service sector cost reductions,  internal capital discipline and operational efficiencies  have brought down average breakeven of projects by over  20% in 2017 and is projected to go down by a further 15%  in 2018.
Projects are also getting smaller – average spend and  reserves per project in 2017 was USD 2.7 bn and 376  mn bbls respectively, both being the lowest in a decade.
Compare this with the USD 5.5 bn spend per project  for the last decade.
So, while part of project cost de- escalation is attributable to cost deflation, companies  have also consciously adopted a leaner execution strategy  with faster return to cashflow generation.
Companies are  also leaning more toward brownfield implementation  schemes as ability to tie in with existing infrastructure  reduces upfront capital expenses for infrastructure  creation.
That being said, Greenfield deepwater projects  with world-class reservoirs and substantial volumes  (e.g.
Liza in Guyana or Libra in Brazil) still make sound  economic sense.
Breakevens in some of these are at par  with US tight oil.
While 2017 represented a positive year in terms of project  approvals, sanctioned capacity of 1.4 - 1.5 million bpd  is still a far way off from the 2.7 million bpd capacity  sanctioned in 2013, prior to the crash, as per IHS-Markit.
Costs The crude oil price crash caused considerable damage  to the businesses of oilfield service companies.
The  subsequent deflation of service sector costs was a  manifestation of that impact as steep discounts and  contract renegotiations became the order of the day.
According to IHS Markit estimates, the full-cycle  breakeven cost to develop new oil projects globally has  declined nearly 25%, from a global average of USD 57/bbl  in 2014 to USD 42/bbl in 2017.
Cost savings associated  with the development of a new oil field range from less  than 10% to as much as 50% depending on the play.
Most  major global oil plays now break even below USD 60/bbl,  compared to USD 90/bbl prior to the oil price downturn  in 2014.
Even US shale market, which was expected  to bear the brunt of the price plunge, has witnessed its  breakevens come down from USD 75/bbl in 2014 to  USD 44/bbl in 2017.
Deepwater has achieved the greatest fall in unit costs  through the downturn on the back of lower rig rates and  subsea costs.
Average leading-edge rig rates are about  65% below their 2014 peak.
Breakeven prices for offshore  fields in shallow water declined from an average of USD  44/bbl in 2014 to USD 25/bbl in 2018, while full-cycle  breakevens for deepwater projects fell from an average of  USD 60/bbl in 2014 to USD 34/bbl in 2018.
But with oil prices on the rise once again and with it  the service sector requirements, the big question that  companies must answer in the next couple of years is  how much of the realized cost savings of the past 4 years  can be sustained even in a higher price environment.
As  per Wood Mackenzie, outside of the US unconventional  space, most cyclical capital and operating cost reductions  can be sustained until the end of the decade, but probably  not much further.
Even in the US tight oil market, as  cost savings are eroded by increasing service sector  rates, productivity and efficiency gains is likely to offset  a large part of that cost inflation.
Offshore remains in a  sweet spot in the medium term – as per IEA’s Offshore  Energy Outlook, average capital costs for offshore oil and  gas projects by 2025 are still likely to be 25% below 2014  levels due to an oversupply of offshore rigs.
Global Gas and LNG An element of uncertainty has crept into the narrative  of Gas’ role as the ‘bridge fuel’ in the evolving energy  matrix despite it being the cleanest burning and fastest  growing among the fossil fuels.
This is a result of a  wide array of factors: depleting production in European  mainland that sets it up for high imports and thereby  increasing dependency on Russia; insufficient domestic  resource base in demand centres of Asia and growing  competiveness of renewable energy sources.
That being  said, the future of gas appears more secure in North  America because of its huge resource, technological  advances, a market-driven economy and robust demand.
What further complicates the outlook of gas in Europe is the  continent’s aggressive implementation of climate-change  policies which further works to restrict its expansion over  the longer term even as countries are already phasing  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 87 out coal and nuclear.
Pipeline transportation of gas too  is fraught with significant execution risks on account  of diverse political and geopolitical interests.
A case  in point is Gazprom’s 55 bcm capacity Nordstream 2  pipeline which has already generated a lot of controversy  within the EU as countries strive to strike a fine balance  between domestic energy security and reducing Europe’s  dependence on Russian gas.
In view of its energy appetite,  Asia remains the focus of most gas exporting countries.
While China is set to overtake Japan as the world’s largest  natural gas importer and India setting aggressive targets  of upping gas consumption reflected in its pickup in LNG  imports in the past few years, Southeast Asia with the  likes of Indonesia and Malaysia is also emerging as a hub  for long-term LNG demand growth.
Abundance of cheap  coal, pace of infrastructure buildup and import prices are  the potential hurdles on its growth path.
Global LNG trade sustained its momentum in 2017 with  volumes growing by 11% y-o-y to 297 MMT , as per IHS- Markit data.
Bulk of the demand was driven by Asian  consumers with China accounting for over 40% of the  incremental volumes.
Asian imports totalled over 70% of  the 2017 trade volume.
However, the LNG industry must quickly find a way out  of its current impasse on project FIDs – just a total of 3  projects were given the go-ahead in the past two years.
Lack  of projects does not only dim the possibility of oversupply  it also sharply increases the chances of a tighter market in  the next few years leading to spikes in prices.
With LNG  prices already on the rise with the recovery in crude oil  prices, a protracted period of inactivity will deflate future  LNG demand.
Asian LNG prices in winter 2017/18 spiked  to over USD 11/MMBtu, more than double summer levels  and the highest prices for three years.
M&A Global M&A activity rebounded for the second straight  year on the back of stronger crude oil prices, as per IHS- Markit reporting.
Dealmaking was particularly strong in  the early part of the year as prices ticked over the USD 50  mark; however, the pace waned in the following quarters  as volatility returned to the markets and expectations of  buyers and sellers started to diverge on the fair value of   a transaction.
As per IHS-Markit, T otal transaction value for the full  year increased modestly, reaching nearly USD 160 billion.
Asset deal value rose strongly for the second straight year  coming in at USD 112 billion, the highest in three years,  while corporate deal count at 25 was the lowest in 15  years with only 1 deal valued in excess of USD 10 billion.
The predominance of asset deals reflects the uncertainty  surrounding the current oil price recovery as companies  prefer to go in for strategic value-plus acquisitions instead  of a portfolio that could yield mixed results.
Renewables Renewables clocked another strong year of growth in  2017 – led by solar energy – on the back of drop in  costs and strong commitments to less-carbon intensive  path of energy growth in developing economies (China,  India, Brazil).
As per the UNEP Global Renewable  Energy T rends Report, a record 157 GW of renewable  power were commissioned in 2017, up from 143 GW in  2016 and far out-stripping the 70GW of net fossil fuel  generating capacity added last year.
Solar alone accounted  for 98 GW, which translated to 38% of the net new power  capacity that came online during the year.
Investments in renewable energy edged up 2% during 2017  to USD 279.8 bn, taking cumulative investments to USD  2.9 trillion since 2004.
Developing economies committed  USD 177 billion to renewables in 2017, up 20%, compared  to USD 103 billion for developed countries, down 19%.
That investments in the sector continue to rise in a  backdrop of falling costs of wind and solar and noticeable  recovery of crude oil prices (and with it the business  appetite in the hydrocarbon space) reaffirms that the  mainstreaming of renewables in the energy mix is here to  stay and its criticality to achieving future energy goals has  found acceptance across the world.
The potential for renewable energy sources are significant  in our country.
As per the Ministry of New and Renewable  Energy, India has a wind potential of more than 300 GW  at a hub height of 100 metre, solar potential of ~750  GW assuming 3% wasteland is made available and small  hydro potential of~20 GW.
As of March 2018, total  renewable power generation (including large hydro)  installed capacity in the country stood at 114.31 GW,  which is 33.23 per cent of the total installed capacity of  344 GW.
As part of the country’s COP 21 commitments,  the Government has formulated an action plan to achieve  a total capacity of 60 GW from hydro power and 175  GW from other RES (excluding large hydro projects) by  March, 2022, which includes 100 GW of Solar power, 60  GW from wind power, 10 GW from biomass power and 5  GW from small hydro power.
88 As the sector grows in size and scope, the industry  stakeholders must address a few key questions: ability of  the sector to be commercially viable sans any subsidies  or government support; the issue of intermittency and  battery costs.
Geopolitics With the gradual tightening of the market as global  liquids demand picked up and supplies eased on the  back of production cutbacks implemented by the OPEC- non OPEC combine, the bogey of geopolitics made its  reappearance in global oil market in 2017.
In fact, the  sustained pickup in crude from the final quarter of 2017  through most of early 2018 can be said to have a distinct  geopolitical undertone – a reaction to US’ changed stance  pertaining to the Iran nuclear deal and step-up of regional  tensions in the Middle-East, home to a third of current  global crude supplies.
The current state of heightened geopolitical tensions  stems largely from the US withdrawal from the Iran  Nuclear Deal of 2015 which facilitated Iran’s re-integration  with the global economy and further complications in the  Middle-East, a region that has, over the years, become  synonymous with unrest and turmoil.
Although industry  analysts reckon that current US-led sanctions are unlikely  to be as effective as the past one, exercised by US-EU  together, which brought down Iranian export volumes by  almost 1.5 million bpd, a more aggressive stance by US  this time around on how its allies respond to its calls of  cutting down on Iranian barrels makes the situation more  volatile.
The Middle-eastern picture is further compounded  by the ongoing diplomatic and trade standoff in the  region featuring Qatar and other members of the Gulf  Cooperation Council and the attempted Y emeni strikes  on Saudi oil installations.
Beyond this, lack of legitimacy  of governments in countries like Syria, Libya and Y emen  which has allowed the entry of destabilising non-state  actors into the picture has now become a source of  unceasing pain for the oil and gas sector.
A case in point is  Libya’s production trajectory.
Venezuela’s staggering drop  in production, where production has fallen by more than  500,000 bpd in the past one year and is projected to drop  by another 600,000 bpd by December 2019, is a more  near-term threat to the stability of global oil markets.
While the glut of supply from the US has buffered  the markets from the full impact of the deteriorating  conditions within the OPEC countries in recent times, in  the longer term with shale output unable to meet growing  demand the unresolved state of affairs in one of the globe’s  most hydrocarbon-rich regions can worryingly have an  even more telling impact on crude markets.
3.
India Energy Snapshot A strong energy demand trajectory typifies a robust  economy and India’s energy demand trend clearly affirms  that.
Over the past 10 years (terminal year 2016), India  energy demand has grown at a pace of 5.7% CAGR versus  a wold average of 1.7%.
Looking further ahead, demand is  expected to intensify as the economy picks up steam.
As  per the IEA World Energy Outlook 2017, India’s primary  energy consumption is set to rise from around 900 Mmtoe  in 2016 to 1900 MMtoe in 2040 (3.2% CAGR) under the  New Policies scenario.
While our energy basket remains primarily fossil fuel-based,  led by coal, demand growth for fossil fuels is projected to  be easily outstripped by that of renewables over the longer  term.
The pace of growth for renewables is estimated at  over 13% annually – compare that with the 3% demand  growth for both oil and coal.
Gas, however, is seen playing  a stronger role in the future domestic economy because of  its cleaner carbon profile and increasing integration into  the mainstream on the back of Government prioritization,  faster buildup of the necessary infrastructure and access  to cheaper and diverse supply sources.
The Government  has set a clear goal of increasing the share of gas from  around 6% currently to 15% by 2030.
Expansion of the gas  sector caters effectively to multiple national priorities – of  limiting carbon intensity of our economy, generating huge  employment opportunities, facilitating industrial activity  and rejuvenating domestic E&P activity.
Despite the surge in demand for renewables over the  longer term, evolution of the fuel mix still remains a  gradual affair, with fossil fuels continuing to account for  more than 85% (from over 90% currently) of the energy  basket, as per BP Energy Outlook.
In view of the sustained significance of hydrocarbons  as part of the country’s energy mix, excessive reliance  on imports then predisposes the country to a lot of  externalities.
Rising crude imports has been a longstanding  and distressing feature of our energy economy.
Although  low crude prices during FY’16 and FY’17 did more than  offset the impact of rising import volumes during FY’16  and FY’17, FY’18 brought back the familiar pains that  come with a higher price environment.
For state upstream  companies like ONGC, the perpetual uncertainty  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 89 pertaining to subsidy-sharing resurfaces during periods of  high crude prices.
Rating agency Moody’s has trimmed its  India growth forecast to 7.3%for calendar year 2018 from  a previous projection of 7.5%, citing higher oil prices and  tighter financial conditions.
The Prime Minister’s goal of achieving a 10% reduction  in imports by 2022 is clear statement of the enormity of  the issue in the domestic energy space.
Stronger domestic  hydrocarbon output becomes a vital requirement for  meeting this ambitious goal.
Under such circumstances,  ONGC’s role as the country’s foremost energy explorer  assumes added significance.
While ONGC’s y-o-y production performance has  remained consistent over the years and reserve accretion  track record has been equally positive, we have drawn up  more challenging production milestones and exploration  benchmarks with a view to making consequential  contributions to the goal of import reduction by 2022.
A raft of progressive reforms and policy declarations by  the Govt in the past few years have also set the tone for  a timely reinvigoration of the domestic E&P space.
The  new licensing regime (HELP), premium prices for gas  developed from difficult fields, the launch of Discovered  Small Fields (DSF) bid rounds and Open Acreage  Licensing Policy (OALP) auctions suggest a more  business-friendly administrative setup and a remunerative  operating environment.
Recent outcomes in the sector can be termed encouraging.
The DSF bid round witnessed the entry of new players  into the upstream arena while OALP auctions elicited  strong response from the traditional players of the  hydrocarbon space.
The domestic Hydrocarbon  reassessment program, led by ONGC, has resulted in the  enhancement of prognosticated hydrocarbon resources  from 28.1Btoe (estimated in 1995) to 41.8 Btoe.
National  2D Seismic program, wherein ONGC is the lead agency,  is another important initiative in the upstream space  that is currently underway.
The program expected to be  complete by 2019-20 should make future bid rounds  more attractive for companies.
Crude Oil & Natural Gas production Domestic crude oil production in FY’18 stood at   35.68 Million Metric T onnes (MMT) versus 36.02 MMT  during FY’17.
ONGC’s standalone production was 22.31  MMT vs 22.25 MMT in FY’17 .
Production from Oil  India Ltd and PSC/JVs was 3.38 MMT and 10 MMT  respectively.
Natural Gas output in FY’18 increased to 32.65 Billion  Cubic Metres (BCM), the highest in 3 years, versus 31.90  BCM in FY’17.
This was driven by an over 6% growth in  ONGC domestic output (23.48 BCM) which more than  offset declines in production from Oil India (2.88 BCM)  and other private operators (6.28 BCM).
Consumption of Petroleum Products Domestic liquids consumption in FY’18 totalled ~205  MMT , marking a growth of 5.3% over FY’17 volumes.
This  was the second straight year that oil product demand failed to  match the demand growth of over 11% registered in FY’16 as  the economy adjusted to the twin effects of demonetisation  and the nationwide rollout of GST regime.
Despite the  demand deceleration, growth still remained above the 10  year average (4.8%).
Diesel continued to be the most in-demand product  accounting for almost 40% of the total product volumes.
After  a sharp slowdown in FY’17, demand for the industrial fuel  picked up strongly in FY’18 (+6.6%) on the back of recovery  in economic and manufacturing activity, assembly elections  in states and strong commercial vehicle sales.
Among other  major products, consumption of petrol (+10.1%), LPG  (+8%) and Petroleum Coke (+9.3%) witnessed healthy  growth while demand for Naphtha and kerosene declined.
Looking ahead, IHS-Markit projects a return to a stronger  product demand trajectory in 2018 and 2019 on expectations  for a continued rebound in economic growth, heightened  government spending ahead of key state and general elections,  and the continuation of supportive policies, particularly for LPG  penetration, although higher oil prices could act as a slight drag  on growth for consumer fuels.
Import and Export Crude oil imports grew by 3% in FY’18 to 220.4 MMT ,  less than half of the decadal CAGR of over 6% growth.
This could be explained by the overall slowdown in the  economy which led to across the board dampening of  demand.
However, stronger imports are expected in  the next couple of years in tandem with a strengthening  of domestic demand.
Oil products import declined  marginally to around 36 MMT in FY’18.
Crude oil import bill for FY’18 was `5,659.51billion  (USD 87.76 billion) against `4,701.59 billion (USD  70.19 billion) during FY’17.
The rally in crude prices  has markedly reduced the headroom that the sovereign  exchequer enjoyed during FY’16 and FY’17.
Over the  past two years, crude oil import bill in US dollars has  increased by 37%.
90 Petroleum Products imports for FY’18 stood 35.89 MMT  against 36.28 MMT in FY’17.
Exports stood at 66.75  MMT in FY’18 versus 65.51 MMT in FY’17.
Despite  volume decrease in product imports, value of imports  for FY’18 was 26.4% higher than that in FY’17, driven by  increase in product prices and depreciation of the Rupee  against the Dollar.
Crude oil Price: Indian Basket Crude oil price of the Indian basket averaged USD 56.43  per barrel (`3,636 per barrel) during FY’18 compared to  USD 47.56 per barrel (`3,191 per barrel) in the previous  fiscal (FY’17).
Having recorded a 12 year low in January  2016 when it dropped to below USD 30 a barrel, crude  oil prices today have more than doubled from early 2016.
However, they are still at significantly lower levels than  4 years ago when the basket consistently averaged above  USD 100 a barrel.
That being said, high crude oil prices exert undue stress  on the sovereign coffers of a country with massive  development and infrastructure plans.
As per a research  note from India Ratings, high crude oil prices are likely  to inflate India’s Current Account Deficit (CAD) – excess  of imports of goods and services over exports – in a range  between USD 22 billion and USD 31 billion in the current  financial year ending March 2019.
Under recoveries on sensitive products Under-recovery (including Direct Benefit T ransfer and  Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme) on sensitive fuels  (SKO & LPG) for the fiscal FY’18 was `282.37 billion;  24.2% higher than the fiscal FY’17 (`227.38 billion).
This breaks the declining trend of the previous 4 financial  years.
It still, however, is more than 80% less than the peak  of FY’13 when under-recoveries totalled `1,610 billion.
Rising under-recoveries is a source of fiscal stress for  the Government, especially at a time when oil products  demand is expected to rise.
If prices stay at this level, actual  under-recoveries will easily breach the Government’s  allocation for petroleum subsidy for FY’19 which is `249  billion with the value of a crude barrel pegged at USD  57.50 for the entire year.
According to a post-Budget  report by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, overall under- recoveries at `363 billion for 2018-19 considering average  crude oil prices at USD 62.50 per barrel.
The state upstream companies were required to share  the bill for under-recoveries in just one of the past three  financial years with the Government making good on the  shortfall (combined total of `729.26 billion from FY’16  to FY’18), however, a consistently high price for crude  may alter the existing dynamic.

However, due to the market downturn of the past  few years which negatively affected global energy  commodity prices, the derived value of domestic gas  prices have suffered.
This is a cause for concern for most  domestic upstream players as current prices are lower  than the pre-existing Govt-determined gas price for  nomination-era fields.

Not only does it enable a transparent  and fair price discovery mechanism which motivates  greater participation from companies, sellers and buyers  alike, it also accelerates the pace of infrastructure creation  (pipelines, storage, re-gas facilities etc.).
Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy  (HELP): The Government of India, with an objective of boosting  oil and gas production in the Indian sedimentary Basin,  has formulated and approved a new exploration and  licensing policy named Hydrocarbon Exploration  and Licensing Policy “HELP” vide resolution dated  30.03.2016 whereby it has been determined to provide a  uniform license to enable E&P operators to explore and  extract all hydrocarbons resources including conventional  and non-conventional oil and gas resources.
Pursuant to HELP , Government invited companies to  submit competitive bids to obtain the right to undertake  exploration, discovery and commercial production of  Petroleum resources.
Some of the key aspects of this new  licensing regime are Open Acreage Licensing, uniform  license for all types of hydrocarbons, Revenue sharing  model, marketing and pricing freedom, low royalty for  offshore fields, continuous exploration under contract  period etc.
Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP): T o operationalize the HELP framework, Govt of India  launched the Open Acreage Licensing Programme  (OALP) wherein upstream operators will be allowed to  put in offers for blocks of their choice for contracting based  on the data available in the National Data Repository  (NDR) at any time by submitting an Expression of  Interest (EOI) indicating the area.
OALP is expected  to boost the attractiveness of operating in the domestic  upstream space through seamless and round-the-year  access of G&G data and flexibility to choose contracts  (Petroleum Operations Contract and Reconnaissance  Contract).
So, far, Government has rolled out two OALP  bid rounds.
OALP-I witnessed a total of 110 bids by 9  companies for the 55 blocks that were made available by  DGH.
ONGC submitted e-bids for a total of 37 blocks  (30 blocks as operator and 7 blocks as JV partner).
For  OALP-II, the window for submission of EoIs was open  from 16 Nov 2017 to 15 May 2018.
ONGC has submitted  EoI for 7 nos.
of blocks.
Discovered Small Field Policy: The government announced the Marginal Field Policy  (MFP) in 2015 with a view to incentivize the development  of small and marginal fields which were hitherto deemed  commercially unviable.
Two Discovered Small Fields  (DSF) bid rounds have been conducted on the basis of  the new policy.
DSF-I (2016): It was launched in May 2016 and results  were announced by DGH in February 2017.
A total of  46 contract areas comprising of 67 oil and gas fields (61  previously allocated to ONGC) distributed across nine  sedimentary basins were offered to prospective bidders.
A  total of 134 e-bids were received for 34 Contract areas.
22  companies (singly or in consortium) were shortlisted for  31 Contract Areas.
Of these 22 companies, 15 companies  are new entrants to the E&P sector.
Cumulative peak  production of ~15000 bpd of oil and 2 MMSCMD of gas  from all the awarded fields is anticipated.
DSF-II (2018): The second round of DSFP was notified  by Government of India on 5 th April, 2018.
The current  bid round has put on offer 26 contract areas encompassing  60 small fields covering an area of 3,100 sq km in eight  sedimentary basins with an estimated total hydrocarbons  in place of 1.4 billion boe.
Of these, 46 fields were earlier  allocated to ONGC.
Operational Performance: For FY’18, Oil & Gas production of ONGC Group,  including PSC-JVs and from overseas Assets has been  64.21 MMtoe (against 61.64 MMtoe during FY’17).
ONGC-operated domestic fields accounted for bulk of  the oil and gas production – 64% and 80% respectively.

Opportunities & Threats Market volatility is a real and constant threat to most  energy companies.
Market volatility, more often than not,  is synonymous with extreme price swings.
An extended  period of conspicuously low prices since 2014 through  most of 2017 wiped off billions of dollars of investments  from the sector – thus putting at risk not just growth  of companies, but also the health of several sovereign  economies, particularly ones that are majorly reliant on  energy-export related revenues.
While estimates vary,  anywhere between USD 800 billion to USD 1 trillion  upstream capital spending have been deferred or cancelled  on account of low crude prices.
The implications of this  level of capital-freeze in the short-term is likely to be  manifest in the narrowing pipeline of future oil and gas  supplies within the next few years.
Under such a scenario, ever lower exploration spends  (conventional hydrocarbon discoveries dipped to their  lowest in 2017) and single-digit project FIDs pose a  significant threat and could push the market to the other  end of extremely high prices.
IHS-Markit projects as  much as 43 Million bpd of new liquids may be required  to be produced by companies in 2040 to address energy  demand.
The IEA in one of its reports said that demand and supply  trends point to a tight global oil market and in 2022, spare  production capacity may fall to 14-year low in view of  record two-year investment slump of 2015 and 2016.
Coming to the domestic market, given our level of import  dependence, low oil prices are preferable as it offers  budgetary comfort to the State.
However, it also hampers  the development of indigenous hydrocarbon resources  thereby furthering our reliance on imports.
That being  said, historically, oil demand has not necessarily contracted  in response to higher prices – essentially, reflective of the  significant latent demand and the development stage of  our economy.
India is tipped to be the hub of global energy demand  growth for the next two decades.
Both oil and gas  requirements are projected to register significant gains  during the period.
In view of this rapid expansion of  demand and to ease our reliance on external supplies,  aligned with the Prime Minister’s vision to reduce import  dependence, ONGC has adopted a counter-cyclical  approach to its capital program and project investments.
Against the larger industry-wide trend of decline in  projects FIDs and capital expenditure in recent years, the  Company has signed off on 17 projects with a combined  capex commitment of about `720 billion from FY’15 to  FY’17.
These projects are envisaged to produce 67 MMT  and 118 BCM of additional crude oil and Natural Gas  respectively during their profile period.
The rapid expansion of unconventional hydrocarbons  in the past decade presents a strong opportunity to oil  and gas players of all stripes and sizes to look beyond  conventional deposits and mature basin areas to grow their  portfolio.
While North America led by the remarkably  prolific US shale industry and the substantial resource  base of Canadian oil sands have been at the epicentre  of this seismic shift within the hydrocarbon landscape,  potential for projects elsewhere is also on the rise with  Argentina (Vaca Muerta) and China (Sichuan and Fuling)  being the primary contenders on the basis of current level  of activity and resource size.
While the North American  success may not necessarily translate in other regions, oil  and gas companies must explore the potential with a view  to diversifying future supply sources.
Unconventional hydrocarbons are still at a very nascent  stage within our country.
ONGC operates 4 CBM blocks,  of which Bokaro is at an advanced stage of development.
The Company is also leading the national campaign to  explore the commercial feasibility of Shale Gas as well as  exploring the potential of Gas Hydrates – the latter could  be a game changer in view of the encouraging results of  the NGHP-02 expedition.
The deflated price environment of the last few years has  forced companies to become more operationally efficient  and adopt rigorous capital discipline while sanctioning  and executing projects.
So, from a high-risk high-volume  approach companies today are looking at becoming  leaner.
Creating a sustainable operational and business  model is an opportunity that companies with a longer  view must not pass under current circumstances.
Project  breakevens today are anywhere between 30%-40% lower  than 2014 levels.
Even in exploration, the global tendency  leans more towards near-field exploration and appraisal  that offers greater certainty on returns than conventional  high-risk high-gain wildcats.
While findings costs for ONGC has come down noticeably  in recent years, the same does not hold for our production  costs because of a mature portfolio with legacy contracts.
However, new projects such as our KG-deepwater project  94 certainly do benefit from the reduction in services costs  and rig hiring rates.
However, any such cost deflation must  be set in the context of greater operational complexity and  logistical challenges involved in developing difficult fields  which may necessitate infusion of more capital.
Despite underwhelming proven production potential till  date, the domestic hydrocarbon province is likely to offer  plenty of exciting opportunities for oil and gas explorers  over the next few years.
Our sedimentary basins are still  largely under-explored; however, with the introduction  of HELP , launch of OALP bid rounds and a facilitating  regulatory approach there is strong possibility of increased  upstream activity in our basins.
Our hydrocarbon  resources base already stands significantly upgraded  post the completion of national resource re-estimation  initiative.
The current juncture has also been utilized by traditional  oil and gas companies as a window to rethink existing  business models in order to firm up a blueprint for future  growth and value creation.
Asset divestiture programs  such as undertaken by the likes of BP and Royal Dutch  Shell to focus more on gas business, doubling down on  core expertise opportunities such as Apache’s tilt towards  managing mature life assets or Value-chain integration are  all signifiers of this adaptation of existing frameworks to  new trends and realities.
Closer home, ONGC acquired the state-owned OMC  Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) further consolidating  its downstream business interests.
Considering the  robust growth projections for domestic liquids market,  the HPCL acquisition allows us to remain invested in a  growth market and tap into opportunities therein.
With  HPCL and MRPL, our combined group refining capacity  stands at over 40 MMTPA with a marketing reach of  over 15,000 retail outlets.
The deal presents various  opportunities for the group in future.
Firstly, all else  remaining same, a more balanced upstream-downstream  portfolio provides hedge against oil price volatility,  thereby leading to more stable group earnings.
Secondly,  the strength of the combined balance sheet of ONGC  and HPCL may allow the group to undertake more  ambitious projects with bigger investment requirements,  especially in the competitive and crowded global energy  market.
Finally, with the combined refining capacity of  HPCL and MRPL, there is an opportunity to strike more  advantaged international crude procurement deals.
Also,  there are potential operational efficiencies in marketing  and distribution which both companies may explore.
As per projections by all major agencies, Chemicals and  Petrochemicals segment emerges as one of the major  demand driver in the Oil industry over the next 15-20 years.
The presence of OPaL and OMPL in the petrochemicals  business lends further heft to our downstream portfolio.
The former, one of the largest dual feed crackers in the  world, is projected to reach 100% plant utilisation toward  the end of FY’19 while the latter’s products, of which close  to 80% are exports-oriented, have already established  a niche presence in international markets.
HPCL also  plans to set up sizeable Petrochemicals capacity through  various projects.
These include the proposed refinery  cum petrochemicals complex in Barmer, another  petrochemicals project in Kakinada along with GAIL as  well upcoming petrochemicals capacity in the HMEL  refinery.
Over the years, within most oil and gas firms, the tone  of discussions centered on renewable energy have  moved from being curious and accommodative to  being wary and, even, downright alarmist.
The surge of  renewables of the past decade has come about on the  back of a rapid convergence of technological, economic  and policy advances at a global level (COP-21 in Paris).
The threat is not merely existential as renewables as well  as the increasing EV penetration in the global vehicle  fleet threaten to quickly erode the share of fossil fuels in  energy mix; Capital availability to the upstream sector  is declining because of new climate change concerns,  with the World Bank poised to stop financing upstream  activities beginning in 2019.
In view of these impending changes to the energy order,  the Government of India has envisaged a strategic role for  biofuels in the Indian Energy basket.
The recently notified  biofuels policy 2018 is a testament to government’s focus  in this area.
As per the policy, an indicative target of  20% blending of ethanol in petrol (currently ~2%) and  5% blending of biodiesel in diesel (currently less than  0.1%) is proposed by 2030.
HPCL Biofuels Limited, a  wholly owned subsidiary of HPCL also owns Integrated  Sugar Ethanol Co-gen Plants at Sugauli & Lauriya.
The  Company is also proposing to invest in second generation  (2G) technologies based ethanol production capacities in  Bathinda.
While ONGC continues to be an E&P focused company,  we are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the carbon  intensity of our business.
We have 15 Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) projects that have already earned us  2 million CERs.
We also are among the first few domestic  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 95 companies to have set a target for ‘Carbon Neutrality’ .
As  part of this goal, we are transitioning towards a paperless  office, installing solar lights at our installations and plan to  convert all installed lights to LED by 2020.
We also have a  renewable portfolio of 153 MW wind power.
Amid all the uncertainty that the energy business must  contend with in the foreseeable future, technology  comes across as a ‘critical enabler’ within the strategic  framework of oil and gas companies in a period of  necessary transformation.
Judicious deployment of the  ‘right’ technology has the potential to work as a panacea  in a variety of situations – to blunt the effect of cost  inflation in an environment of rising prices, to tap new oil  in old reserves, to open up new energy frontiers (Arctic,  Gas Hydrates etc.
), to improve safety in operations  etc.
Digitalisation is an emerging opportunity within  the larger realm of technology in upstream operations.
According to Wood Mackenzie, while it is still too early  to quantify the impact on long-term costs and efficiency,  but digitalisation will be at the heart of a low breakeven  future.
As per estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PwC), use of digital technologies in the upstream sector  could result in cumulative savings in capital expenditures  and operating expenditures of USD 100 billion to USD  1 trillion by 2025.
This represents an area of immense  opportunity to a company like ONGC.
5.
Risks and Concerns Oil Price continues to be a source of risk for oil and gas  companies in view of its impact on most operational  decisions and strategic roadmaps.
While calls for hub- based gas prices have grown in recent years, global gas  prices continue to have strong linkages to oil.
If low prices  deter capital investments in the upstream arena raising the  possibility of a shortage of hydrocarbon supplies down  the road, high oil prices often dampen demand leading  to a potential slowdown in GDP growth.
Benchmark  crude prices in 2017 recorded a strong recovery and the  pace is set to intensify in 2018, before plateauing in 2019.
Brent averaged USD 54 in 2017 (vs USD 44 in 2016) and  is projected to average USD 77 in 2018 and USD 75 in  2019, as per IHS-Markit forecast.
US-EIA remains less  bullish – with a forecast price of around USD 63 a barrel  in both 2018 and 2019.
In the domestic energy landscape, a higher price point  translates to an inflated import bill and a heightened  possibility of sharing the OMC under-recoveries by the  state upstream companies.
Rising costs are another source of risk for upstream  operators as activity picks up in response to higher crude  prices and service sector spare capacity dwindles.
As per  a Wood Mackenzie report, lifting costs have plummeted  by 30% in the past 3-4 years.
2017 day rates for deepwater  rigs are 65% below 2014 levels; but, the global service  sector has no more capacity for margin cuts.
Its costs will  rebound by 2019-20, as demand strengthens.
More than the depressed crude prices, it is the low  domestic gas prices that currently poses the bigger risk to  the profitability of upstream business of domestic E&P  operators like ONGC.
The revised gas price of today (at  USD 3.06/mmBtu) is significantly less than the initially  notified revised gas price of USD 5.05/mmBtu, and also  lower than the pre-existing regulated APM gas price of  USD 4.2/mmBtu.
The average cost of production of  natural gas by ONGC (excluding JVs) during 2016-17  and 2017-18 was USD 3.10/mmBtu and USD 3.59/ mmBtu on GCV basis respectively.
Thus, at Govt.
mandated prices, ONGC is incurring significant under- recoveries from its gas business.
Loss of revenues on this  count significantly impairs the company’s ability to fund  its capex plans and hampers most ongoing and future  development projects.
Furthermore, the level of cess imposed on domestically  produced crude oil is another limiting factor to improved  earnings performance.
The 20% ad-valorem at today’s  prices far exceeds the erstwhile flat rate of `4500/tonne,  essentially defeating the entire purpose of modifying the  cess levy.
Moreover, cess incurred by producers is not  recoverable from refineries and thus, forms part of cost  of production of crude oil.
For state upstream companies  like ONGC, the perpetual uncertainty pertaining to  subsidy-sharing that resurfaces during periods of high  crude prices adds another element of risk to its cashflows.
Globally, there is a lot of value that still can be derived from  legacy fields.
As per a Wood Mackenzie report, almost  20% of new production will come from incremental  projects between 2017 and 2025.
ONGC also remains  focused on maximizing recovery from its aging fields - a  total cumulative gain of over 190 MMT of oil is envisaged  from the 28 IOR/EOR schemes that are underway.
Low  crude prices significantly dent the commerciality of such  schemes which are usually higher on the cost-curve.
The  breakeven costs of three consecutive redevelopment  phases since 2000 in Mumbai High North have escalated  from USD30/bbl to USD53/bbl.
The Company remains  96 optimistic of a special EOR pricing regime that incentivizes  augmentation of supplies from our vintage assets.
The issue of demand peaking is now a valid concern in  the industry and can be viewed as a legitimate risk to size  and scope of tomorrow’s oil market.
The not-so-unreal  surge in the EV market accompanied with impressive  advances in battery technology and costs, advent of  driverless technology and mass adoption of ride-sharing  across different markets in the last few years further  reinforce the new realities of this emerging energy matrix  for oil companies as oil consumed in the mobility/ transportation represent a significant chunk of the total  liquids consumed.
Pace of annual oil demand growth in  the long term is projected to slow down to about 260,000  bpd from current levels of over 1 million bpd, as per IHS- Markit.
Notwithstanding the modest pace of growth,  oil, as well as gas, will still be relied upon to cater to the  world’s energy requirements.
BP Energy Outlook projects  oil consumption at 109 million bpd in 2040, from around  96 million bpd in 2016.
While the overall demand trajectory dips from historical  levels, domestic demand for oil products is expected to  be stay strong over the next two decades, as per most  estimates.
That being said, the Indian market also lends  well to disruptions in the mobility segment owing to rising  concerns on air pollution, the urgency to limit reliance  on imports and firm commitments to contain carbon  emissions.
As per a study by FICCI and Rocky Mountain  Institute, transitioning to 100% electric vehicles could  help India save up to USD 300 Bn (` 20 Lakh Crore)  in oil imports and nearly 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide  emissions by 2030.
The current trend of steering E&P investments away  from frontier exploration areas to more near-field  appraisal programs and intensified exploration within  existing acreages and older basins though appropriate  in a cash-constrained climate does not sufficiently  address the level of future hydrocarbon needs of the  world in the context of depletion of existing reserves.
As per Rystad Energy analysis, 2006 was the last year  when the reserve replacement ratio reached 100%.
Forays into unconventional hydrocarbons have not  yielded the dramatic results akin to the North American  experience elsewhere.
Eventually, oil and gas companies  must get back to conventional wildcats as part of their  sustainable resource renewal strategy.
The current low  level of interest in pure-play exploration also offers an  opportunity to companies with the financial bandwidth  to set up a portfolio with an eye on the future.
This along  with reduced costs (especially offshore) and enhanced  fiscal terms (in some regions) make the exploration  opportunity further compelling.
While there is no pullback in conventional exploration  in the domestic upstream arena, the reduced exploration  footprint at the disposal of state upstream firms like ONGC,  however, restricts the potential of an aggressive campaign.
The launch of the HELP regime, as well as DSF and Open  Acreage bid rounds, is expected to address this concern.
The Government plans to hold two bid rounds every  year under HELP; more crucially, the Cabinet decision to  entirely delegate the power to award hydrocarbon blocks  to the MoPNG should go a long way in not just expediting  the award process but also provide much needed acreage  headroom to the domestic E&P players.
Given the geo-strategic and economic significance of  hydrocarbon resources, fiscal and regulatory decisions  of host governments are a constant source of risk in the  oil and gas decisions with any changes to the status quo  either adding to or subtracting from the risk quotient of  the respective regimes.
Stability of sovereign systems is of  particular importance to ONGC in relation to its exposure  to overseas markets through ONGC Videsh’ participation.
The tangible risk of geopolitics resurfaced to prominence  in the latter half of 2017 and continues to influence oil  prices in 2018 with the gradual tightening of markets.
While the list of countries posing geopolitical risk is  largely Middle-East dominant – the biggest risk in terms  of significant oil supply disruptions comes from Iran (on  account of possible reimposition of sanctions by US) and  Venezuela  (with its rampant decline in production from  its aging fields and state of severe sovereign economic  crisis).
While India, of late, has noticeably ramped up  its energy diplomacy efforts with a view to diversifying  its supply sources, flare-up of geopolitical tensions in  resource-rich regions still is a cause of concern for our  import-dependent economy.
The risk of an impending talent crunch in the oil and gas  sector is not one without basis.
Finding the right talent  is extremely critical for success in any industry, but it is  even more so in a technology-intensive and risk-laden  business like upstream oil and gas where the talent pool is  relatively smaller.
In that context, the news of widespread  layoffs/retrenchments during the last couple of years in  the wake of the market collapse could not have come at  a worse time for an industry that now also has to defend  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 97 its position in an increasingly carbon-conscious world.
Moreover, the exodus of experienced hands and veterans  in significant numbers does not help matters either.
With increasing operational complexity, operational  safety becomes a high-risk element for most upstream  operations.
BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster continues to  serve as an unfortunate reminder to companies about the  massive costs of any lapse.
Most well-designed disaster  response/contingency plans and robust HSE frameworks  can go awry on a bad day, however that does not obviate  the need for continuously improving the safety standards  followed within a company.
ONGC has implemented  improved OISD Standards to improve contingency  combat capabilities.
International underwriters, enabling  a lower-than-peer insurance premium for these assets,  have rated ONGC offshore assets under ‘acceptable risk’ .
Y our Company remains the foremost E&P Company  in the country contributing close to 70% of domestic  hydrocarbon supplies.
As we grow as an energy Company  with the objective of catering to domestic energy needs  as well as creating shareholder value, while our focus  on core E&P business will persist, we will also explore  viable business and investment opportunities across  the hydrocarbon value-chain as part of an integrated  energy approach.
Our expanding downstream interests  in refining and petchem, power sector presence and  renewable energy commitments are reflective of the same.

If yes what is  the percentage of recycling of products  and waste (separately as <5%, 5-10%,  >10%).
Also, provide details thereof, in  about 50 words or so.
The Company has a policy for Management of  Hazardous Chemicals and Materials that was  issued in 2002.
As per the policy, personnel  handling hazardous chemical are to be trained for  safe handling practices.
Separate designated areas  are provided for storage of hazardous chemicals  and all personnel are to be provided Personnel  Protective Equipment (PPE) and first aid training.
Further, instructions were issued for the auction/ sale of Hazardous waste in 2004.
The Ministry of  Environment & Forest regulates the recycling/ reprocessing of hazardous wastes such as used/ waste oil, used lead acid batteries and other non- ferrous metal waste under registration scheme, with  the objective of channelizing such waste to only  those units which possess Environmentally Sound  Management (ESM) facilities.
The registration is  being implemented by Central Pollution Control  Board that regularly updates the list of registered  units in their website http://cpcb.delhi.nic.in and the  hazardous waste is required to be sold / auctioned  only to units registered by CPCB.
Thus clear  instructions have been issued and the above policy is  being followed.
For example, all lead acid batteries are  to be sold back to suppliers at the time of purchase of  new batteries.
For disposal of e-waste, the limited tender from  the firms registered with Central Pollution Control  Board for such items is to be invited and the items  of e-waste is to be sold to them only to ensure safe  disposal of the items.
The Company has an e-waste  policy to manage e-waste.
The Company is committed to recycling of materials,  wherever feasible.
ONGC’s Mehsana Asset has  established effective infrastructure to control  expenses, non-optimal usage of costly materials,  ground water and also to effectively manage waste  disposal and has upgraded existing mud preparation  plants through enhancing the mud preparation and  storage capacity.
Mehsana Asset is now transporting the costly  polymer based mud from drill sites to centralized  mud plant for treatment and storage and thereafter  sends to other drill sites, where new wells are  being drilled.
Drilling being most water intensive  operation, recycling of drilling mud has effectively  reduced water consumption.
Waste generated in the Company during  exploration and production operations are  136 primarily drilling fluid and drill cuttings (non- hazardous), chemical sludge and tank bottom  sludge (hazardous).
Chemical sludge is collected  in lagoons having leachate collection facility  where water is drained to reduce the quantity of  sludge.
This chemical sludge is disposed of by  land filling in accordance with norms of the State  Pollution Control Board.
T o treat tank bottom  sludge, which is mainly organic in content, bio- remediation techniques are employed.
Best  practices in the oil industry are adopted to  manage solid waste arising from operations.
Drill mud and cuttings are disposed, re-used in  land filling or sold to authorized vendors as per  industry practices.
Waste management has been identified as  a material issue by ONGC for sustainable  development activities.
Accordingly, ONGC  is working towards development of a waste  management policy and plans to guide and  improve its waste management system.
ONGC has been adopting a three way  strategy to reduce and manage waste: 	 •	 Know your waste footprint – Establish the waste  base line 	 •	 Undertake waste management project wherever  feasible and apply 	 •	 Manage waste & reporting Solid & Oily waste Management Drill cuttings, drilling fluid and generation of oily sludge  from cleaning of storage tanks and from various process  units of effluent treatment plants are few important wastes.
The tank bottom sludge and oily waste were identified as  hazardous waste and is disposed-off according to local  statutory guidelines.
Oily sludge removed periodically  is treated by environmentally sound bioremediation  techniques using a consortium of bacteria known as Oil  Zappers and is rendered non-hazardous.
Land is normally  acquired by ONGC for short duration to carry out its  drilling activities.
The land degradation takes place during  drilling operations due to discharge of waste water from  various sources.
The land acquired for drilling activities  is reclaimed/ restored to its pristine condition before  returning to land owners.
Produced water/ Effluents The Water produced with the oil and gas, is the major  effluent for the Company as part of its production  activities.
The produced water, which is part of well fluid  is separated and sent to Effluent T reatment Plants (ETPs)  for further treatment.
ONGC operates twenty two ETPs  to treat the effluent generated at onshore Installations.
In  order to cope up with enhanced liquid production due  to high water cut because of aging of oil fields, twenty  one new/ substitute ETPs have been planned /under  construction.
At drill sites waste water generated during drilling  activities is collected in a waste pit that is lined with High  Density Poly Ethylene Sheets (HDPE).
The waste water  from waste pit is recycled for mud preparation and other  uses.
In North Eastern Sector, where heavy rainfall takes  place, waste water is treated by mobile ETPs and reused  to avoid overflow of water from waste pits to nearby areas.
In onshore locations, part of treated produced water is  used for water injection into the reservoir for pressure  maintenance; the remaining quantities are re-injected  into sub- surface disposal wells which are deep 1000 mts  underground.
In offshore location, treated produced  water is disposed 40 mts below the sea surface.
The Company has developed a comprehensive corporate  waste management policy to quantify and, segregate  waste at the source for better planning and management.
For non-hazardous wastes, efforts are taken to minimise  the disposable quantity through reuse and recycle route.

In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers  internal financial control relevant to the Company’s  preparation of the standalone Ind AS financial  statements that give a true and fair view in order to  design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances.
An audit also includes evaluating  the appropriateness of the accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates  made by the Company’s Board of Directors as well as  evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone  Ind AS financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our audit opinion on the standalone Ind  AS financial statements.
152 4.
Opinion  In our opinion and to the best of our information  and according to the explanations given to us, the  aforesaid standalone Ind AS financial statements  give the information required by the Act in the  manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India including the Ind AS, of the  financial position of the Company as at 31st March,  2018, and its profit, other comprehensive income,  cash flows and the changes in equity for the year  ended on that date.
5.
Emphasis of Matter  We draw attention to Note 48.1.1(c) of the  standalone Ind AS financial statements, wherein it  is stated that during the year, Directorate General of  Hydrocarbons (DGH) has raised a demand on all  the JV partners of Panna-Mukta and Mid and South  T apti Fields JV (PMT), being BG Exploration  and Production India Limited (BGEPIL) and  Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) (together “the  Claimants”) and the Company and the differential  GOI share of Profit Petroleum and Royalty  alleged to be payable by contractor pursuant to  Government’s interpretation of the Final Partial  Award (40% share of the Company amounting to  US$ 1,574.76 millions equivalent to `102,233.41  millions including interest upto November 30,  2016).
Subsequent to London High Court Orders  dated April 16, 2018 and May 2, 2018, DGH vide  letter dated May 4, 2018 and May 15, 2018 has  asked for re- casting of accounts of the PMT JV and  for remitting the respective PI share of balance dues  including interest till the date of remittance.
As the  Company is not a party to the arbitration, the details  of the proceedings of arbitration and copy of order  of London High Court are not available with the  Company.
The Company has responded that as of  now, neither the Arbitral T ribunal nor the London  High Court has passed any order or quantified  any amount due and payable by the Company and  in the circumstances, the demand of DGH from  the Company for any sum or interest thereon is  premature and not justified.
In the Company’s view,  pending final quantification of liabilities by the  Arbitration T ribunal, it is not liable to implement  the Final Partial Award (FPA) being pre-mature  and therefore no provision for the same has been  considered necessary and the same has been  considered as contingent liability.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
6.
Other Matters  i.
The standalone Ind AS financial statements  include the Company’s share in the total value of  assets, liabilities, expenditure and income of 136  blocks under New Exploration Licensing Policy  (NELP) / Joint Operations ( JOs) accounts  for exploration and production out of which  3 NELP / JOs accounts have been certified by  other Chartered Accountants and 11 NELP  / JOs have been certified by the management  in respect of NELP / JOs operated by other  operators.
In respect of these 11 NELP/ JOs, Ind  AS financial statements include proportionate  share in assets and liabilities as on 31st March,  2018 amounting to `74,914.29 millions and   `54,785.18 millions respectively and revenue  and profit including other comprehensive  Income for the year ended 31st March, 2018  amounting to `82,340.43 millions and   `16,375.29 millions respectively, Our opinion  is based solely on the certificate of the other  Chartered Accountants and management  certified accounts.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the  internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient  conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and  detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of  reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on  our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act,  to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls  and both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated  effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial  reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk  that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
Independent Auditors’ Report 160 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion  on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone Ind AS financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A Company’s internal financial control over  financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of standalone Ind AS financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations  of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the  standalone Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of  collusion or improper management, override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and  not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2018,  based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Application of new Indian Accounting  Standards 2.1 All the Indian Accounting Standards issued under  section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and notified  by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) till the financial  statements are authorized have been considered in  preparation of these Financial Statements.
2.2 Standards issued but not yet effective:  The MCA has notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards/ Ind AS) Amendment  Rules, 2018 on March 28, 2018, whereby Ind AS- 115 relating to “Revenue from Contracts with  Customers” and Appendix B to Ind AS 21 relating  to “Foreign Currency T ransactions and advance  considerations” has been made applicable from  financial year 2018-19 (i.e.
April 1, 2018 onwards).
Ind AS-115 - Revenue from Contracts with  Customers  The Standard replaces the existing Ind AS 18  “Revenue” and Ind AS 11 “Construction Contracts” .
Ind AS 115 establishes the principles that an entity  shall apply to report useful information to users  of financial statements about the nature, amount,  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows  arising from a contract with a customer.
Ind AS 21 – Appendix B - Foreign currency  transactions and advance consideration  This Appendix applies to a foreign currency  transaction (or part of it) when an entity recognises  a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability  arising from the payment or receipt of advance  consideration before the entity recognises the  related asset, expense or income (or part of it).
The Company is evaluating the requirements of the  same and its effect on the Financial Statements.
3.
Significant accounting policies 3.1.
Statement of compliance  In accordance with the notification dated  16th February, 2015, issued by the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs, the Company has adopted Indian  Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”)  issued under section 133 of the Companies Act,  2013 and notified under the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended)  with effect from April 1, 2016.
The Financial Statements have been prepared  in accordance with Ind AS notified under the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) and Guidance Note on  Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities  (Ind AS) issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
3.2.
Basis of preparation  The Financial Statements have been prepared on the  historical cost convention on accrual basis except  for certain assets and liabilities which are measured  at fair value/amortised cost/Net present value at  the end of each reporting period, as explained in the  accounting policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value  of the consideration given in exchange for goods   and services.
As the operating cycle cannot be identified in  normal course due to the special nature of industry,  the same has been assumed to have duration of 12  months.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities have  been classified as current or non-current as per the  Company’s operating cycle and other criteria set out  in Ind AS-1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’  and Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
The Standalone Financial Statements are presented  in Indian Rupees and all values are rounded off to the  nearest two decimal million except otherwise stated.
Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  168 transaction between market participants at the  measurement date under current market conditions.
The Company categorizes assets and liabilities  measured at fair value into one of three levels  depending on the ability to observe inputs employed  in their measurement which are described as  follows: (a) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(b) Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either  directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices  included within level 1 for the asset or liability.
(c) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the  asset or liability reflecting significant modifications  to observable related market data or Company’s  assumptions about pricing by market participants.
3.3.
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and  joint ventures  The Company records the investments in  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at cost less  impairment loss, if any.
When the Company issues financial guarantees  on behalf of subsidiaries, initially it measures  the financial guarantees at their fair values and  subsequently measures at the higher of: i. the amount of loss allowance determined in  accordance with impairment requirements of Ind  AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’; and  ii.
the amount initially recognized less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in accordance with the principles of Ind  AS 18 ‘Revenue’ .
The Company records the initial fair value of  financial guarantee as deemed investment with  a corresponding liability recorded as deferred  revenue under financial guarantee obligation.
Such  deemed investment is added to the carrying amount  of investment in subsidiaries.
Deferred revenue is  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss over  the remaining period of financial guarantee issued  as other income.
On disposal of investment in subsidiary, associate  and joint venture, the difference between net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts  (including corresponding value of dilution in  deemed investment) are recognized in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Interest free loans provided to subsidiary are  recognized at fair value on the date of disbursement  and the difference on fair valuation is recognized  as deemed investment in subsidiary.
Such deemed  investment is added to the carrying amount of  investment in subsidiaries.
Loans are accounted for  at amortized cost method using effective interest  rate.
If there is an early repayment of loan made  by the subsidiary, the proportionate amount of the  deemed investment recognized earlier is adjusted.
3.4.
Interests in joint operations  A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the assets, and obligations for the  liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The Company has Joint Operations in the nature  of Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the  Government of India and various body corporates  for exploration, development and production  activities.
The Company’s share in the assets and liabilities  along with attributable income and expenditure of  the Joint Operations is merged on line by line basis  with the similar items in the Financial Statements  of the Company and adjusted for depreciation,  depletion, survey, dry wells, decommissioning  provision, impairment and sidetracking in  accordance with the accounting policies of the  Company.
The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are taken  in proportion to the participating interest of the  Company.
Gain or loss on sale of interest in a block, is  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  except that no gain is recognized at the time of  such sale if substantial uncertainty exists about  the recovery of the costs applicable to the retained  interest or if the Company has substantial obligation  for future performance.
The gain in such situation is  treated as recovery of cost related to that block.
3.5.
Non-current assets held for sale  Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified  as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be  recovered principally through a sale transaction  Standalone Financial Statements 169 rather than through continuing use.
This condition  is regarded as met only when the sale is highly  probable and the asset or disposal group is available  for immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for sale  of such assets.
Management must be committed to  the sale, which should be expected to qualify for  recognition as a completed sale within one year from  the date of classification as held for sale, and actions  required to complete the plan of sale should indicate  that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan  will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets  are not depreciated or amortized once classified as  held for sale.
3.6 Government Grants  Government grants, including non-monetary  grants at fair value, are not recognised until there is  reasonable assurance that the Company will comply  with the conditions attached to them and that the  grants will be received.
Government grants, whose primary condition is  that the Company should purchase, construct or  otherwise acquire non-current assets and non- monetary grants are recognised and disclosed as  ‘deferred income’ under non-current liability in the  Balance Sheet and transferred to the Statement of  Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis  over the useful lives of the related assets.
3.7 Property, Plant and Equipment (other than  Oil and Gas Assets)  The Company had elected to continue with the  carrying value of all of its Property, Plant and  Equipment recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition  date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and  used that carrying value as its deemed cost as of  the transition date except adjustment related to  decommissioning provisions.
Land and buildings held for use in the production  or supply of goods or services, or for administrative  purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if  any.
Freehold land and land under perpetual lease  are not depreciated.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the  course of construction for production, supply or  administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any  recognised impairment loss.
The cost of an asset  comprises its purchase price or its construction  cost (net of applicable tax credits), any cost directly  attributable to bring the asset into the location and  condition necessary for it to be capable of operating  in the manner intended by the Management and  decommissioning cost as per Note no 3.13.
It includes  professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing  costs capitalised in accordance with the Company’s  accounting policy.
Such properties are classified to  the appropriate categories of PPE when completed  and ready for intended use.
Parts of an item of  PPE having different useful lives and significant  value and subsequent expenditure on Property,  Plant and Equipment arising on account of capital  improvement or other factors are accounted for as  separate components.
Expenditure on dry docking  of rigs and vessels are accounted for as component of  relevant assets.
Depreciation of PPE commences when the assets  are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  (other than freehold land, Oil and Gas Assets and  properties under construction) less their residual  values, using the written down value method  (except for components of dry docking capitalised)  over the useful life of PPE as stated in the Schedule  II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  assessment by the Company.
Estimated useful lives  of these assets are as under: Description Years Building & Bunk Houses 3 to 60 Plant & Machinery 2 to 40 Furniture & Fixtures 3 to 15 Vehicles, Ships & Boats 5 to 20 Office Equipment 2 to 20  The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed on an annual  basis and if necessary, changes in estimates are  accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation on additions/deletions to PPE (other  than of Oil and Gas Assets) during the year is  provided for on a pro-rata basis with reference to the  date of additions/deletions except low value items  not exceeding `5,000/- which are fully depreciated  at the time of addition.
Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE  (other than of Oil and Gas Assets) arising on account  of capital improvement or other factors is provided  for prospectively over the remaining useful life.
170  Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE (other  than of Oil and Gas Assets) which are capitalized  separately is provided for over the reassessed useful life.
Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking of rigs  and vessels capitalized as component of relevant  rig / vessels is charged over the dry dock period on  straight line basis.
Depreciation on PPE (other than Oil and Gas Assets)  including support equipment and facilities used  for exploratory/ development drilling is initially  capitalised as part of drilling cost and expensed  / depleted as per note no.
3.11.
Depreciation on  equipment/ assets deployed for survey activities is  charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated  over their expected useful lives on the same basis as  owned assets.
An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to arise  from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss  arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PPE  is determined as the difference between the net sales  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.8 Intangible Assets  (i) Intangible assets acquired separately   The Company had elected to continue with  the carrying value of all of its intangible assets  recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition date)  measured as per the Previous GAAP and used  that carrying value as its deemed cost as of the  transition date.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that  are acquired separately are carried at cost less  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis  over their estimated useful lives not exceeding  five years from the date of capitalisation.
The  estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of each  reporting period and the effect of any changes in  estimate is accounted for prospectively.
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal,  or when no future economic benefits are  expected from use or disposal.
Gains or losses  arising from derecognition of an intangible asset  are determined as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset, and recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
(ii) Intangible assets under development -  Exploratory Wells in Progress    All exploration and evaluation costs incurred in  drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal  wells, are initially capitalized as Intangible  assets under development - Exploratory  Wells in Progress till the time these are either  transferred to Oil and Gas Assets on completion  as per note no.3.11 or expensed as exploration  and evaluation cost (including allocated  depreciation) as and when determined to be dry  or of no further use, as the case may be.
Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic  test wells are initially capitalized as Intangible  assets under development - Exploratory  Wells in Progress till the time these are either  transferred to Oil and Gas Assets as per note no.
3.11 or expensed as exploration and evaluation  cost (including allocated depreciation) as  when determined to be dry or the Petroleum  Exploration License is surrendered.
Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over  unless it could be reasonably demonstrated that  there are indications of sufficient quantity of  reserves and sufficient progress has been made  in assessing the reserves and the economic and  operating viability of the project.
All such carried  over costs are subject to review for impairment  as per the policy of the Company.
3.9 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  The Company reviews the carrying amount of  its tangible and intangible assets (Oil and Gas  Assets, Development Wells in Progress (DWIP),  and Property, Plant and Equipment (including  Capital Works-in-Progress) of a “Cash Generating  Unit” (CGU) at the end of each reporting period  to determine whether there is any indication that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If  any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  of the asset is estimated in order to determine the  extent of the impairment loss (if any).
When it is  not possible to estimate the recoverable amount  of an individual asset, the Company estimates the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to  which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value  Standalone Financial Statements 171 in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted  to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate  that reflects current market assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have not  been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its  carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable  amount and impairment loss is recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
An assessment is made at the end of each reporting  period to see if there are any indications that  impairment losses recognized earlier, may no longer  exist or may have come down.
The impairment  loss is reversed, if there has been a change in the  estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable  amount since the previous impairment loss was  recognized.
If it is so, the carrying amount of the asset  is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount  and the carrying amount that have been determined,  net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been  recognized for the asset in prior years.
After a reversal,  the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods  to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less  any residual value, on a systematic basis over its  remaining useful life.
Reversals of Impairment loss  are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for  Impairment when further exploration activities  are not planned in near future or when sufficient  data exists to indicate that although a development  is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the  exploration asset is unlikely to be recovered in full  from successful development or by sale.
Impairment  loss is reversed subsequently, to the extent that  conditions for impairment are no longer present.
3.10 Exploration & Evaluation, Development  and Production Costs   (i) Pre-acquisition cost   Expenditure incurred before obtaining the  right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil and  gas are expensed as and when incurred.
(ii) Acquisition cost   Acquisition costs of Oil and Gas Assets are costs  related to right to acquire mineral interest and  are accounted as follows:-   Exploration and development stage   Acquisition cost relating to projects under  exploration or development are initially  accounted as Intangible Assets under  development - exploratory wells in progress  or Oil & Gas Assets under development -  development wells in progress respectively.
Such costs are capitalized by transferring to  Oil and Gas Assets when a well is ready to  commence commercial production.
In case of  abandonment / relinquishment of Intangible  Assets under development - exploratory wells in  progress, such costs are written off.
Production stage   Acquisition costs of producing Oil and Gas  Assets are capitalized as proved property  acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets and  amortized using the unit of production method  over proved reserves of underlying assets.
(iii) Survey cost   Cost of Survey and prospecting activities  conducted in the search of oil and gas are  expensed as exploration cost in the year in which  these are incurred.
(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development -  Development Wells in Progress   All costs relating to Development Wells are  initially capitalized as ‘Development Wells in  Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas Assets’  on “completion” .
(v) Production costs   Production costs include pre-well head and post- well head expenses including depreciation and  applicable operating costs of support equipment  and facilities.
3.11 Oil and Gas Assets  The Company had elected to continue with the  carrying value of all of its Oil and Gas assets recognised  as of April 1, 2015 (transition date) measured as per  the Previous GAAP and used that carrying value  as its deemed cost as of the transition date except  adjustment related to decommissioning provisions.
Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost less  accumulated depletion and impairment losses.
These are created in respect of an area / field  having proved developed oil and gas reserves, when  172 the well in the area / field is ready to commence  commercial production.
Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful  exploratory wells, all development wells (including  service wells), allied facilities, depreciation on  support equipment used for drilling and estimated  future decommissioning costs are capitalised and  classified as Oil and Gas Assets.
Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit  of Production Method” .
The rate of depletion is  computed with reference to an area covered by  individual lease/license/asset/amortization base  by considering the proved developed reserves and  related capital costs incurred including estimated  future decommissioning / abandonment costs  net of salvage value.
Acquisition cost of Oil and  Gas Assets is depleted by considering the proved  reserves.
These reserves are estimated annually by  the Reserve Estimates Committee of the Company,  which follows the International Reservoir  Engineering Procedures.
3.12 Side tracking  In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side- tracking is treated in the same manner as the cost  incurred on a new exploratory well.
The cost of  abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory wells  is expensed as ‘Exploration cost written off ’ .
In the case of development wells, the entire cost of  abandoned portion and side tracking is capitalized.
In the case of producing wells and service wells,  if the side-tracking results in additional proved  developed oil and gas reserves or increases the future  economic benefits therefrom beyond previously  assessed standard of performance, the cost incurred  on side tracking is capitalised, whereas the cost of  abandoned portion of the well is depleted in the  normal way.
Otherwise, the cost of side tracking is  expensed as ‘Work over Expenditure’ .
3.13 Decommissioning costs  Decommissioning cost includes cost of restoration.
Provision for decommissioning costs is recognized  when the Company has a legal or constructive  obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle  and remove a facility or an item of Property, Plant  and Equipment and to restore the site on which it  is located.
The full eventual estimated provision  towards costs relating to dismantling, abandoning and  restoring well sites and allied facilities are recognized in  respective assets when the well is complete / facilities  or Property, Plant and Equipment are installed.
The amount recognized is the present value of the  estimated future expenditure determined using  existing technology at current prices and escalated  using appropriate inflation rate till the expected  date of decommissioning and discounted up to  the reporting date using the appropriate risk free  discount rate.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning  provision is recognized along with the cost of  exploratory well or Property, Plant and Equipment.
The decommissioning cost in respect of dry well is  expensed as exploratory well cost.
Any change in the present value of the estimated  decommissioning provision other than the  periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted to the  decommissioning provision and the corresponding  carrying value of the related asset.
In case reversal  of decommissioning provision exceeds the  corresponding carrying amount of the related asset,  the excess amount is recognized in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
The unwinding of discount on  provision is charged in the Statement of Profit and  Loss as finance cost.
Provision for decommissioning cost in respect of  assets under Joint Operations is considered as per  participating interest of the Company on the basis  of estimates approved by the respective operating  committee.
Wherever the same are not approved by  the respective operating committee, decommissioning  cost estimates of the company are considered.
3.14 Inventories  Finished goods (other than Sulphur) including  inventories in pipelines / tanks and carbon credits  are valued at cost or net realisable value whichever  is lower.
Cost of finished goods is determined on  absorption costing method.
Sulphur is valued at net  realisable value.
The value of inventories includes  excise duty, royalty (wherever applicable) but  excludes cess.
Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group  Gathering Stations (GGS) is valued at cost on  absorption costing method or net realisable value  whichever is lower.
Standalone Financial Statements 173  Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines up  to GGS / platform is not valued as the same is not  measurable.
Natural Gas is not valued as it is not stored.
Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued at  weighted average cost or net realisable value,  whichever is lower.
Provisions are made for obsolete  and non-moving inventories.
Unserviceable and scrap items, when determined,  are valued at estimated net realisable value.
3.15 Revenue recognition   Revenue arising from sale of products is recognized  when the significant risks and rewards of ownership  have passed to the buyer, which is at the point of  transfer of custody to customers, and the amount of  revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable  that the economic benefits associated with the  transaction will flow to the Company.
Revenue from services is recognized when the  outcome of services can be estimated reliably and  it is probable that the economic benefits associated  with rendering of services will flow to the Company,  and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable and represents  amounts receivable for goods and services provided  in the normal course of business, net of discounts,  service tax / Goods and Services T ax (GST) /  sales tax etc.
Any retrospective revision in prices is  accounted for in the year of such revision.
Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of levies)  produced from Intangible assets under development  – Exploratory Wells in Progress / Oil and Gas  assets under development – Development Wells  in Progress is deducted from expenditure on such  wells.
Revenue in respect of the following is recognized  when there is a reasonable certainty regarding  ultimate collection:  (i) Short lifted quantity of gas  (ii) Surplus from Gas Pool Account  (iii) Interest on delayed realization from customers  and cash calls from JV partners  (iv) Liquidated damages from contractors/suppliers  As per the Production Sharing Contracts for extracting  the Oil and Gas Reserves with Government of India,  out of the earnings from the exploitation of reserves  after recovery of cost, a part of the revenue is paid to  Government of India which is called Profit Petroleum.
It is reduced from the revenue from Sale of Products  as Government of India’s Share in Profit Petroleum.
Dividend and interest income  Dividend income from investments is recognised  when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is  established.
Interest income from financial assets is recognised  at the effective interest rate method applicable on  initial recognition.
3.16 Leases  Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the  terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks  and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset  to the Company.
All other leases are classified as  operating leases.
Land under perpetual lease is accounted as finance  lease which is recognized at upfront premium paid  for the lease and the present value of the lease rent  obligation.
The corresponding liability is recognised  as a finance lease obligation.
Land under non- perpetual lease is treated as operating lease.
Operating lease payments for land are recognized as  prepayments and amortised on a straight-line basis  over the term of the lease.
Contingent rentals, if any,  arising under operating leases are recognised as an  expense in the period in which they are incurred.
3.17 Foreign Exchange T ransactions  The functional currency of the Company is Indian  Rupees which represents the currency of the primary  economic environment in which it operates.
T ransactions in currencies other than the Company’s  functional currency (foreign currencies) are  recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the  dates of the transactions.
At the end of each reporting  period, monetary items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using mean exchange rate  prevailing on the last day of the reporting period.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the  period in which they arise.
3.18 Employee Benefits  Employee benefits include salaries, wages,  Contributory provident fund, gratuity, leave  174 encashment towards un-availed leave, compensated  absences, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits.
All short term employee benefits are recognized  at their undiscounted amount in the accounting  period in which they are incurred.
Defined Contribution plans  Employee Benefit under defined contribution plans  comprising Contributory provident fund, Post  Retirement benefit scheme, Employee pension  scheme-1995, composite social security scheme etc.
is recognized based on the undiscounted amount  of obligations of the Company to contribute to  the plan.
The same is paid to a fund administered  through a separate trust.
Defined benefit plans  Defined retirement benefit plans comprising of  gratuity, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits, are recognized based on  the present value of defined benefit obligation  which is computed using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period.
These  are accounted either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Net interest on the net defined liability is calculated  by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the  period to the net defined benefit liability or asset  and is recognised the Statement of Profit and Loss  except those included in cost of assets as permitted.
Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit plans  except for leave encashment towards un-availed  leave and compensated absences, comprising  actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes  to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return  on plan assets (excluding net interest as defined  above), are recognised in other comprehensive  income except those included in cost of assets as  permitted in the period in which they occur and are  not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities  with respect to gratuity and un-availed leave to the  ONGC’s Gratuity Fund T rust (OGFT) and Life  Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), respectively.
Other defined benefit schemes are unfunded.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the  Financial Statements represents the actual deficit or  surplus in the Company’s defined benefit plans.
Any  surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to  the present value of any economic benefits available  in the form of reductions in future contributions to  the plans.
Other long term employee benefits  Other long term employee benefit comprises of  leave encashment towards un-availed leave and  compensated absences, these are recognized  based on the present value of defined obligation  which is computed using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period.
These  are accounted either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Re-measurements of leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences are  recognized in the Statement of profit and loss except  those included in cost of assets as permitted in the  period in which they occur.
3.19 Voluntary Retirement Scheme  Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS) is charged to the Statement of Profit and  Loss when incurred.
3.20 General Administrative Expenses  General administrative expenses which are directly  attributable are allocated to activities and the  balance is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.21 Insurance claims  The Company accounts for insurance claims as  under:-  In case of total loss of asset, by transferring either  the carrying cost of the relevant asset or insurance  value (subject to deductibles), whichever is lower  under the head “Claims Recoverable - Insurance”  on intimation to Insurer.
In case insurance claim is  less than carrying cost, the difference is charged to  Statement of Profit and Loss.
In case of partial or other losses, expenditure  incurred/payments made to put such assets back  into use, to meet third party or other liabilities  (less policy deductibles) if any, are accounted for  as “Claims Recoverable-Insurance” .
Insurance  Policy deductibles are expensed in the year the  corresponding expenditure is incurred.
Standalone Financial Statements 175  As and when claims are finally received from the  insurer, the difference, if any, between Claims  Recoverable-Insurance and claims received is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.22 Research and Development Expenditure  Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and  expenses of revenue nature are charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss, as and when incurred.
3.23 Income T axes  Income tax expense represents the sum of the  current tax and deferred tax.
(i) Current tax   The tax currently payable is based on taxable  profit for the year.
T axable profit differs from  ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement  of Profit and Loss because of items of income  or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and items that are never taxable  or deductible.
The Company’s current tax is  calculated using tax rates and laws that have been  enacted or substantively enacted by the end of  the reporting period.
(ii) Deferred tax   Deferred tax is recognised on temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements  and the corresponding tax bases used in the  computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax  liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable  temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are  generally recognised for all deductible temporary  differences to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profits will be available against which those  deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at the end of each reporting period  and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profits will be  available to allow all or part of the deferred tax  asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  period in which the liability is settled or the asset  realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would  follow from the manner in which the Company  expects, at the end of the reporting period, to  recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets  and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum  Alternative T ax (MAT) paid in accordance with  the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future  economic benefits in the form of availability  of set off against future income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax  asset in the balance sheet when the asset can  be measured reliably and it is probable that the  future economic benefit associated with asset  will be realised.
(iii) Current and deferred tax expense for the year   Current and deferred tax expense is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except when  they relate to items that are recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, in  which case, the current and deferred tax are also  recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity respectively.
3.24 Borrowing Costs  Borrowing costs specifically identified to the  acquisition or construction of qualifying assets is  capitalized as part of such assets.
A qualifying asset is  one that necessarily takes substantial period of time  to get ready for intended use.
All other borrowing  costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and  Loss.
3.25 Rig Days Costs  Rig movement costs are booked to the next location  drilled/planned for drilling.
Abnormal Rig days’  costs are considered as un-allocable and charged to  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.26 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets  Provisions are recognised when the Company  has a present obligation (legal or constructive)  as a result of a past event, it is probable that the  Company will be required to settle the obligation,  and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  of the obligation.
176  The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  taking into account the risks and uncertainties  surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is  measured using the cash flows estimated to settle  the present obligation, its carrying amount is the  present value of those cash flows (when the effect of  the time value of money is material).
Contingent assets are disclosed in the Financial  Statements by way of notes to accounts when an  inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Financial  Statements by way of notes to accounts, unless  possibility of an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefit is remote.
3.27 Financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are  recognised when Company becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value.
T ransaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of  financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss) are added to or deducted  from the fair value of the financial assets or financial  liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
T ransaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities  at fair value through profit or loss are recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.28 Equity instruments  Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded  at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
3.29 Financial assets  (i) Cash and cash equivalents    The Company considers all highly liquid  financial instruments, which are readily  convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value  and having original maturities of three months  or less from the date of purchase, to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist  of balances with banks which are unrestricted  for withdrawal and usage.
(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost    Financial assets are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest  method if these financial assets are held within  a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms of the financial asset  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if these  financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial  assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest  on the principal amount outstanding.
The Company has made an irrevocable election  to present in other comprehensive income  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading.
(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through profit or loss unless it is measured at  amortised cost or at fair value through other  comprehensive income on initial recognition.
(v) Impairment of financial assets    The Company assesses at each balance sheet  date whether a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires  expected credit losses to be measured through  a loss allowance.
The Company recognises  lifetime expected losses for trade receivables that  do not constitute a financing transaction.
For  all other financial assets, expected credit losses  are measured at an amount equal to 12 month  expected credit losses or at an amount equal to  lifetime expected losses, if the credit risk on the  financial asset has increased significantly since  initial recognition.
(vi) Derecognition of financial assets   The Company derecognises a financial asset  when the contractual rights to the cash flows from  Standalone Financial Statements 177 the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial  asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety (except for equity instruments  designated as FVTOCI), the difference between  the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of  the consideration received and receivable is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.30 Financial liabilities   (a) Financial guarantee contracts   A financial guarantee contract is a contract that  requires the issuer to make specified payments to  reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a  specified debtor fails to make payments when due  in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the  Company are initially measured at their fair  values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are  subsequently measured at the higher of:  i. the amount of loss allowance determined in  accordance with impairment requirements of  Ind AS 109; and  ii.
the amount initially recognised less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in accordance with the principles of  Ind AS 18.
[Note no.
3.3 for Financial guarantee  issued to subsidiaries]   (b) Financial liabilities    Financial liabilities are measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest method.
(c) Derecognition of financial liabilities   The Company derecognises financial liabilities  when, and only when, the Company’s obligations  are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The  difference between the carrying amount of  the financial liability derecognised and the  consideration paid and payable is recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.31 Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the  net profit after tax by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted  earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit  after tax by the weighted average number of equity  shares considered for deriving basic earnings per  share and also the weighted average number of equity  shares that could have been issued upon conversion  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
3.32 Statement of Cash Flows   Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby profit after tax is adjusted for the effects of  transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or  accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and item of income or expenses associated  with investing or financing cash flows.
The cash  flows are segregated into operating, investing and  financing activities.
3.33 Segment reporting  Operating segments are identified and reported  taking into account the different risks and returns,  the organization structure and the internal reporting  systems.
4.
Critical Accounting Judgments,  Assumptions and Key Sources of  Estimation Uncertainty  Inherent in the application of many of the  accounting policies used in preparing the Financial  Statements is the need for Management to make  judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and  assumptions used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
Key source of judgments, assumptions and  estimation uncertainty in the preparation of the  Financial Statements which may cause a material  adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities within the next financial year, are in respect  of Oil and Gas reserves, long term production  profile, impairment, useful lives of Property, Plant  and Equipment, depletion of oil and gas assets,  decommissioning provision, employee benefit  obligations, impairment, provision for income tax,  measurement of deferred tax assets and contingent  assets and liabilities.
178 4.1 Critical judgments in applying accounting  policies  The following are the critical judgements, apart from  those involving estimations (Note no.
4.2), that the  Management have made in the process of applying  the Company’s accounting policies and that have  the significant effect on the amounts recognized in  the Financial Statements.
(a) Determination of functional currency   Currency of the primary economic environment  in which the Company operates (“the functional  currency”) is Indian Rupee (`) in which the  Company primarily generates and expends cash.
Accordingly, the Management has assessed its  functional currency to be Indian Rupee (`).
(b) Classification of investment    Judgement is required in assessing the level of  control obtained in a transaction to acquire  an interest in another entity; depending upon  the facts and circumstances in each case, the  Company may obtain control, joint control  or significant influence over the entity or  arrangement.
T ransactions which give the  Company control of a business are business  combinations.
If the Company obtains joint  control of an arrangement, judgement is also  required to assess whether the arrangement  is a joint operation or a joint venture.
If the  Company has neither control nor joint control,  it may be in a position to exercise significant  influence over the entity, which is then classified  as an associate.
The Company has 49.36% equity interest in  ONGC Petro additions Limited (OPaL).
The  Company has also subscribed for 1,922 million  share warrants on August 25, 2015 entitling the  Company to exchange each warrant with an  equity share of face value of `10 each against  which `9.75 each has been paid.
Further the Company has also entered into an  arrangement on July 2, 2016 for backstopping  support towards repayment of principal and  cumulative coupon amount for compulsorily  convertible debentures amounting to   `77,780.00 million issued by ONGC Petro  additions Limited and interest for the year ending  March 31, 2018 amounting to `4,670.19 million.
The Management has however evaluated the  interest in OPaL to be in the nature of joint  venture as the shareholder agreement between  all the shareholders provides for sharing of  control of the decisions of relevant activities that  require the unanimous consent of all the parties  sharing control.
(c) Determining whether an arrangement  contain leases and classification of leases   The Company enters into service / hiring  arrangements for various assets / services.
The  determination of lease and classification of the  service / hiring arrangement as a finance lease  or operating lease is based on an assessment  of several factors, including, but not limited  to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end  of lease term, lessee’s option to purchase and  estimated certainty of exercise of such option,  proportion of lease term to the asset’s economic  life, proportion of present value of minimum  lease payments to fair value of leased asset and  extent of specialized nature of the leased asset.
(d) Evaluation of indicators for impairment of  Oil and Gas Assets   The evaluation of applicability of indicators of  impairment of assets requires assessment of  external factors (significant decline in asset’s  value, significant changes in the technological,  market, economic or legal environment,  market interest rates etc.)
and internal factors  (obsolescence or physical damage of an asset,  poor economic performance of the asset etc.)
which could result in significant change in  recoverable amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.
(e) Oil & Gas Accounting   The determination of whether potentially  economic oil and natural gas reserves have been  discovered by an exploration well is usually  made within one year of well completion, but  can take longer, depending on the complexity  of the geological structure.
Exploration wells  that discover potentially economic quantities of  oil and natural gas and are in areas where major  capital expenditure (e.g.
an offshore platform or  a pipeline) would be required before production  could begin, and where the economic viability  of that major capital expenditure depends on  the successful completion of further exploration  Standalone Financial Statements 179 work in the area, remain capitalized on the  balance sheet as long as additional exploration  or appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
It is not unusual to have exploration wells  and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells  remaining suspended on the balance sheet  for several years while additional appraisal  drilling and seismic work on the potential oil  and natural gas field is performed or while the  optimum development plans and timing are  established.
All such carried costs are subject to  regular technical, commercial and management  review on at least an annual basis to confirm  the continued intent to develop, or otherwise  extract value from the discovery.
Where this is  no longer the case, the costs are immediately  expensed.
4.2 Assumptions and key sources of estimation  uncertainty  Information about estimates and assumptions  that have the significant effect on recognition and  measurement of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses is provided below.
Actual results may  differ from these estimates.
(a) Estimation of provision for decommissioning    The Company estimates provision for  decommissioning as per the principles of  Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets’ for the future  decommissioning of Oil and Gas assets at the  end of their economic lives.
Most of these  decommissioning activities would be in the  future, the exact requirements that may have  to be met when the removal events occur  are uncertain.
T echnologies and costs for  decommissioning are constantly changing.
The  timing and amounts of future cash flows are  subject to significant uncertainty.
The timing and amount of future expenditures  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,  together with rate of inflation for escalation of  current cost estimates and the interest rate used  in discounting the cash flows.
The economic  life of the Oil and Gas assets is estimated on  the basis of long term production profile of  the relevant Oil and Gas asset.
The General  Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation i.e.
4.28% (Previous year 3.81%) has been used  for escalation of the current cost estimates and  pre- tax discounting rate used to determine the  balance sheet obligation as at the end of the year  is 7.56% (Previous year 7.12%), which is the risk  free government bond rate with 10 year yield.
(b) Determination of cash generating unit (CGU)   The Company is engaged mainly in the business  of oil and gas exploration and production in  Onshore and Offshore.
In case of onshore  assets, the fields are using common production/ transportation facilities and are sufficiently  economically interdependent to constitute a  single cash generating unit (CGU).
Accordingly,  impairment test of all onshore fields is performed  in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field is generally  considered as CGU except for fields which  are developed as a Cluster, for which common  facilities are used, in which case the impairment  testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields  included in the cluster.
(c) Impairment of assets   Determination as to whether, and by how  much, a CGU is impaired involves Management  estimates on uncertain matters such as future  crude oil, natural gas and value added product  (VAP) prices, the effects of inflation on operating  expenses, discount rates, production profiles for  crude oil, natural gas and value added products.
For Oil and Gas assets, the expected future  cash flows are estimated using Management’s  best estimate of future crude oil and natural gas  prices, production and reserves volumes.
The present values of cash flows are determined  by applying pre tax-discount rates of 14.48%  (previous year 14.88%) for Rupee transactions  and 9.68% (previous year 10.57%) for crude  oil and value added products revenue, which  are measured in USD.
Future cash inflows from  sale of crude oil and value added products are  computed using the future prices, on the basis  of market-based average prices of the Dated  Brent crude oil as per assessment by ‘Platt’s  Crude Oil Market wire’ and its co-relations  with benchmark crudes and other petroleum  products.
Future cash flows from sale of natural  gas are also computed based on the expected  future prices on the basis of the notification  issued by the Government of India (GoI) and  discounted applying the rate applicable to the  180 cash flows measured in USD in view of the new  pricing guidelines issued by GoI.
The discount rate used is based upon the cost of  capital from an established model.
The value in use of the producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage approach,  wherein future cash flows are initially estimated  based on Proved Developed Reserves.
Under  circumstances where the further development  of the fields in the CGUs is under progress and  where the carrying value of the CGUs is not  likely to be recovered through exploitation of  proved developed reserves alone, the Proved and  probable reserves (2P) of the CGUs are also taken  for the purpose of estimating future cash flows.
In such cases, full estimate of the expected cost of  evaluation/development is also considered while  determining the value in use.
The discount rates applied in the assessment of  impairment calculation are re-assessed each year.
(d) Estimation of reserves   Management estimates production profile  (proved and developed reserves) in relation to  all the Oil and Gas Assets based on the policies  and procedures determined by the Reserves  Estimation Committee of the Company (REC).
The estimates so determined are used for the  computation of depletion and impairment testing.
The year-end reserves of the Company are  estimated by the REC which follows international  reservoir engineering procedures consistently.
The Company has adopted deterministic  approach for reserves estimation and is following  Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) – 1997  guidelines which defines reserves as “estimated  volumes of crude oils, condensate, natural gas,  natural gas liquids and associated substances  anticipated to be commercially recoverable  from known accumulations from a given date  forward, under existing economic conditions,  by established operating practices, and under  current Government regulations.
” Volumetric  estimation is the main procedure in estimation,  which uses reservoir rock and fluid properties to  calculate hydrocarbons in-place and then estimate  that portion which will be recovered from it.
As the field gets matured with reasonably good  production history available then performance  methods such as material balance, simulation,  decline curve analysis are applied to get more  accurate assessments of reserves.
The annual revision of estimates is based on the  yearly exploratory and development activities  and results thereof.
New in-place Volume and  Ultimate Reserves are estimated for new field  discoveries or new pool discoveries in already  discovered fields.
Also, appraisal activities lead to  revision in estimates due to new sub-surface data.
Similarly, reinterpretation exercise is also carried  out for old fields due to necessity of revision in  petro-physical parameters, updating of static  and dynamic models and performance analysis  leading to change in reserves.
Intervention of  new technology, change in classifications and  contractual provisions also necessitate revision  in estimation of reserves.
The Company uses the services of third party  agencies for due diligence and it gets the reserves  of its assets audited by third party periodically by  internationally reputed consultants who adopt  latest industry practices for their evaluation.
(e) Defined benefit obligation (DBO)    Management’s estimate of the DBO is  based on a number of critical underlying  assumptions such as standard rates of  inflation, medical cost trends, mortality,  discount rate and anticipation of future salary  increases.
Variation in these assumptions may  significantly impact the DBO amount and the  annual defined benefit expenses.

BGEPIL along with RIL (“Claimants”) have served a notice of  arbitration on the GoI in respect of dispute, differences and claims arisen in connection with the terms of Panna,  Mukta and T apti PSCs.
Since the Company is not a party to the arbitration proceedings, it had requested MoP&NG  that in case of an arbitral award the same be made applicable to ONGC also, as a constituent of contractor for  both the PSCs.
Subsequently, vide letter dated July 4, 2011 MoP&NG has advised ONGC not to participate in the  arbitration initiated by RIL and BGEPIL under Panna Mukta and T apti PSCs.
MoP&NG has also stated that in case  of an arbitral award, the same will be applicable to ONGC also as a constituent of the contractor for both the PSCs.

The Company is not a party to the dispute but has agreed to abide by the decision applicable to  the operator.

The  Federal Court of Malaysia, vide its order dated October 11, 2011, has dismissed the said appeal of the GoI.
The Company has taken up the matter regarding refund of the recoveries made in view of the favorable judgment  of the Federal Court of Malaysia with MoP&NG.

According to the JO Partners, Delivery Point for Panna- Mukta gas is at Offshore, however, MoP&NG and GAIL maintained that the delivery point is onshore at Hazira.
The gas produced from Panna-Mukta fields was transported through Company’s pipelines.
Owing to the delivery  point dispute neither the seller (PMT JO) nor the buyer of gas (GAIL) was paying any compensation to  ONGC for  usage of its pipeline for gas transportation.
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court decided that the Panna Mukta oil fields from where the movement of goods is  occasioned fall within the customs frontiers of India.
Consequently, the sale of goods cannot be said to have taken  place in the course of import of goods into the territory of India.
The state Government of Gujarat has filed a  petition with the  Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the decision of Hon’ble Gujarat High Court.
Since the said matter of determination of delivery point is pending with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, the  amount is maintained in the escrow accounts by the JO Partners.

42.5.6 These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity  risk and salary risk.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by  reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
When there is a deep market  for such bonds; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently, for these  plans, investments are made in government securities, debt instruments, Short term debt instruments, Equity  instruments and Asset Backed, Trust Structured securities as per notification of Ministry of Finance.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an  increase in the return on the plan’s investments.
216 Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the  mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the  plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
No other post - retirement benefits are provided to these employees.

Sensitivity due to mortality & withdrawals are not material & hence impact of change not calculated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated  using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the  defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

57 Finance Lease Obligation 417.96 417.96 45.3 Financial risk management objectives  While ensuring liquidity is sufficient to meet Company’s operational requirements, the Company’s financial management  committee also monitors and manages key financial risks relating to the operations of the Company by analyzing exposures by  degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk (including currency risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
45.4 Market Risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a  business.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The primary commodity price risks that the Company is exposed to include international crude oil prices that could adversely affect  the value of the Company’s financial assets or expected future cash flows.
Substantial or extended decline in international prices of  crude oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on the Company’s reported results.
45.5 Foreign currency risk management Sale price of crude oil is denominated in United States dollar (USD) though billed and received in Indian Rupees (INR).
The Company  is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency risk principally out of INR appreciating against USD.
Foreign currency risks on account of  receipts / revenue and payments / expenses are managed by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures through export earnings,  wherever possible and carry unhedged exposures for the residual considering the natural hedge available to it from domestic sales.
Standalone Financial Statements 237 The Company undertakes transactions denominated in different foreign currencies and consequently exposed to exchange rate  fluctuations.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s  foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows.
(` in million) Particulars Liabilities as at Assets as at As at March   31, 2018 As at March   31, 2017 As at 31   March, 2018 As at 31   March, 2017 USD 177, 218.

30 - - 45.5.1 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Company is principally exposed to foreign currency risk against USD.
Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly from  USD denominated receivables and payables.
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of +/- 5% between USD-INR  currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items at the period  end is presented below:   (` in million) USD sensitivity at year end Year ended   March 31, 2018 Year ended   March 31, 2017 Assets: Weakening of INR by 5% 1,346.81 603.80 Strengthening of INR by 5% (1, 3 4 6 .

45.5.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts The Company has not entered into any forward foreign exchange contracts during the reporting period.
45.6 Interest rate risk management The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the Company has borrowed funds benchmarked to overnight  MCLR, T reasury Bills and USD LIBOR.
The Company’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial  liabilities are detailed in note no.
27.2.
238 45.7 Price risks The Company’s equity securities price risk arises from investments held and classified in the balance sheet either at  fair value through OCI or at fair value through profit or loss.
The Company’s equity investments in IOC and GAIL are  publicly traded.
Investment of short-term surplus funds of the Company in liquid schemes of mutual funds provides high level of liquidity  from a portfolio of money market securities and high quality debt and categorized as ‘low risk’ product from liquidity and  interest rate risk perspectives.
45.7.1 Price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of profit or loss in respect of investments in equity shares and mutual funds at the end of the reporting  period for +/-5% change in price and net asset value is presented below: • Other comprehensive income for the year ended March 31, 2018 would increase/ decrease by `13,596.66 million  (for the year ended March 31, 2017 would increase/ decrease by  `14,478.68 million) as a result of 5% changes in  fair value of equity investments measured at FVTOCI; and • As there was no investment in mutual funds as on 31 st March, 2018, changes in net asset value of investment are  not applicable for the year ended March 31, 2018 (For the year ended March 31, 2017 would increase/decrease by   `1,817.16 million as a result of 5%  changes in net asset value of investment in mutual funds).

2 8 (+/-) 5 0 , 010 .7 2 45.8 Interest rate risk management The Company invests the surplus fund generated from operations in term deposits with banks and mutual funds.
Bank  deposits are made for a period of upto 12 months carry interest rate as per prevailing market interest rate.
Considering  these bank deposits are short term in nature, there is no significant interest rate risk.
Average interest earned on term  deposit and a mutual fund for the year ended March 31, 2018 was 6.16%.
45.9 Credit risk management Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments carried at amortized cost and deposits with banks as well as  customers including receivables.
Credit risk management considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking  information including indicators like external credit rating (as far as available), macro-economic information (such as  regulatory changes, government directives, market interest rate).
Major customers, being public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) and gas companies having highest credit ratings,  carry negligible credit risk.
Concentration of credit risk to any other counterparty did not exceed 4.17% (previous year  3.19%) of total monetary assets at any time during the year.
Credit exposure is managed by counterparty limits for investment of surplus funds which is reviewed by the Management.
Investments in liquid plan/schemes are with public sector Asset Management Companies having highest rating.
For  banks, only high rated banks are considered for placement of deposits.
Bank balances are held with reputed and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Company is exposed to default risk in relation to financial guarantees given to banks / vendors on behalf of subsidiaries  / joint venture companies for the estimated amount that would be payable to the third party for assuming the obligation.
The Company’s maximum exposure in this regard on as at March 31, 2018 is `441,956.86 million (As at March 31, 2017 is   `443,308.48 million).

Disclosure under Indian Accounting     Standard 36  – Impairment of Assets  47.1 The Company is engaged mainly in the business  of oil and gas exploration and production in  On-shore and Offshore.
In case of onshore  assets, the fields are using common production/ transportation facilities and are sufficiently  economically interdependent to constitute a  single cash generating unit (CGU).
Accordingly,  impairment test of all onshore fields is performed  in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field is generally  considered as CGU except for fields which  are developed as a Cluster, for which common  facilities are used, in which case the impairment  testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields  included in the cluster.
47.2 The Value in Use of producing/developing CGUs  is determined under a multi-stage approach,  wherein future cash flows are initially estimated  based on Proved Developed Reserves.
Under  the circumstances where further development  of the fields in the CGUs is under progress and  where the carrying value of the CGUs is not  likely to be recovered through exploitation of  proved developed reserves alone, the Proved  and probable reserves (2P) of the CGUs are  also taken for the purpose of estimating future  cash flows.
In such cases, full estimate of the  expected cost of evaluation/development is also  considered while determining the value in use.
47.3 In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows from the continuing use of assets and  from its disposal at the end of its useful life are  discounted to their present value.
The present  value of cash flows has been determined by  applying discount rates of 14.48% (as at March  31, 2017 - 14.88 %) for Rupee transactions and  9.68% (as at March 31, 2017- 10.57 %) for crude  oil and value added products revenue, which are  measured in USD.
Future cash inflows from sale  246 of crude oil and value added products have been  computed using the future prices, on the basis  of market-based average prices of dated Brent  crude oil as per ‘Platt’s Crude oil market wire’  and its Co-relations with benchmark crude and  other petroleum products.
Future cash flows  from sale of natural gas are also computed based  on the expected future prices on the basis of  notification issued by the Government of India  and discounted applying the rate applicable  to the cash flows measured in USD in view of   the new pricing guidelines issued by GOI.
(Note no.

The Company’s pending litigations comprise claims  against the Company and proceedings pending with  T ax / Statutory/ Government Authorities.
The  Company has reviewed all its pending litigations  and proceedings and has made adequate provisions,  wherever required and disclosed the contingent  liabilities, wherever applicable, in its financial  statements.
The Company does not expect the  outcome of these proceedings to have a material  impact on its financial position.
Future cash  outflows in respect of the above are determinable  only on receipt of judgments/ decisions pending  with various forums/ authorities.
b.
During the year, the Company has received show  cause notices at various work centers on account  of service tax along with interest and penalty, on  royalty on Crude oil and Natural gas levied under  Oil Field (Regulation & Development) Act, 1948.
The Company has worked out service tax (including  interest) of  `19,834.29 million for the period from  April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.
Further, the Company  has worked out GST (including interest) of   `14,315.98 million for the period from July 1, 2017  to March 31, 2018.
Penalty in respect of the same  is not quantifiable.
Based on legal opinion obtained  by the Company, service tax / GST on royalty are  not applicable.
The Company is contesting the same  at appropriate authorities and accordingly the same  has been shown as contingent liability.
However, as  an abundant caution, the company has deposited  Service tax, GST and interest under protest in May,  2018 amounting to `25,153.29 million.
c. The Company, with 40% Participating Interest (PI),  is a Joint Operator in Panna-Mukta and Mid and  South T apti Fields along with Reliance Industries  Limited (RIL) and BG Exploration and Production  India Limited (BGEPIL), each having 30% PI.
The Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) with  respect to Panna-Mukta and Mid and South T apti  contract areas were signed between the Contractors  and Government of India on December 22, 1994  for a period of 25 years.
In December 2010, RIL  & BGEPIL invoked an arbitration proceeding  against the Union of India in respect of certain  disputes, differences and claims arising out of or  in connection with both the PSCs in respect to  Panna-Mukta and Mid and South T apti contract  areas pursuant to the provisions of Article 33 of the  PSCs and UNCITRAL Rules, 1976.
The Ministry  of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG), vide  letter dated July 4, 2011, had advised the Company  not to participate in the arbitration initiated by RIL  and BGEPIL under Panna-Mukta & T apti PSCs.
However, in case of an arbitral award, the same will  be applicable to the Company also as a constituent  of the contractor for both the PSCs.
On October 12,  248 2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced  by the T ribunal in the arbitration matter between  RIL, BGEPIL and Union of India.
However, details  of proceedings in this regard are not known to the  Company since the Company is not a party to this  arbitration.
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons  (DGH), vide letter dated May 25, 2017 marked to  all Joint Venture Partners (RIL, BGEPIL & ONGC)  has asked for payment of  differential GOI share of  Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be payable by  contractor pursuant to Governments interpretation  of the FPA  (40% share of the Company  amounting  to US$ 1,574.76 million equivalent to  `102,233.41  million including interest up to November 30, 2016  ).
However, in response to letter dated May 25, 2017  of DGH, RIL and BGEPIL the JV partners (with a  copy marked to all the Joint Venture partners) have  stated that demand of DGH is premature as the FPA  does not make any money award in favour of GOI  as quantification of liabilities are to be determined  during the final proceedings of the arbitration and  the same has been challenged before the English  Commercial Court.
Further, subsequent to London High Court Orders  dated April 16, 2018 and May 2, 2018, DGH vide  letter dated May 4, 2018 and May 15, 2018 has asked  for re-casting of accounts of the JV and for remitting  respective PI share of balance dues including interest  till the date of remittance.
Details of proceedings  thereof and the London High Court orders are not  known to the Company since the Company is not  a party to the arbitration.
In response to the letter  of DGH RIL & BGEPIL have responded (with a  copy marked to all the Joint Venture partners) that  FPA of October 2016 does not make any money  award in favour of the Government.
Further it has  also been stated by RIL & BGEPIL that the English  Court has upheld challenge 4 of the claimants (RIL  & BGEPIL) in relation to “ Agreement Case” and  held that there had been a serious irregularity in the  Award of the T ribunal.
Further in the court order  of May 2, 2018, the English Court has directed the  T ribunal to re-consider the “ Agreement Case” and  issue a fresh award within three months of that date.
The “ Agreement Case” is closely linked with the  Cost recovery limit (CRL) increase application filed  by the contractor with the Management Committee  and T ribunals re-consideration of this issue  necessarily impacts the re-computation of accounts.
Re-computation of accounts and consequential  determination of any amount due and payable by  the contractor (Constituents of the JV including the  Company) are to be determined during the final stage  of the arbitration proceedings after determination of  all substantive issues by the T ribunal (including any  application for an increase in the T apti and Panna  Mukta CRL and an award on the Agreement Case).
The Company has also responded to DGH that as of  now, neither the Arbitral T ribunal nor the Court has  passed any order or quantified any amount due and  payable by the Company.
In the circumstances, the  demand of DGH from the Company for any sum or  interest thereon is premature and not justified.
The  company has requested DGH to keep the issue in  abeyance till finality in the award is achieved.
Pending the final quantification of liabilities by the  Arbitration T ribunal, no provision for the same has  been considered necessary.
However, the same has  been considered as contingent liability 48.1.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from  past events and whose existence will be confirmed only  by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more  uncertain future events not wholly within the control  of the entity.
During the normal course of business,  several unresolved claims are currently outstanding.
The inflow of economic benefits, in respect of such  claims cannot be measured due to uncertainties that  surround the related events and circumstances.

Report on the Consolidated Ind AS Financial  Statements  We have audited the accompanying consolidated  Ind AS financial statements of Oil and Natural Gas  Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as  “the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (the  Holding Company and its subsidiaries together  referred to as “the Group”), associates and joint  ventures, which comprise the consolidated Balance  Sheet as at 31st March 2018, the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other  Comprehensive Income), the consolidated  Statement of Cash Flows and the consolidated  Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then  ended and a summary of the significant accounting  policies and other explanatory information.
2.
Management’s Responsibility for the  Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements  The Holding Company’s Board of Directors  is responsible for the preparation of these  consolidated Ind AS financial statements in terms  of the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013  (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) that give a  true and fair view of the consolidated financial  position, consolidated profit, consolidated other  comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows  and consolidated changes in equity of the Group  including its associates and joint ventures in  accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies  included in the Group, its associates and joint  ventures are responsible for maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with  the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets  of the Group, its associates and joint ventures  and for preventing and detecting frauds and  other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls, that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the Ind AS  financial statements that give a true and fair view  and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, which have been used for the  purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS  financial statements by the Board of Directors of the  Holding Company, as aforesaid.
3.
Auditors’ Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated Ind AS financial statements based  on our audit.
While conducting the audit, we have  taken into account the provisions of the Act, the  accounting and auditing standards and matters  which are required to be included in the audit report  under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made  there under.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing specified under Section  143(10) of the Act.
Those Standards require that  we comply with ethical requirements and plan and  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the consolidated Ind AS financial  statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to  obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the  disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial  statements.
The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the  risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or  error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor  considers internal financial control relevant to the  Holding Company’s preparation of the consolidated  Ind AS financial statements that give a true and  fair view in order to design audit procedures that  are appropriate in the circumstances.
An audit  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the  accounting policies used and the reasonableness  260 of the accounting estimates made by the Holding  Company’s Board of Directors, as well as evaluating  the overall presentation of the consolidated Ind AS  financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us  and the audit evidence obtained by other auditors  in terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph  6(v) of the Other Matters paragraph below, is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial  statements.
4.
Opinion  In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based  on the consideration of reports of other auditors  on separate financial statements and on the other  financial information of the subsidiaries, associates  and joint ventures, the aforesaid consolidated Ind AS  financial statements give the information required  by the Act in the manner so required and give a true  and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India including  the Ind AS, of the consolidated financial position  of the Group, its associates and joint ventures  as at 31st March 2018 and their consolidated  profit, consolidated other comprehensive income,  consolidated cash flows and the consolidated  changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
5.
Emphasis of Matter  We draw attention to Note 55.1.3 of the  consolidated Ind AS financial statements, wherein it  is stated that during the year, Directorate General of  Hydrocarbons (DGH) has raised a demand on all  the JV partners of Panna-Mukta and Mid and South  T apti Fields JV (PMT), being BG Exploration and  Production India Limited (BGEPIL) and Reliance  Industries Limited (RIL) (together “the Claimants”)  and the Holding Company and the differential GOI  share of Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be  payable by contractor pursuant to Government’s  interpretation of the Final Partial Award (40%  share of the Holding Company amounting to  US$ 1,574.76 millions equivalent to `102,233.41  millions including interest upto November 30,  2016).
Subsequent to London High Court Orders  dated April 16, 2018 and May 2, 2018, DGH vide  letter dated May 4, 2018 and May 15, 2018 has  asked for re-casting of accounts of the PMT JV and  for remitting the respective PI share of balance dues  including interest till the date of remittance.
As the  Holding Company is not a party to the arbitration,  the details of the proceedings of arbitration and  copy of order of London High Court are not  available with the Holding Company.
The Holding  Company has responded that as of now, neither  the Arbitral T ribunal nor the London High Court  has passed any order or quantified any amount  due and payable by the Holding Company and in  the circumstances, the demand of DGH from the  Holding Company for any sum or interest thereon  is premature and not justified.
In the Holding  Company’s view, pending final quantification of  liabilities by the Arbitration T ribunal, it is not liable  to implement the Final Partial Award (FPA) being  pre-mature and therefore no provision for the same  has been considered necessary and the same has  been considered as contingent liability.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
6.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan  and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal financial controls over  financial reporting was established and maintained and if  such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and their  operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial  controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on  the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the  risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms  of the reports referred to in the “Other Matters” paragraph  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial  controls system over financial reporting.Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of consolidated Ind AS financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s  internal financial control over financial reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain  to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of consolidated Ind AS  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the company are being made only in accordance  with authorizations of management and directors of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  268 acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets  that could have a material effect on the consolidated Ind  AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Con- trols over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and  not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the  internal financial controls over financial reporting to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  control over financial reporting may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary  companies, associates and joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, have, in all material  respects, an adequate internal financial controls system  over financial reporting and such internal financial  controls over financial reporting were operating effectively  as at 31st March 2018, based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3) of the Act on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial controls over financial reporting in so far as it  relates to four subsidiary companies, an associate and four  joint ventures which are companies incorporated in India,  is based on the corresponding standalone / consolidated  reports of the auditors, as applicable, of such companies  incorporated in India.
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3) of the Act on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal  financial controls over financial reporting does not  include in respect of one associate and one joint venture,  which are companies incorporated in India whose audit  reports are not available.
In our opinion and according  to information and explanations given to us by the  Management, these financial information are not material  to the Group.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

The Company’s shares are listed and traded  on Stock Exchanges in India.
The Consolidated  Financial Statements relate to the Company, its  Subsidiaries, Joint Venture Entities and Associates.
The Group (comprising of the Company and its  subsidiaries), Joint Venture Entities and Associates  are mainly engaged in exploration, development  and production of crude oil, natural gas and value  added products in India and acquisition of oil  and Gas acreages outside India for exploration,  development and production, downstream  (Refining and marketing of petroleum products),  Petrochemicals, Power Generation, LNG supply,  Pipeline T ransportation, SEZ development and  Helicopter services.
Acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum  Corporation Limited  The Company on 31 st January 2018 has acquired  51.11% shareholding held by the President of  India (778,845,375 equity shares of face value ` 10  per share) in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation  Limited (HPCL), at `  473.97 per share for a  total cash consideration of `  369,150.00 million.
The difference between the consideration paid  (` 369,150.00 million) and the value of 51.11% stake  in net identifiable assets of HPCL (` 138,777.86  million) on the date of acquisition (i.e.

Pursuant to acquisition of HPCL, Petronet MHB  Limited has been reclassified from a joint venture  to a subsidiary as the Company holds 32.72%  ownership interest and its subsidiary HPCL holds  32.72% ownership interest.
The acquisition has been evaluated as a business  combination under common control and has been  accounted based on pooling of interest method as  stated at note 3.4.
In compliance with Appendix C  of Ind AS 103 ‘Business Combination’ read with  Ind AS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ ,  the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31,  2017, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity  for the year ended 31st March 2017, Consolidated  Statement of Profit and loss for the year ended  31st March 2017, Consolidated Statement of Cash  Flows for the year ended 31st March 2017 have been  restated.
2.
Application of new Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS)  All the Indian Accounting Standards issued under  section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and notified  by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) till the financial  statements are authorized have been considered in  preparation of these Financial Statements.
2.1 Standards issued but not yet effective   The MCA has notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards/ Ind AS) Amendment  Rules, 2018 on 28 March 2018, whereby  “Ind  AS-115 relating to Revenue from Contracts with  Customers” and Appendix B to Ind AS 21 relating  to Foreign Currency T ransactions and advance  considerations” has been made applicable from  financial year 2018-19 (i.e.
1 April, 2018 onwards).
Ind AS-115 relating to Revenue from Contracts  with Customers:  The Standard replaces the existing Ind AS 18 on  “Revenue” and Ind AS 11 Construction Contracts.
Ind AS 115 establishes the principles that an entity  shall apply to report useful information to users  of financial statements about the nature, amount,  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows  arising from a contract with a customer.
Ind AS 21 – Appendix B - Foreign currency  transactions and advance consideration:  This Appendix applies to a foreign currency  transaction (or part of it) when an entity recognises  a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability  arising from the payment or receipt of advance  consideration before the entity recognises the  related asset, expense or income (or part of it).
Consolidated Financial Statements 279  Ind AS 40 - T ransfers of Investment Property – The  amendments clarify when an entity should transfer  property, including property under construction or  development into, or out of investment property.
The amendments state that a change in use occurs  when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the  definition of investment property and there is  evidence of the change in use.
A mere change in  management’s intentions for the use of a property  does not provide evidence of a change in use.
Entities should apply the amendments prospectively  to changes in use that occur on or after the  beginning of the annual reporting period in which  the entity first applies the amendments.
An entity  should reassess the classification of property held  at that date and, if applicable, reclassify property  to reflect the conditions that exist at that date.
Retrospective application in accordance with Ind  AS 8 is only permitted if it is possible without the  use of hindsight.
The Group is evaluating the requirements of the  amendments and its effect on the Consolidated  Financial Statements.
3.
Significant Group Accounting Policies 3.1 Statement of compliance  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared in accordance with Ind AS notified under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) and Guidance Note on  Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities  (Ind AS) issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
3.2 Basis of preparation  During the year, the Company has acquired  51.11% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation  Limited (‘HPCL’) from Government of India.
The acquisition transaction has been evaluated as  a business combination under common control  (Refer note 4).
Accordingly, in compliance with  Appendix C of Ind AS 103 ‘Business Combination’  read with Ind AS 1 ‘Presentation of financial  statements’ , the consolidated financial statements  have been restated as if business combination has  occurred from the beginning of the preceding  period (i.e.
April 1, 2016).
Refer note 26.5 on  business combination.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared on the historical cost basis except for  certain assets and liabilities which are measured at  fair value/amortised cost/Net present value at the  end of each reporting period, as explained in the  accounting policies below:  Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and  services.
As the operating cycle cannot be identified in  normal course due to the special nature of industry,  the same has been assumed to have duration of 12  months.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities have  been classified as current or non-current as per the  operating cycle and other criteria set out in Ind AS-1  ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and Schedule  III to the Companies Act, 2013.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are  presented in Indian Rupees and all values are  rounded off to the nearest two decimal million  except otherwise stated.
Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date under current market conditions.
The Group categorizes assets and liabilities measured  at fair value into one of the three levels depending  on the ability to observe inputs employed in their  measurement which are described as follows:  • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable,  either directly or indirectly, other than quoted  prices included within level 1 for the assets or  liabilities.
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for  the asset or liability reflecting significant  modifications to observable related market data  or Group’s assumptions about pricing by market  participants.
3.3 Principles of Consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate  the financial statements of the Company and its  280 subsidiaries (collectively referred as “the Group”).
The Group has investments in associates and joint  ventures which are accounted using equity method  in these consolidated financial statements.
Refer  note 3.7 for the accounting policy of investment in  associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated  Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
The Company controls an entity when it is exposed,  or has rights to variable returns from its involvement  with the entity and has the ability to affect those  returns through its power to direct the relevant  activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are consolidated  from the date of their acquisition (except for  Business Combinations under Common Control),  being the date on which the Company obtains  control and continue to be consolidated until the  date that such control ceases.
The Consolidated financial statements are prepared  using uniform accounting policies consistently  for like transactions and other events in similar  circumstances and are presented to the extent  possible, in the same manner as the Company’s  Standalone Financial Statements except otherwise  stated.
When necessary, adjustments are made to  the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring  their accounting policies in line with the Group’s  Significant Accounting Policies.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared by combining the financial statements of   the company and its subsidiaries on a line-by-line  basis by adding together the book values of like items  of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and  cash flow after eliminating in full intra-group assets,  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flow  relating to intra-group transactions and unrealized  profits.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless  the transaction provides evidence of an impairment  of the asset transferred.
Such unrealized profits/ losses are fully attributed to the Company.
Profit or loss and each component of other  comprehensive income are attributed to the owners  of the Company and to the non-controlling interests.
T otal comprehensive income is attributed to the  owners of the Company and to the non-controlling  interests even if this results in the non-controlling  interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in  subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as  equity transactions.
The carrying amounts of the  Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests  are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries.
Any difference between  the amount by which the non-controlling interests  are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration  paid or received is recognised directly in equity and  attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain  or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss and is calculated as the difference  between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the  consideration received and the fair value of any  retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying  amount of the assets (including goodwill) and  liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling  interests.
All amounts previously recognised in  other comprehensive income in relation to that  subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had  directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of  the subsidiary (i.e.
reclassified to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss or transferred to another  category of equity as specified/permitted by  applicable Ind AS).
The fair value of any investment  retained in the former subsidiary at the date when  control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial  recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind AS  109, or the cost on initial recognition as investment  in an associate or a joint venture, when applicable.
3.4 Business Combination  Acquisitions of businesses (except for Business  Combinations under Common Control) are  accounted for using the acquisition method.
The  consideration transferred in a business combination  is measured at fair value which is calculated as the  sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets  transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the  Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the  equity interests issued by the Group in exchange of  control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs are  generally recognised in consolidated statement of  profit and loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised  at their fair value, except that: Consolidated Financial Statements 281  - Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets  or liabilities related to employee benefit  arrangements are recognised and measured in  accordance with Ind AS 12 ‘Income T axes’ and  Ind AS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ respectively;  - Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as  held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 ‘Non- current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations’ are measured in accordance with  that Standard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of  the consideration transferred, the amount of any  non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the  fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity  interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the  acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed.
In case of a bargain purchase, before recognising  a gain in respect thereof, the Group determines  whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying  reasons for classifying the business combination as  a bargain purchase.
Thereafter, the Group reassesses  whether it has correctly identified all of the assets  acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and  recognises any additional assets or liabilities that  are identified in that reassessment.
The Group then  reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts  that Ind AS requires for the purposes of calculating  the bargain purchase.
If the gain remains after this  reassessment and review, the Group recognises it  in other comprehensive income and accumulates  the same in equity as capital reserve.
This gain is  attributed to the acquirer.
If there does not exist clear  evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the  business combination as a bargain purchase, the Group  recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing (as  described above), directly in equity as capital reserve.
When the consideration transferred by the Group  in a business combination includes assets or  liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration  arrangement, the contingent consideration is  measured at its acquisition date fair value and  included as part of the consideration transferred  in a business combination.
Changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration that qualify  as measurement period adjustments are adjusted  retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments  against goodwill or capital reserve, as the case  may be.
Measurement period adjustments are  adjustments that arise from additional information  obtained by the Group during the ‘measurement  period’ about facts and circumstances that existed at  the acquisition date.
Measurement period does not  exceed one year from the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration that do not  qualify as measurement period adjustments depends  on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity  is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and  its subsequent settlement is accounted for within  equity.
Contingent consideration that is classified as  an asset or a liability is remeasured at fair value at  subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding  gain or loss being recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.
When a business combination is achieved in stages,  the Group’s previously held equity interest in  the acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition date  fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the  acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have  previously been recognised in other comprehensive  income are reclassified to the consolidated statement  of profit and loss where such treatment would be  appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination  is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in  which the combination occurs, the Group reports  provisional amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional  amounts are adjusted during the measurement  period recognising additional assets or liabilities (if  any) to reflect new information obtained about facts  and circumstances that existed at the acquisition  date that, if known, would have affected the amounts  recognised at that date.
Business Combination under Common control   A business combination involving entities or  businesses under common control is a business  combination in which all of the combining entities  or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same  party or parties both before and after the business  combination and the control is not transitory.
282 The transactions between entities under common  control are specifically covered by Appendix C to  Ind AS 103 and are accounted for using the pooling- of-interest method as follows: • The assets and liabilities of the combining  entities are reflected at the carrying amounts.
• No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or  recognize new assets or liabilities.
Adjustments  are made to harmonize significant accounting  policies.
• The financial information in the financial  statements in respect of prior periods is restated  as if the business combination has occurred  from the beginning of the preceding period  in the financial statements, irrespective of the  actual date of the combination.
The balance of the retained earnings appearing in the  financial statements of the transferor is aggregated  with the corresponding balance appearing in the  financial statements of the transferee.
The identity  of the reserves are preserved and the reserves of the  transferor become the reserves of the transferee.
The difference, if any, between the amounts  recorded as share capital issued plus any additional  consideration in the form of cash or other assets  and the amount of share capital of the transferor  is transferred to capital reserve and is presented  separately from other capital reserves.
3.5 Non-controlling interests  Non-controlling interests represent the proportion  of income, other comprehensive income and net  assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the  Company’s shareholders.
Non-controlling interests are initially measured at  the proportionate share of the recognised amounts  of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Subsequent  to acquisition, the carrying amount of non- controlling interests is the amount of the interest at  initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’  share of subsequent changes in equity.
3.6 Goodwill on consolidation  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is  carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition  of the business less accumulated impairment losses,  if any.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill  is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating  units (or groups of cash-generating units) that  is expected to benefit from the synergies of the  combination.
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more  frequently when there is an indication that the cash  generating unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable  amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its  carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated  first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill  allocated to the cash generating unit and then to  the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the  carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any  impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly  in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
An  impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not  reversed in subsequent periods.
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the  attributable amount of goodwill is included in the  determination of the Profit and Loss.
3.7 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures  An Associate is an entity over which the Group has  significant influence.
Significant influence is the  power to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control or  joint control over those policies.
A Joint Venture is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing  of control of an arrangement, which exists only  when decisions about the relevant activities require  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates or  joint ventures are incorporated in the Consolidated  Financial Statements using the equity method  of accounting, except when the investment, or  a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in  which case it is accounted for in accordance with  Ind AS 105 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale  and Discontinued Operations’ .
Under the equity  method, an investment in an associate or a joint  venture is initially recognised in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to  recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and  Consolidated Financial Statements 283 other comprehensive income of the associate  or joint venture.
Distributions received from an  associate or a joint venture reduces the carrying  amount of investment.
When the Group’s share of  losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the  Group’s interest in that associate or joint venture  (which includes any long term interests that, in  substance, form part of the Group’s net investment  in the associate or joint venture), the Group  discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.
Additional losses are recognized only to the extent  that the Group has legal or constructive obligations  or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint  venture.
Loans advanced to Associate & Joint Venture and  that have the characteristics of financing through  equity are also included in the investment of the  Group’s consolidated balance sheet.
The Group’s  share of amounts recognized directly in equity  by Associate & Joint Venture is recognized in the  Group’s consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the group  and its Associate & Joint Venture are eliminated to  the extent of the Group’s interest in Associate & Joint  Venture.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated to the  extent of Group’s interest unless the transaction  provides evidence of an impairment of the asset  transferred.
If an associate or a joint venture uses accounting  policies other than those of the Group accounting  policies for like transactions and events in similar  circumstances, adjustments are made to make the  associate’s or joint venture’s financial statements  confirm to the Group’s significant accounting  policies before applying the equity method, unless,  in case of an associate where it is impracticable do so.
An investment in an Associate or a Joint Venture  is accounted for using the equity method from the  date on which the investee becomes an Associate or  a Joint Venture.
On acquisition of the investment  in an Associate or a Joint Venture, any excess of  the cost of the investment over the Group’s share  of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and  liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill,  which is included within the carrying amount of the  investment.
Any excess of the Group’s share of the  net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  over the cost of the investment, after reassessment,  is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in  the period in which the investment is acquired.
After application of the equity method of  accounting, the Group determines whether there  is any objective evidence of impairment as a result  of one or more events that occurred after the initial  recognition of the net investment in an associate  or a joint venture and that event (or events) has an  impact on the estimated future cash flows from the  net investment that can be reliably estimated.
If there  exists such an objective evidence of impairment,  then Group recognises impairment loss with  respect to the Group’s investment in an associate or  a joint venture.
When necessary, the entire carrying  amount of the investment (including goodwill)  is tested for impairment in accordance with Ind  AS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ as a single asset by  comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value  in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its  carrying amount, Any impairment loss recognised  forms part of the carrying amount of the investment.
Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in  accordance with Ind AS 36 to the extent that the  recoverable amount of the investment subsequently  increases.
The Group discontinues the use of the equity  method from the date when the investment ceases  to be an associate or a joint venture, or when the  investment is classified as held for sale.
When the  Group retains an interest in the former associate  or joint venture and the retained interest is a  financial asset, the Group measures the retained  interest at fair value at that date and the fair value  is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in  accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ .
The difference between the carrying amount of  the associate or joint venture at the date the equity  method was discontinued, and the fair value of any  retained interest and any proceeds from disposing  of a part interest in the associate or joint venture  is included in the determination of the gain or  loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive  income in relation to that associate or joint venture  on the same basis as would be required if that  associate or joint venture had directly disposed of  284 the related assets or liabilities.
Therefore, if a gain or  loss previously recognised in other comprehensive  income by that associate or joint venture would  be reclassified to the consolidated statement of  profit and loss on the disposal of the related assets  or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss  from equity to the consolidated statement of profit  and loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the  equity method is discontinued.
The Group continues to use the equity method  when an investment in an associate becomes an  investment in a joint venture or an investment in a  joint venture becomes an investment in an associate.
There is no remeasurement to fair value upon such  changes in ownership interests.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest  in an associate or a joint venture but the Group  continues to use the equity method, the Group  reclassifies to the consolidated statement of profit  and loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had  previously been recognised in other comprehensive  income relating to that reduction in ownership  interest as if that gain or loss would be reclassified to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the  disposal of the related assets or liabilities.
When a group entity transacts with an associate  or a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses  resulting from the transactions with the associate  or joint venture are recognised in the Group’s  consolidated financial statements only to the extent  of interests in the associate or joint venture that are  not related to the Group.
3.8 Interests in joint operations  A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the assets, and obligations for the  liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
Joint control  is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an  arrangement, which exists only when decisions  about the relevant activities require unanimous  consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group has Joint Operations in the nature of  Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the  Government of India/other countries and various  body corporates for exploration, development and  production activities.
The Group’s share in the assets and liabilities along  with attributable income and expenditure of the  Joint Operations is merged on line by line basis  with the similar items in the Consolidated Financial  Statements and adjusted for leases, depreciation,  overlift/ underlift, depletion, survey, dry wells,  decommissioning provision, impairment and  sidetracking in accordance with the accounting  policies of the Group.
The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are taken in  proportion to the participating interest of the Group.
Gain or loss on sale of interest in a joint operation,  is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss, except that no gain is recognized  at the time of such sale if substantial uncertainty  exists about the recovery of the costs applicable to  the retained interest or if the Group has substantial  obligation for future performance.
The gain in  such situation is treated as recovery of cost related  to that block.
3.9 Non-current assets held for sale  Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified  as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be  recovered principally through a sale transaction  rather than through continuing use.
This condition  is regarded as met only when the sale is highly  probable and the asset or disposal group is available  for immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for sales  of such assets.
Management must be committed to  the sale, which should be expected to qualify for  recognition as a completed sale within one year from  the date of classification as held for sale, and actions  required to complete the plan of sale should indicate  that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan  will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and  intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized  once classified as held for sale.
3.10 Government Grant  Government grants, including non-monetary  grants at fair value, are not recognised until there  is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply  Consolidated Financial Statements 285 with the conditions attached to them and that the  grants will be received.
Government grants are recognised in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis  over the periods in which the Group recognises as  expenses the related costs for which the grants are  intended to compensate.
Government grants whose primary condition  is that the Group should purchase, construct or  otherwise acquire non-current assets and non- monetary grants are recognised and disclosed as  ‘deferred income’ under non-current liability in  the Consolidated Balance Sheet and transferred to  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a  systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of  the related assets.
The benefit of a government loan at a rate below the  market rate of interest is treated as a government  grant, and is measured as the difference between  proceeds received and the fair value of the loan  based on prevailing market interest rates.
3.11 Property Plant and Equipment (other than  Oil and Gas Assets)  The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where  due to change in functional currency, this exemption  is not available as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101) has  elected to continue with the carrying value of all of  its Property Plant and Equipment  recognised as  of April 1, 2015 (transition date) measured as per  the Previous GAAP and use that carrying value  as its deemed cost as of the transition date except  adjustment related to  decommissioning liabilities.
Land and buildings held for use in the production  or supply of goods or services, or for administrative  purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if  any.
Freehold land and land under perpetual lease  are not depreciated.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the  course of construction for production, supply or  administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any  recognised impairment loss.
The cost of an asset  comprises its purchase price or its construction  cost (net of applicable tax credits), any cost directly  attributable to bring the asset into the location and  condition necessary for it to be capable of operating  in the manner intended by the Management  and   decommissioning cost as per note 3.17.
It  includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets,  borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with  the Group’s accounting policy.
Such properties  are classified to the appropriate categories of PPE  when completed and ready for intended use.
Parts  of an item of PPE having different useful lives  and significant value and subsequent expenditure  on Property, Plant and Equipment arising on  account of capital improvement or other factors are  accounted for as separate components.
Expenditure  on dry docking of rigs and vessels are accounted for  as component of relevant assets.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed on an annual  basis and if necessary, changes in estimates are  accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE  arising on account of capital improvements or  other factors is provided for prospectively over the  remaining useful life.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated  over their expected useful lives on the same basis as  owned assets.
Depreciation on additions/deletions to PPE during  the year is provided for on a pro-rata basis with  reference to the date of additions/deletions except  low value items not exceeding `  5,000/- which  are fully depreciated at the time of addition of  Assets related to operations in India and items not  exceeding USD 100 which are fully depreciated at  the time of addition of Assets related to operations  outside India.
An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected to  arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or  loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item  of PPE is determined as the difference between the  sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  and is recognised in the consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.
Depreciation of these PPE commences when the  assets are ready for their intended use.
286  The Group account for their depreciation on  following basis:-  (a) Depreciation- PPE of Exploration &  Production (E&P) (other than freehold land,  Oil and Gas Assets and properties under  construction)   Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE of  E&P operations less their residual values, using  the written down value method (except for  components of dry docking capitalised) over the  useful life of PPE as stated in the Schedule II to  the Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  assessment by the Company.
Estimated useful  lives of these assets are as under: Description Useful life in years Building & Bunk Houses 3 to 60 Plant & Machinery 2 to 40 Furniture and Fixtures 3 to 15 Vehicles 5 to 20 Office Equipment 2 to 20   Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE  which are capitalized separately is provided  for over the reassessed useful life which is not  more than the life specified in Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013.
Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking  of rigs and vessels capitalized as component  of relevant rig / vessels is charged over the dry  dock period on straight line basis.
Depreciation on PPE including support  equipment and facilities used for exploratory/  development drilling is initially capitalised as  part of drilling cost and expensed/depleted as  per Note 3.15.
Depreciation on equipment/  assets deployed for survey activities is charged to  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
(b)  Depreciation- PPE of Refining & Marketing,   Crude oil T ransportation business (other  than freehold land and properties under  construction)   Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  less their residual values of asset associated  with Refinery, Petrochemical, Crude oil  T ransportation, using Straight Line Method,  over the useful life as specified in Schedule II  to the Companies Act, 2013, except in case of  certain components of the Plant and Equipment  whose useful lives are determined based on  technical evaluation.
Useful lives are as follows:-  Asset categories Useful life in years Buildings 1-60 Plant & Machinery 2-40 Furniture 3-10 Office equipment 3-15 Vehicles 4-8   In respect of refining & marketing business,  the useful life of following assets are based on  internal technical assessment: Asset categories Useful life in  years Plant and Machinery relating to  Retail Outlets (other than Storage  tanks and related equipment) 15 years Cavern Structure 60 years LPG cylinders & regulators 15 years   Expenditure on overhaul and repairs on account  of planned shutdown which are of significant  value (5% of the value of particular assets) is  capitalized as component of relevant items  of PPE and is depreciated over the period till  next shutdown on straight line basis.
Catalyst  whose life is more than one year is capitalised as  property, plant and equipment and depreciated  over the guaranteed useful life as specified by the  supplier when the catalyst is put to use.
3.12 Intangible Assets  (i) Intangible assets acquired separately  The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where  due to change in functional currency this exemption  is not available as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101)  has elected to continue with the carrying value of  all of its intangible assets recognised as of April 1,  2015 (transition date) measured as per the Previous  GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost  as of the transition date except adjustment related to   decommissioning liabilities.
Intangible assets are carried at cost net of  accumulated amortization and accumulated  Consolidated Financial Statements 287 impairment losses, if any.
Internally generated  intangibles, excluding development costs, are not  capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected  in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in  which the expenditure is incurred.
Development  costs are capitalised if technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future  economic benefits are probable, the Group has an  intention and ability to complete and use or sell the  asset and the costs can be measured reliably.
In cases where, the Group has constructed assets  and the Group has only a preferential right to use,  these assets are classified as intangible assets and  are amortised (after retaining the residual value, if  applicable) over their useful life or the period of the  agreement, whichever is lower.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are  acquired separately.
amortized on a straight-line  basis over their estimated useful life.
Intangible  assets in form of right to use is amortised on straight  line basis over the useful life of underlying asset.
The estimated useful life is reviewed at the end of  each reporting period and the effect of any changes  in estimate being accounted for prospectively and  tested for impairment.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are  acquired separately are not subject to amortisation  and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment  losses, if any.
An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or  when no future economic benefits are expected  from use or disposal.
Gains or losses arising from  derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as  the difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset, and recognised  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss,  when the asset is derecognised.
T echnical know-how / license fee relating to  production process and process design are  recognized as Intangible Assets.
Estimated lives of intangible assets (acquired) are as  follows:  • Software – 2 to 10 years  • T echnical know-how/license fees – 2 to 10 years  • Right to use-wind mills : 22 years (ii) Intangible assets under development -  Ex- ploratory Wells in Progress    All exploration and evaluation costs incurred in  drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal  wells, are initially capitalized as Intangible assets  under development - Exploratory Wells in Progress  till the time these are either transferred to Oil and  Gas Assets on completion as per note no.
3.15  or expensed as exploration and evaluation cost  (including allocated depreciation) as and when  determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case  may be.
Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test  wells are initially capitalized as Intangible assets  under development - Exploratory Wells in Progress  till the time these are either transferred to Oil and  Gas Assets as per note no.
3.15 or expensed as  exploration and evaluation cost (including allocated  depreciation) as when determined to be dry or  the petroleum exploration license/field/project is  surrendered.
Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over unless  it could be reasonably demonstrated that there are  indications of sufficient quantity of reserves and  sufficient progress has been made in assessing the  reserves and the economic and operating viability of  the project.
All such carried over costs are subject to  review for impairment as per the policy of the Group.
3.13 Impairment of tangible and intangible as- sets other than goodwill  The Group reviews the carrying amount of its  tangible and intangible assets (Oil and Gas Assets,  Development Wells in Progress (DWIP), and  Property, Plant and Equipment (including Capital  Works in Progress) of a “Cash Generating Unit”  (CGU) at the end of each reporting period to  determine whether there is any indication that those  assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such  indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset  is estimated in order to determine the extent of the  impairment loss (if any).
When it is not possible to  estimate the recoverable amount of an individual  asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of  the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such as  “Right of way” and intangible assets not yet available  288 for use are tested for impairment at least annually or  whenever there is an indication that the asset may be  impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs of disposal and value in use.
In assessing value  in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted  to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate  that reflects current market assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have not  been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its  carrying amount, the carrying amount of the  asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to  its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is  recognised immediately in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
An assessment is made at the end of each reporting  period to see if there are any indications that  impairment losses recognized earlier may no longer  exist or may have come down.
The impairment  loss is reversed, if there has been a change in the  estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable  amount since the previous impairment loss was  recognized.
If it is so, the carrying amount of the  asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable  amount and the carrying amount that have been  determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment  loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
After  a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in  future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying  amount, less any residual value, on a systematic  basis over its remaining useful life.
Reversals of  Impairment loss are recognized in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Exploration and Evaluation assets are tested for  Impairment when further exploration activities  are not planned in near future or when sufficient  data exists to indicate that although a development  is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the  exploration asset is unlikely to be recovered in full  from successful development or by sale.
Impairment  loss is reversed subsequently, to the extent that  conditions for impairment are no longer present.
3.14 Exploration & Evaluation, Development  and Production Costs   (i) Pre-acquisition cost   Expenditure incurred before obtaining the  right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil and  gas are expensed as and when incurred.
(ii) Acquisition cost   Acquisition costs of an Oil and Gas Asset are  costs related to right to acquire mineral interest  and are accounted as follows:-   Exploration and development stage   Acquisition cost relating to projects under  exploration or development are initially  accounted as Intangible Assets under  development - exploratory wells in progress  or Oil & Gas Assets under development -  development wells in progress respectively.
Such costs are capitalized by transferring to  Oil and Gas Assets when a well is ready to  commence commercial production.
In case of  abandonment / relinquishment of Intangible  Assets under development - exploratory wells  in progress, such costs are written off.
Production stage   Acquisition costs of a producing Oil and Gas  Assets are capitalized as proved property  acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets and  amortized using the unit of production method  over proved reserves of underlying assets.
(iii) Survey cost   Cost of Survey and prospecting activities  conducted in the search of oil and gas are  expensed as exploration cost in the year in which  these are incurred.
(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development -  Development Wells in Progress   All costs relating to Development Wells are  initially capitalized as ‘Development Wells in  Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas Assets’  on “completion” .
Consolidated Financial Statements 289  (v) Production costs   Production costs include pre-well head and post- well head expenses including depreciation and  applicable operating costs of support equipment  and facilities.
(vi) Impairment of Acquisition costs relating to  participating rights   For the purposes of impairment testing,  acquisition cost is allocated to each of the  Group’s CGUs (or groups of CGUs) that is  expected to benefit from the synergies of the  combination.
A CGU to which acquisition cost has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually  when there is an indication that the unit may be  impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit is less than its carrying amount,  the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce  the carrying amount of any acquisition cost  allocated to the unit and then to the other assets  of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount  of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss  recognised for acquisition cost is not reversed in  subsequent periods.
On disposal of the relevant CGU, the attributable  carrying amount of acquisition cost is included  in the determination of the profit or loss on  disposal.
3.15 Oil and Gas Assets  The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd where  due to change in functional currency this exemption  is not available  as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101)  has elected to continue with the carrying value of  all of its Oil and Gas assets recognised as of April 1,  2015 (transition date) measured as per the Previous  GAAP and use that carrying value as its deemed cost  as of the transition date except adjustment related to   decommissioning liabilities.
Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost less  accumulated depletion and impairment losses.
These  are created in respect of an area / field having proved  developed oil and gas reserves, when the well in the area  / field is ready to commence commercial production.
Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful  exploratory wells, all development wells (including  service wells), allied facilities, depreciation on  support equipment used for drilling and estimated  future decommissioning costs are capitalised and  classified as Oil and Gas Assets  Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit  of Production Method” .
The rate of depletion is  computed with reference to an area covered by  individual lease / license / asset /field /project  / amortization base by considering the proved  developed reserves and related capital costs incurred  including estimated future decommissioning /  abandonment costs net of salvage value.
Acquisition  cost of Oil and Gas Assets is depleted by considering  the proved reserves.
These reserves are estimated  annually by the Reserve Estimates Committee  of the Company, which follows the International  Reservoir Engineering Procedures.
3.16 Side tracking  In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side- tracking is treated in the same manner as the cost  incurred on a new exploratory well.
The cost of  abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory wells  is expensed as ‘Exploration cost written off.
’  In the case of development wells, the entire cost of  abandoned portion and side tracking is capitalized.
In the case of producing wells and service wells,  if the side-tracking results in additional proved  developed oil and gas reserves or increases the future  economic benefits therefrom beyond previously  assessed standard of performance, the cost incurred  on side tracking is capitalised, whereas the cost of  abandoned portion of the well is depleted in the  normal way.
Otherwise, the cost of side tracking is  expensed as ‘Work over Expenditure.
’ 3.17 Decommissioning costs  Decommissioning cost includes cost of restoration.
Provision for decommissioning costs are recognized  when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation  to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a  facility or an item of Property, Plant and Equipment  and to restore the site on which it is located.
The full  eventual estimated provision towards costs relating  to dismantling, abandoning and restoring well sites  and allied facilities are recognized in respective  assets when the well is complete / facilities or  Property, Plant and Equipment are installed.
290  The amount recognized is the present value of the  estimated future expenditure determined using  existing technology at current prices and escalated  using appropriate inflation rate till the expected date of  decommissioning and discounted up to the reporting  date using the appropriate risk free discount rate.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning  provision is recognized along with the cost of  exploratory well or Property, Plant and Equipment.
The decommissioning cost in respect of dry well is  expensed as exploratory well cost.
Any change in the present value of the estimated  decommissioning provision other than the  periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted to the  decommissioning provision and the corresponding  carrying value of the related asset.
In case reversal  of decommissioning provision exceeds the  corresponding carrying amount of the related asset,  the excess amount is recognized in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
The unwinding of  discount on provision is charged in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.
Provision for decommissioning cost in respect of  assets under Joint Operations is considered as per  participating interest of the Group on the basis  of estimate approved by the respective operating  committee.
Wherever the same are not approved by  the respective operating committee abandonment  cost estimates of the company are considered.
3.18 Inventories  (a) Raw material and Stock in Process –Refinery  & Petrochemicals   Raw material and Stock in Process is valued at  lower of cost or net realizable value.
Raw material  is valued based on First in First Out (FIFO) basis.
Cost of Stock in Process comprises of raw material  cost and proportionate Conversion cost.
Raw materials for lubricants are valued at  weighted average cost or at net realisable value,  whichever is lower.

Sulphur is valued at net realisable value.
The  value of inventories includes excise duty, royalty  (wherever applicable) but excludes Cess.
Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group  Gathering Stations (GGS) is valued at cost on  absorption costing method or net realisable  value whichever is lower.
Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines  up to GGS / platform is not valued as the same  is not measurable.
Natural Gas is not valued as it  is not stored.
(ii) Refining & Petrochemicals   Cost of finished goods (other than lubricants)  is determined based on raw material cost,  conversion cost and excise duty.

Customs duty on Raw materials/Finished goods  lying in bonded warehouse are provided for at  the applicable rates except where liability to pay  duty is transferred to consignee.
Excise duty on finished stocks lying at  manufacturing locations is provided for at  the assessable value applicable at each of the  locations based on applicable duty.
The net realizable value of finished goods and  stock in trade are final selling prices for sales  to oil marketing companies and depot prices  applicable to the locations.
For the purpose of  stock valuation, the proportion of sales of oil  marketing companies and consumer sales are  determined on location wise and product wise  sales of subsequent period.
Consolidated Financial Statements 291  (c) Store & Spares    Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued at  weighted average cost or net realisable value,  whichever is lower.
Wherever, weighted average  cost or net realisable value is not available, the  cost made available by the operator is considered  for valuation of Stores and Spares.
Provisions are  made for obsolete and non-moving inventories.
Unserviceable and scrap items, when  determined, are valued at estimated net  realisable value.
3.19 Revenue recognition   Revenue arising from sale of products is recognized  when the significant risks and rewards of ownership  have passed to the buyer, which is at the point of  transfer of custody to customers, and the amount of  revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable  that the economic benefits associated with the  transaction will flow to the Group.
Revenue from services is recognized when the  outcome of services can be estimated reliably and  it is probable that the economic benefits associated  with rendering of services will flow to the Group,  and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable and represents  amounts receivable for goods and services provided in  the normal course of business, net of discounts, GST  and sales tax / VAT etc.
Any retrospective revision in  prices is accounted for in the year of such revision.
Revenue is allocated between loyalty programs and  other components of the sale.
The amount allocated  to the loyalty program is deferred, and is recognised as  revenue when the Group has fulfilled its obligation to  supply the products under the terms of the program  or when it is no longer probable that the points under  the program will be redeemed.
Where the Group acts  as an agent on behalf of a third party, the associated  income is recognised on a net basis.
Sales are inclusive of all related expenses of the  Group that may be paid by the government based on  the provisions under agreements governing Group’s  activities in the respective field / project.
Any difference as of the reporting date between  the entitlement quantity minus the quantities sold  in respect of crude oil (including condensate), if  positive (i.e.
under lift quantity) the proportionate  production expenditure is treated as prepaid  expenses and, if negative (i.e.
over lift quantity),  a liability for the best estimate of the Group’s  proportionate share of production expenses as per  the Joint Operating Agreement ( JOA) / Production  Sharing Agreement (PSA) is created in respect of the  quantity of crude oil to be foregone in future period  towards settlement of the overlift quantity of crude  oil with corresponding charge to the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Any payment received in respect of short lifted gas  quantity for which an obligation exists to supply  such gas in subsequent periods is recognised as  Deferred Revenue in the year of receipt.
The same  is recognised as revenue in the year in which such  gas is actually supplied or in the year in which the  obligation to supply such gas ceases, whichever is  earlier.
The Group has entered into certain “take or pay”  arrangements with its customers which requires  the Group to deliver specified quantities as per the  arrangement.
In the event of short lifting by the  customer as per the terms of the arrangement, the  Group is entitled to receive revenue in respect of the  short lifted quantities.
Revenue in respect of short  lifted quantities under take or pay arrangements is  recognised when the Group’s obligation to supply  short-lifted quantity ceases as per the arrangement  and it is probable that the economic benefits will  flow to the Group.
Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of levies)  produced from Intangible assets under development  – Exploratory Wells in Progress / Oil & Gas assets  under development – Development Wells in  Progress is deducted from expenditure on such  wells.
Revenue in respect of the following is recognized  when there is a reasonable certainty regarding  ultimate collection:  • Surplus from Gas Pool Account  • Interest on delayed realization from customers  and delayed cash calls from JV partners  • Liquidated damages from contractors/suppliers 292  As per the Production Sharing Contracts for  extracting the Oil & Gas Reserves with Government  of India, out of the earnings from the exploitation of  reserves after recovery of cost, a part of the revenue  is paid to Government of India which is called Profit  Petroleum is reduced from the revenue from Sale of  Products as Government of India’s Share in Profit  Petroleum.
Finance income in respect of assets given on finance  lease is recognised based on a pattern reflecting a  constant periodic rate of return on the net investment  outstanding in respect of the finance lease.
Dividend and interest income  Dividend income from investments is recognised  when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is  established.
Interest income from financial assets is recognised,  when it is probable that the economic benefits will  flow to the Group and the amount of income can be  measured reliably.
Interest income is accrued on a  time basis by reference to the principal outstanding  and at the effective interest rate applicable on initial  recognition.
3.20 Leases  Leases are classified as finance leases whenever  the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the  risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an  asset to the Group.
All other leases are classified as  operating leases.
Land under perpetual lease are accounted as finance  leases which are recognized at upfront premium paid  for the lease and the present value of the lease rent  obligation.
The corresponding liability is recognised as  a finance lease obligation.
Land under non-perpetual  leases are treated as operating lease payments.
Operating lease payments are recognized as  prepayments and amortised on a straight-line basis  over the term of the lease.
Contingent rentals, if any,  arising under operating leases are recognised as an  expense in the period in which they are incurred.
3.21 Foreign Exchange T ransactions  Items included in the financial statements of each of  the Group’s entities are measured using the currency  of the primary economic environment in which the  entity operates (the “functional currency”).
The  consolidated financial statements are presented in  Indian Rupees (`), which is the Company’s functional  currency and the Group’s presentation currency.
T ransactions in currencies other than the respective  entities’ functional currency (foreign currencies)  are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing  at the dates of the transactions.
At the end of each  reporting period, monetary items denominated  in foreign currencies are retranslated using mean  exchange rate prevailing on the last day of the  reporting period.
Non-monetary items carried at  fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies  are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date  when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary  items that are measured in terms of historical cost in  a foreign currency are translated using the exchange  rates at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which they arise except  for exchange differences on foreign currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction  for future productive use, which are included in  the cost of those assets when they are regarded as  an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign  currency borrowings.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss in the period in which they arise  except for exchange differences on monetary item  that forms part of a Group’s net investment in a  foreign operation are recognised initially in other  comprehensive income and reclassified from equity  to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on  repayment of the monetary items.
Exchange difference arising in respect of long term  foreign currency monetary items is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss except for the  exchange difference related to long term foreign  currency monetary items recognized as at March  31, 2016, in so far as, these related to the acquisition  of depreciable assets, are adjusted against the cost of  such assets and depreciate the said adjustment, over  the balance life of asset and in other cases amortised  over the balance period  of the long term  foreign  currency monetary assets or liabilities.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e.
a disposal  Consolidated Financial Statements 293 of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation,  a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary  that includes a foreign operation, or a partial  disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an  associate that includes a foreign operation of which  the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all  of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in  respect of that operation attributable to the owners  of the Company are reclassified to the consolidated  statement of profit and loss.
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a  subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that  does not result in the Group losing control over the  subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated  exchange differences are re-attributed to non- controlling interests and are not recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
For  all other partial disposals (i.e.
partial disposals  of associates or joint arrangements that do not  result in the Group losing significant influence  or joint control), the proportionate share of the  accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed through  acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as  assets and liabilities of foreign operation and  translated at rate of exchange prevailing at the end of  each reporting period.
Exchange differences arising  are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Entities with functional currency other than  presentation currency are translated to the  presentation currency in Indian Rupees (`).
The  Group has applied the following principles for  translating its results and financial position from  functional currency to presentation currency (`):-  Assets and liabilities (excluding equity share capital  and other equity) for each balance sheet presented  (i.e.
including comparatives) has been translated at  the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;  Equity share capital including equity component  of compound financial instruments have been  translated at exchange rates at the dates of transaction.
Capital reserve has been translated at exchange rate  at the dates of transaction.
Other reserves have been  translated using average exchange rates of the period  to which it relates;  Income and expenses for each consolidated  statement of profit and loss presented have  been translated at exchange rates at the dates of  transaction except for certain items average rate for  the period is used; 3.22 Employee Benefits  Employee benefits include salaries, wages,  contributory provident fund, gratuity, leave  encashment towards un-availed leave, compensated  absences, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits.
All short term employee benefits are recognized  at their undiscounted amount in the accounting  period in which they are incurred.
Defined contribution plans  Employee Benefit under defined contribution  plans comprising contributory provident fund,  Post Retirement benefit scheme, Employee Pension  Scheme - 1995, composite social security scheme  etc.
is recognized based on the undiscounted  amount of obligations of the Group to contribute to  the plan.
The same is paid to a fund administered  through a separate trust.
Defined benefit plans  Defined retirement benefit plans comprising of  gratuity, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits, are recognized based on  the present value of defined benefit obligation  which is computed using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period.
These  are accounted either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Net interest on the net defined liability is calculated  by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the  period to the net defined benefit liability or asset  and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  except those included in cost of assets as permitted.
Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit plans  except for leave encashment towards un-availed  leave and compensated absences, comprising  actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes  to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return  on plan assets (excluding net interest as defined  294 above), are recognised in other comprehensive  income except those included in cost of assets as  permitted in the period in which they occur and are  not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group contributes all ascertained liabilities  with respect to gratuity to the respective Gratuity  Fund T rust.
All ascertained liabilities for un-availed  leave are funded with Life Insurance Corporation  of India (LIC) except in case of some subsidiaries.
Other defined benefit schemes are unfunded.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in  the Consolidated Financial Statements represents  the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined  benefit plans.
Any surplus resulting from this  calculation is limited to the present value of  any economic benefits available in the form of  reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Other long term employee benefits  Other long term employee benefit comprises of  leave encashment towards un-availed leave and  compensated absences, these are recognized based  on the present value of defined obligation which is  computed using the projected unit credit method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at the  end of each annual reporting period.
These are  accounted for either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Re-measurements of leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences are  recognized in the Statement of profit and loss except  those included in cost of assets as permitted in the  period in which they occur.
3.23 Voluntary Retirement Scheme  Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS) is charged to the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss when incurred.
3.24 General Administrative Expenses  General administrative expenses which are directly  attributable are allocated to activities and the  balance is charged to Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.25 Insurance claims  The Group accounts for insurance claims as under:-  In case of total loss of asset, by transferring either  the carrying cost of the relevant asset or insurance  value (subject to deductibles), whichever is lower  under the head “Claims Recoverable - Insurance”  on intimation to Insurer.
In case insurance claim is  less than carrying cost, the difference is charged to  consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
In case of partial or other losses, expenditure  incurred/payments made to put such assets back  into use, to meet third party or other liabilities  (less policy deductibles) if any, are accounted for  as “Claims Recoverable-Insurance” .
Insurance  Policy deductibles are expensed in the year the  corresponding expenditure is incurred.
As and when claims are finally received from the  insurer, the difference, if any, between Claims  Recoverable-Insurance and claims received is  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss.
3.26 Research and Development Expenditure  Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and  expenses of revenue nature are charged to the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, as and  when incurred.
3.27 Income T axes  Income tax expense represents the sum of the  current tax expense and deferred tax.
(i) Current tax   The tax currently payable is based on taxable  profit for the year.
T axable profit differs from  ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss because of items of  income or expense that are taxable or deductible  in other years and items that are never taxable or  deductible.
The Group’s current tax is calculated  using tax rates and laws that have been enacted  or substantively enacted by the end of the  reporting period.
Consolidated Financial Statements 295  (ii) Deferred tax   Deferred tax is recognised on temporary  differences between the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated  Financial Statements and the corresponding  tax bases used in the computation of taxable  profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally  recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised  for all deductible temporary differences to the  extent that it is probable that taxable profits  will be available against which those deductible  temporary differences can be utilised.
Such  deferred tax assets and liabilities are not  recognised if the temporary difference arises  from the initial recognition (other than in a  business combination) of assets and liabilities  in a transaction that affects neither the taxable  profit nor the accounting profit.
In addition,  deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the  temporary difference arises from the initial  recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at the end of each reporting period  and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profits will be  available to allow all or part of the deferred tax  asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  period in which the liability is settled or the asset  realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted by  the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would  follow from the manner in which the Group  expects, at the end of the reporting period, to  recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets  and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented  separately in Consolidated Balance sheet except  where there is a right of set-off within fiscal  jurisdictions and an intention to settle such  balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable  temporary differences associated with investment  in subsidiaries and associate and interests in joint  ventures, except where the Group is able to  control the reversal of the temporary difference  and it is probable that the temporary difference  will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible  temporary differences associated with such  interests are recognised only to the extent that  it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable  profits against which to utilise the benefits of the  temporary differences and they are expected to  reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative  T ax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws  in India, which is likely to give future economic  benefits in the form of availability of set off  against future income tax liability.
Accordingly,  MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet when the asset can  be measured reliably and it is probable that the  future economic benefit associated with asset  will be realised.
(iii) Current and deferred tax for the year   Current and deferred tax expense is recognised  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss, except when they relate to items that are  recognised in other comprehensive income  or directly in equity, in which case, the current  and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity  respectively.
3.28 Borrowing Costs  Borrowing costs specifically identified to the  acquisition or construction of qualifying assets is  capitalized as part of such assets.
A qualifying asset is  one that necessarily takes substantial period of time  to get ready for intended use.
All other borrowing  costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.29 Rig Days Costs  Rig movement costs are booked to the next location  drilled/planned for drilling.
Abnormal Rig days’  296 costs are considered as un-allocable and charged to  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.30 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Con- tingent Assets  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result  of a past event, it is probable that the Group will  be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best  estimate of the consideration required to settle the  present obligation at the end of the reporting period,  taking into account the risks and uncertainties  surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is  measured using the cash flows estimated to settle  the present obligation, its carrying amount is the  present value of those cash flows (when the effect of  the time value of money is material).
Contingent assets are disclosed in the Consolidated  Financial Statements by way of notes to accounts  when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the  Consolidated Financial Statements by way of notes  to accounts, unless possibility of an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefit is remote.
3.31 Financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are  recognised when Group becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value.
T ransaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of  financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  through profit or loss) are added to or deducted  from the fair value of the financial assets or financial  liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
T ransaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities  at fair value through profit or loss are recognised  immediately in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.32 Equity instruments  Equity instruments issued by the Company are  recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue  costs.
(i) Classification as debt or equity instruments   Debt and equity instruments issued by the  Company are classified as either financial  liabilities or as equity in accordance with the  substance of the contractual arrangements and  the definitions of a financial liability and an  equity instrument.
(ii) Compound financial instruments   The component parts of compound financial  instruments issued by the Group are classified  separately as financial liabilities and equity in  accordance with the substance of the contractual  arrangements.
A conversion option that will be  settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash  or another financial asset for a fixed number of  the Company’s own equity instruments is an  equity instrument.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the  liability component is estimated using the  prevailing market interest rate for similar  non-convertible instruments.
This amount  is recognised as a liability on an amortised  cost basis using the effective interest method  until extinguished upon conversion or at the  instrument’s maturity date.
The conversion  option classified as equity is determined  by deducting the amount of the liability  component from the fair value of the  compound financial instrument as a whole.
This is recognised and included in equity, net  of income tax effects, and is not subsequently  remeasured.
In addition, the conversion  option classified as equity will remain in  equity until the conversion option is exercised,  in which case, the balance recognised in equity  will be transferred to other component of  equity.
When the conversion option remains  unexercised at the maturity date of the  convertible note, the balance recognised in  Consolidated Financial Statements 297 equity will be transferred to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or  loss upon conversion or expiration of the  conversion option.
T ransaction costs that relate to the issue of the  convertible notes are allocated to the liability  and equity components in proportion to the  allocation of the gross proceeds.
T ransaction  costs relating to the equity component are  recognised directly in equity.
T ransaction  costs relating to the liability component are  included in the carrying amount of the liability  component and are amortised over the lives  of the convertible notes using the effective  interest method.
3.33 Financial assets  (i) Cash and cash equivalents    The Group considers all highly liquid financial  instruments, which are readily convertible  into known amounts of cash that are subject  to an insignificant risk of change in value and  having original maturities of three months  or less from the date of purchase, to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist  of balances with banks which are unrestricted  for withdrawal and usage.
(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost    Financial assets are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest  method if these financial assets are held within  a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms of the financial asset  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if these  financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial  assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest  on the principal amount outstanding.
The Group has made an irrevocable election  to present in other comprehensive income  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading.
(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through profit or loss unless it is measured at  amortised cost or at fair value through other  comprehensive income on initial recognition.
(v) Impairment of financial assets    The Group assesses at each Consolidated  Balance Sheet date whether a financial asset or a  group of financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109  ‘Financial Instruments’ requires expected credit  losses to be measured through a loss allowance.
The Group recognises lifetime expected losses  for trade receivables that do not constitute a  financing transaction.
For all other financial  assets, expected credit losses are measured at  an amount equal to 12 month expected credit  losses or at an amount equal to lifetime expected  losses, if the credit risk on the financial asset has  increased significantly since initial recognition.
(vi) Derecognition of financial assets   The Group derecognises a financial asset when  the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  asset expire, or when it transfers the financial  asset and substantially all the risks and rewards  of ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety (except for equity instruments  designated as FVTOCI), the difference between  the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of  the consideration received and receivable is  recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.34 Financial liabilities   (i) Financial liabilities    Financial liabilities are measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest method.
298  (ii) Derecognition of financial liabilities   The Group derecognises financial liabilities  when, and only when, the Group’s obligations  are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The  difference between the carrying amount of  the financial liability derecognised and the  consideration paid and payable is recognised in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.35 Derivative financial instruments   The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial  instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate  and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign  exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at  the date the derivative contracts are entered into and  are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at  the end of each reporting period.
The resulting gain  or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately  unless the derivative is designated and effective as  a hedging instrument, in which event the timing  of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the  nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of  the hedged item.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host  contracts that are not financial assets within the  scope of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ are  treated as separate derivatives when their risks and  characteristics are not closely related to those of the  host contracts and the host contracts are not measured  at fair value through profit & Loss (FVTPL).
3.36 Offsetting of financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet  if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset  the recognized amounts and there is an intention to  settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle  the liabilities simultaneously.
3.37 Investment property  Investment properties are properties held to earn  rentals and/or for capital appreciation.
Investment  properties are measured initially at cost, including  transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition,  investment properties are measured in accordance  with Ind AS 16 requirements for cost model.
The Group depreciates building component of  investment property over 30 years from the date  of original construction, based on the useful  life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013 using the straight-line method.
The  management believes that these estimated useful  lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the  period over which the assets are likely to be used.
An investment property is derecognized upon  disposal or when the investment property is  permanently withdrawn from use and no future  economic benefits are expected from the disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the  property (calculated as the difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of  the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period  in which the property is derecognized.
3.38 Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing  the net profit after tax by the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the  period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by  dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average  number of equity shares considered for deriving  basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have  been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential  equity shares.
3.39 Statement of Cash Flows   Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects  of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or  accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and item of income or expenses associated  with investing or financing cash flows.
The cash  flows are segregated into operating, investing and  financing activities.
3.40 Segment Reporting  Operating segments are identified and reported  taking into account the different risks and returns,  the organization structure and the internal reporting  systems.
The geographical segments are based on  assets as primary segments and business segments  as secondary segments.

Critical Accounting Judgments, Assumptions and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty  Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated Ind AS Financial  Statements is the need for Management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of  revenues and expenses.
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
Key source of judgments, assumptions and estimation uncertainty in the preparation of the Consolidated Ind AS  Financial Statements which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within  the next financial year, are in respect of functional currency, Oil and Gas reserves, impairment, useful lives of Property,  Plant and Equipment, depletion of oil and gas assets, decommissioning provision, employee benefit obligations,  provisions, provision for income tax,  measurement of deferred tax assets and contingent assets & liabilities.
5.1 Critical judgments in applying accounting policies  The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (Refer note 5.2), that the  Management have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the significant  effect on the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.
(a) Determination of functional currency   Currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group’s entities operates (“the functional  currency”) is Indian Rupee (`) in which the entities primarily generates and expends cash.
However, primary  economic environment in which OVL group (ONGC Videsh Ltd and its subsidiaries) is US Dollar which is  the currency in which it primarily generates and expends cash and accordingly the functional currency of OVL  group has been assessed as US Dollar.
302  (b) Classification of investment   Judgement is required in assessing the level of  control obtained in a transaction to acquire  an interest in another entity; depending upon  the facts and circumstances in each case, the  Company may obtain control, joint control  or significant influence over the entity or  arrangement.
T ransactions which give the  Company control of a business are business  combinations.
If the Company obtains joint  control of an arrangement, judgement is also  required to assess whether the arrangement is a  joint operation or a joint venture.
If the Company  has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a  position to exercise significant influence over the  entity, which is then classified as an associate.
(i) In ONGC Petro additions Limited as joint  venture (OPaL)  The Company has 49.36% equity interest in OPaL.
The Company has also subscribed for 1,922 million  share warrants on August 25, 2015 entitling the  Company to exchange each warrant with an equity  share of face value of  `10 each against which ` 9.75  has been paid.
Further the Company has also entered into an  arrangement on July 2, 2016 for backstopping  support towards repayment of principal and  cumulative coupon amount for compulsorily  convertible debentures amounting to    `77,780.00  million issued by ONGC Petro additions Limited  and interest for the year ending March 31, 2018  amounting to  `4,670.19 million.
The Management has however evaluated the interest  in OPaL to be in the nature of joint venture as the  shareholder agreement between all the shareholders  provides for sharing of control of the decisions  of relevant activities that require the unanimous  consent of all the parties sharing control.
(ii) In associates despite participating share  being less than 20%   Considering the power to participate in the  financial and operating policy decisions  of the investees exercised by the Group in  accordance with the applicable agreements  and /or otherwise, the following entities are  considered associates of the Group despite the  participating interest/shareholding percentage/  right percentage being less than 20%:   • South East Asia Gas Pipeline (shareholding  of the Group 8.347%)   • Petro Carabobo S.A., Venezuela  (shareholding of the Group 11%)   The Company has 12.50% equity interest in  PLL.
It was classified as Joint Venture in Previous  GAAP , however, in terms of Para 7 of Ind AS 111  “Joint Arrangements” , unanimous consent of all  promoters is not required in relevant activities in  PLL and therefore PLL is not classified as Joint  Venture.
The Company has significant influence  on PLL by way of having right to appoint a  director in PLL and participate in its business  decisions, therefore the same has been classified  as an Associate of the Company.
(c) In Joint venture despite participating share more  than 50%  In case of HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd. (HRRL)  and CREDA HPCL Biofuels Ltd. (CHBL) wherein  subsidiary company HPCL held majority voting  rights of these companies (74% stake), other JV  partner has substantive participative rights through  its right to affirmative vote items.
Accordingly, being  a company with joint control, HRRL and CHBL  have been considered as Joint Venture company  for the purpose of consolidation of financial  statement under Ind AS.
However for the purpose  of Companies Act 2013, these companies have been  classified as subsidiary companies as defined under  section 2 therein (d) Determining whether an arrangement contain  leases and classification of leases  The group enters into service / hiring arrangements  for various assets / services.
The determination  of lease and classification of the service / hiring  arrangement as a finance lease or operating lease is  based on an assessment of several factors, including,  but not limited to, transfer of ownership of leased  asset at end of lease term, lessee’s option to purchase  and estimated certainty of exercise of such option,  proportion of lease term to the asset’s economic  life, proportion of present value of minimum lease  payments to fair value of leased asset and extent of  specialized nature of the leased asset.
Consolidated Financial Statements 303 (e) Evaluation of indicators for impairment of Oil  and Gas Assets  The evaluation of applicability of indicators of  impairment of assets requires assessment of external  factors (significant decline in asset’s value, significant  changes in the technological, market, economic or  legal environment, market interest rates etc.)
and  internal factors (obsolescence or physical damage  of an asset, poor economic performance of the asset  etc.)
which could result in significant change in  recoverable amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.
(f ) Oil & Gas Accounting  The determination of whether potentially economic  oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by  an exploration well is usually made within one year  of well completion, but can take longer, depending  on the complexity of the geological structure.
Exploration wells that discover potentially economic  quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where  major capital expenditure (e.g.
an offshore platform  or a pipeline) would be required before production  could begin, and where the economic viability of  that major capital expenditure depends on the  successful completion of further exploration work  in the area, remain capitalized on the consolidated  balance sheet as long as additional exploration or  appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
It is not unusual to have exploration wells and  exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells remaining  suspended on the consolidated balance sheet for  several years while additional appraisal drilling and  seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field  is performed or while the optimum development  plans and timing are established.
All such carried  costs are subject to regular technical, commercial  and management review on at least an annual basis  to confirm the continued intent to develop, or  otherwise extract value from, the discovery.
Where  this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately  expensed.
(g) Deferred tax liability / deferred tax asset in  respect of undistributed profits/losses of  subsidiaries, branches, investments in associates  and joint ventures  The management exercises judgement in accounting  for deferred tax liability / deferred tax asset in respect  of Group’s investments in respect of undistributed  profits/losses of subsidiaries, branches, investments  in associates and joint ventures.
In the judgement of  the management, in respect of undistributed profits/ losses of subsidiaries, branches, investments in joint  ventures, the management is able to control the  timing of the reversal of the temporary differences  and the temporary differences will not be reversed  in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group does not recognise a deferred  tax liability for all taxable temporary differences  associated with investments in subsidiaries,  branches and interests in joint ventures.
5.2.
Assumptions and key sources of estimation  uncertainty  Information about estimates and assumptions  that have the significant effect on recognition and  measurement of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses is provided below.
Actual results may  differ from these estimates.
(a) Estimation of provision  for decommissioning   The Group estimates provision for decommissioning  as per the principles of Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ for  the future decommissioning of Oil & Gas assets  at the end of their economic lives.
Most of these  decommissioning activities would be in the future,  the exact requirements that may have to be met  when the removal events occur involve uncertainty.
T echnologies and costs for decommissioning are  constantly changing.
The timing and amounts  of future cash flows are subject to significant  uncertainty.
The timing and amount of future expenditures  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,  together with rate of inflation for escalation of  current cost estimates and the interest rate used  in discounting the cash flows.
The economic life  of the Oil & Gas assets is estimated on the basis of  long term production profile of the relevant Oil &  Gas asset.
(b) Impairment of assets  Determination as to whether, and by how much, a  CGU is impaired involves Management estimates  on uncertain matters such as future prices, the  effects of inflation on operating expenses, discount  rates, production profiles for crude oil, natural gas  304 and value added  products.
For Oil & Gas assets,  the expected future cash flows are estimated using  Management’s best estimate of future crude oil and  natural gas prices, production and reserves volumes.
The company’s present values of cash flows are  determined by applying pre tax-discount rates for  crude oil and value added products revenue, which  are measured in USD.
Future cash inflows from sale  of crude oil and value added products are computed  using the future prices, on the basis of market-based  average prices of the Dated Brent crude oil as per  assessment by ‘Platt’s Crude Oil Market wire’ and  its co-relations with benchmark crudes and other  petroleum products.
Future cash flows from sale of  natural gas are also computed based on the expected  future prices on the basis of the notification issued by  the Government of India and discounted applying  the rate applicable to the cash flows measured in  USD in view of the new pricing guidelines issued by  GoI.
Further, the subsidiary company ONGC Videsh  Ltd,  present values of cash flows are determined by  applying pre tax-discount rates that reflects current  market assessments of time value of money and the  risks specific to the liability in respect of each of the  CGUs.
Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil  are computed using the future prices, on the basis  of market-based forward prices of the Dated Brent  crude oil as per assessment by Bloomberg and its  co-relations with benchmark crudes and other  petroleum products.
Future cash flows from sale of  natural gas are also computed based on the expected  future prices on the basis of the prices determined in  accordance with the respective agreements and / or  market forecast.
The discount rate used is based upon the cost of  capital from an established model.
The Value in use of the producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage approach,  wherein future cash flows are initially estimated  based on Proved Developed Reserves.
Under  circumstances where the further development of  the fields in the CGUs is under progress and where  the carrying value of the CGUs is not likely to be  recovered through exploitation of proved developed  reserves alone, the Proved and probable reserves  (2P) of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose  of estimating future cash flows.
In such cases,  full estimate of the expected cost of evaluation/ development is also considered while determining  the value in use.
The discount rates applied in the assessment of  impairment calculation are re-assessed each year.
(c) Estimation of reserves  Management estimates production profile (proved  and developed reserves) in relation to all the  Oil and Gas Assets based on the policies and  procedures determined by the Reserves Estimation  Committee of the Company (REC).
The estimates  so determined are used for the computation of  depletion and impairment testing.
The year-end reserves of the Group have been  estimated by the REC which follows international  reservoir engineering procedures consistently.
The  Company has adopted deterministic approach  for reserves estimation and is following Society  of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) – 1997 guidelines  which defines reserves as “estimated volumes of  crude oils, condensate, natural gas, natural gas  liquids and associated substances anticipated  to be commercially recoverable from known  accumulations from a given date forward, under  existing economic conditions, by established  operating practices, and under current Government  regulations.
” Volumetric estimation is the main  procedure in estimation, which uses reservoir rock  and fluid properties to calculate hydrocarbons in- place and then estimate that portion which will be  recovered from it.
As the field gets matured with  reasonably good production history available then  performance methods such as material balance,  simulation, decline curve analysis are applied to get  more accurate assessments of reserves.
The annual revision of estimates is based on the  yearly exploratory and development activities and  results thereof.
New in- place Volume and Ultimate  Reserves are estimated for new field discoveries  or new pool discoveries in already discovered  fields.
Also, appraisal activities lead to revision in  estimates due to new sub-surface data.
Similarly,  reinterpretation exercise is also carried out for old  fields due to necessity of revision in petro-physical  parameters, updating of static and dynamic models  Consolidated Financial Statements 305 and performance analysis leading to change in reserves.
Intervention of new technology, change in classifications  and contractual provisions also necessitate revision in estimation of reserves.
The Group uses the services of third party agencies for due diligence and it gets the reserves of its assets audited  by third party periodically by internationally reputed consultants who adopt latest industry practices for their  evaluation.
(d) Determination of cash generating unit (CGU)  The Group is engaged mainly in the business of oil and gas exploration and production in Onshore and Offshore.
In case of onshore assets, the fields are using common production/transportation facilities and are sufficiently  economically interdependent to constitute a single cash generating unit (CGU).
Accordingly, impairment test of all  onshore fields in India is performed in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a  field is generally considered as CGU except for fields which are developed as a Cluster, for which common facilities  are used, in which case the impairment testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields included in the cluster.
(e) Defined benefit obligation (DBO)   Management’s estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical underlying assumptions such as standard rates  of inflation, medical cost trends, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future salary increases.
Variation in  these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses.

The recovery is towards  certain observations raised by auditors appointed  by the Director General of Hydrocarbons (DGH)  under Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the  period 2002-03 to 2005-06 in respect of cost and  profit petroleum share payable to GoI.
BGEPIL  along with RIL (“Claimants”) have served a notice  of arbitration on the GoI in respect of dispute,  differences and claims arisen in connection with  the terms of Panna, Mukta and T apti PSCs.
Since  the Company is not a party to the arbitration  proceedings, it had requested MoP&NG that in case  of an arbitral award the same be made applicable  to ONGC also, as a constituent of contractor for  both the PSCs.
Subsequently, vide letter dated  July 4, 2011 MoP&NG has advised ONGC not  to participate in the arbitration initiated by RIL  and BGEPIL under Panna Mukta and T apti PSCs.
MoP&NG has also stated that in case of an arbitral  award, the same will be applicable to ONGC also as  a constituent of the contractor for both the PSCs.
A Final Partial Award (FPA) was pronounced by  the T ribunal in the arbitration matter between RIL,  BGEPIL and Union of India.
RIL and BGEPIL the JV partners have challenged  the FPA before the English Commercial Court.
Pending final quantification of liabilities by the  Arbitration T ribunal and decision of English  Commercial Court, the same has been shown as  Receivable from GoI under ‘ Advance Recoverable  in Cash under financial assets - others.

18.2 In Ravva Joint Operation, the demand towards  additional profit petroleum raised by Government  of India (GoI), due to differences in interpretation  of the provisions of the Production Sharing  Contract (PSC) in respect of computation of Post  T ax Rate of Return (PTRR), based on the decision  of the Malaysian High Court setting aside an earlier  arbitral tribunal award in favor of operator, was  disputed by the operator M/s Cairn India Limited.
The Company is not a party to the dispute but has  agreed to abide by the decision applicable to the  operator.
The Company  is carrying an amount of    `  10,896.48 million (equivalent to USD 167.84  million) after adjustments for interest and exchange  rate fluctuations which has been recovered by GoI,  this includes interest amounting to USD 54.88  million (`  3,562.81 million).
The Company has  made impairment provision towards this recovery  made by the GoI.
In subsequent legal proceedings, the Appellate  Authority of the Honorable Malaysian High Court  of Kuala Lumpur had set aside the decision of the  Malaysian High Court and the earlier decision of  arbitral tribunal in favour of operator was restored,  against which the GoI has preferred an appeal before  the Federal Court of Malaysia.
The Federal Court of  Malaysia, vide its order dated October 11, 2011, has  dismissed the said appeal of the GoI.
The Company has taken up the matter regarding  refund of the recoveries made in view of the  favorable judgment of the Federal Court of  Malaysia with MoP&NG.
However, according to a  communication dated January 13, 2012 received,  MoP&NG expressed the view that ONGC’s  proposal would be examined when the issue of  ONGC carry under Ravva PSC is decided in its  entirety by the Government along with other  partners.
In view of the perceived uncertainties in obtaining  the refund at this stage, the impairment made in  the books as above has been retained and netted  off against the amount recoverable as above in the  Consolidated Financial Statements for the year  ending March 31, 2018.

These  risks include market risk (including currency risk  and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
In case of subsidiary OVL, the Company’s  management seeks to minimise the effects of these  risks by using derivative financial instruments  to hedge risk exposures.
The use of financial  derivatives is governed by the company’s policies  approved by the Board of Directors, which provide  written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest  rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives  and non-derivative financial instruments, and the  investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with  policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the  internal auditors on a continuous basis.
The Group  does not enter into or trade financial instruments,  including derivative financial instruments, for  speculative purposes.
In case of subsidiary, HPCL, the Company’s has  adopted a well-defined process for managing its  risks on an ongoing basis and for conducting the  business in a risk conscious manner.
There are  defined processes for identification, assessment  and mitigation of risks on an ongoing basis.
Risk  assessment is considered as critical input for  decision making related to strategy formulation and  capital allocation.
Y our Group has also leveraged  technology to integrate and automate the entire  process of enterprise risk management.
The Group  has also engaged the services of an independent  expert to assist in continued implementation of  effective Risk Management framework and improve  the framework further.
These self-regulatory ERM  processes and procedures form part of our Risk  Management Charter and Policy, 2007.
Risk Management Steering Committee (RMSC)  continues to provide its guidance in this regard.
Y our Group has put in place mechanism to inform  Board Members about the risk assessment and  minimization procedures, and periodical review to  ensure that executive management controls risks by  means of a properly identified framework.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial  instruments, including derivative financial  instruments, for speculative purposes.
49.4 Market Risk  Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from  possible market price movements and their impact  on the future performance of a business.
The major  components of market risk are commodity price  risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The primary commodity price risks that the  Company is exposed to include international crude  oil prices that could adversely affect the value of  the Company’s financial assets or expected future  cash flows.
Substantial or extended decline in  international prices of crude oil and natural gas may  have an adverse effect on the Company’s reported  results.
Subsidiary Company OVL enters into a variety  of derivative financial instruments to manage its  exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate  risk, including:  (a) interest rate swaps to mitigate the variable of  rising interest rate.
(b) forward foreign exchange contract to hedge its  exposure in respect of Euro bond issued by the  Company and for certain payments in Russian  Rouble.
49.5.

The  Company is, therefore, exposed to foreign currency  risk principally out of INR appreciating against  USD.
Foreign currency risks on account of receipts  / revenue and payments / expenses are managed by  netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures  through export earnings, wherever possible  and carry unhedged exposures for the residual  considering the natural hedge available to it from  domestic sales.
404  The Company undertakes transactions  denominated in different foreign currencies and  consequently exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within  approved policy parameters.

In  current year, the Company has entered certain  forward contracts to cover exposure towards  EURO bond.
49.6 Interest rate risk management  The Group has availed borrowings at fixed and  floating interest rates, hence is exposed to interest  rate risk.
49.6.1 Interest rate sensitivity analysis  In respect of company,  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because  the Company has borrowed funds benchmarked to  overnight MCLR, T reasury Bills and USD LIBOR.
The Company’s exposure to interest rates on  financial liabilities are detailed in note 28.2.
In respect of subsidiary company MRPL,  The sensitivity analyses below have been  determined based on the exposure to interest rates  at the end of the reporting period.
For floating rate  borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the  amount of the borrowings outstanding at the end of  the reporting period was outstanding for the whole  year.
A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used for  disclosing the sensitivity analysis.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/ lower and all other variables were held constant, the  Group’s profit for the year ended March 31, 2018  would decrease/increase by `  613.00 million (for  the year ended March 31, 2017 : decrease/increase  by ` 404.64 million).
This is mainly attributable to  the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable  rate borrowings.
In respect of subsidiary company OVL,  The sensitivity analyses below have been determined  based on the exposure to interest rates for both  derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the  end of the reporting year.
For floating rate liabilities,  the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the  liability outstanding at the end of the reporting year  was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis point  increase or decrease is used when reporting interest  rate risk internally to key management personnel  and represents management’s assessment of the  reasonably possible change in interest rates.
406  If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the analysis  is as under: (` in million) Particulars For the year ended March 31, 2018 For the year ended March 31, 2017 USD 1,775  million T erm  loan USD 500  million T erm  loan JPY 38 billion  T erm loan USD 1,775  million T erm  loan USD 500  million T erm  loan JPY 38 billion  T erm loan (a) Impact on profit or loss  for the year for increase in  interest rate              572.18          137.56          110.60            595.62                   -                      -    (b) Impact on profit or loss for  the year for decrease  in  interest rate           (572.18)         (137.56)         (110.60)           (595.62)                   -                      -     Interest rate swap contracts  The subsidiary company OVL is engaged in E&P business outside India.
Its revenues of crude oil and natural gas  are principally denominated in USD.
Further, price benchmarks wherever applicable are also principally in USD.
The Company has therefore swapped the coupon and the principal amount of 8.54 % Unsecured Redeemable  Debenture (face value of ` 3700 Million) into USD.
In respect of subsidiary company HPCL,  Company has long-term foreign currency syndicated loans with floating rate, which expose the company to cash  flow interest rate risk.
The borrowings at floating rate were denominated in USD.
The Company manages its cash  flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Under these swaps, the Company agrees with  other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (i.e.
quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and  floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
Company monitors  the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on the Company’s Forex Risk Management  Policy.
The Company also has a Forex Risk Management Cell (FRMC) which actively review the forex and interest  rate exposures.
The Company does not uses derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
‘The Company’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost.
They are therefore not subject to interest rate  risk as defined in Ind AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a  change in market interest rates.

54 Disclosure under Indian Accounting Standard  36 – Impairment of Assets  54.1 The Company is engaged mainly in the business of  oil and gas exploration and production in On-shore  and Offshore.
In case of onshore assets, the fields are  using common production/transportation facilities  and are sufficiently economically interdependent  to constitute a single cash generating unit (CGU).
Accordingly, impairment test of all onshore fields is  performed in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset  Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field is generally  considered as CGU except for fields which are  developed as a Cluster, for which common facilities  are used, in which case the impairment testing is  performed in aggregate for all the fields included in  the cluster.
54.2 The Value in Use of producing/developing CGUs  is determined under a multi-stage approach,  wherein future cash flows are initially estimated  based on Proved Developed Reserves.
Under the  circumstances where further development of the  fields in the CGUs is under progress and where  the carrying value of the CGUs is not likely to be  recovered through exploitation of proved developed  reserves alone, the Proved and probable reserves  (2P) of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose  of estimating future cash flows.
In such cases,  full estimate of the expected cost of evaluation/ development is also considered while determining  the value in use.
54.3 In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows from the continuing use of assets and from its  disposal at the end of its useful life are discounted to  their present value.
The present value of cash flows  has been determined by applying discount rates of  14.48% (as at March 31, 2017 - 14.88 %) for Rupee  transactions and 9.68% (as at March 31, 2017- 10.57  %) for crude oil and value added products revenue,  which are measured in USD.
Future cash inflows  from sale of crude oil and value added products  have been computed using the future prices, on the  basis of market-based average prices of dated Brent  crude oil as per ‘Platt’s Crude oil market wire’ and  its Co-relations with benchmark crude and other  petroleum products.
Future cash flows from sale of  natural gas are also computed based on the expected  future prices on the basis of notification issued by  the Government of India and discounted applying  the rate applicable to the cash flows measured in  USD in view of the new pricing guidelines issued by  GOI.
(Refer Note 35.3) 54.4 The company has assessed the impairment as at  March 31, 2018 for its CGUs.
There has been an  improvement in prices of Crude Oil and Natural  Gas in the current financial year.
As a result of the  change in prices and other variables, there has been  a reversal of an amount of ` 6,985.33 million (As  on 31 March, 2017  ` 13,979.63 million) mainly  consisting of  ` 6,954.96 million (As on 31 March,  2017  ` 12,203.54 million) for onshore CGU  Sibsagar and balance reversal of impairment pertains  to other CGUs.
54.5 During the year ` 1,342.92 million (Previous year  ` 715.62 million) has been provided for impairment  loss mainly consisting of onshore CGU Silchar and  Jodhpur amounting to ` 241.96 million (Previous  year  ` 235.11 million).
Balance impairment loss  432 amounting to ` 1,100.96 million (Previous year   ` 480.51 million) pertains to T apti field, CB-OS- 1and other CGUs.
54.6 The following 2P reserves for respective CGU were  considered as a basis for the impairment testing as at  March 31, 2018: Name of the CGU Quantity of Reserves used  for Impairment Assessment  (In MMT) G1 GS 15 8.65 Silchar Onshore Asset 0.32 RJ-ON-90/1  (Pre NELP PSC Block) 5.10 Sibsagar Onshore Asset 40.75 WO 16 12.25 Rajahmundry Onshore 13.74 54.7 In respect of Company, impairment testing of assets  under exploratory phase (Exploratory wells in  progress) has been carried out as on March 31, 2018  and an amount of ` 1,820.94 million (For the year  ended March 31, 2017 ` 4,539.44 million) has been  provided during the year 2017-18 as impairment  loss.
Further,  ` 1,065.43 million (For the year ended  March 31, 2017  ` 966.05 million) impairment  losses has been reversed in the Standalone statement  of Profit and Loss as exploratory phase assets have  been transferred to dry well expenditure.
54.8 The subsidiary, OVL carried out impairment test as  at March 31, 2018 in respect of its Cash Generating  Units (CGUs) based on value in use method.
The  Company identified write back of impairment in  respect of two CGUs and impairment in respect  of three CGUs and recognised net write back  of impairment of ` 2,740.12 million during the  year ended March 31, 2018 (for the year ended  March 31, 2017 net impairment provision of  ` 10,062.78 million was recognised including write  back of impairment in respect of two CGUs and  impairment in respect of three CGUs).
The current  year provision for impairment is considered as  exceptional item.

The  Group has reviewed all its pending litigations  and proceedings and has made adequate  provisions, wherever required and disclosed  the contingent liabilities, wherever applicable,  in its financial statements.
The Group does  not expect the outcome of these proceedings to  have a material impact on its financial position.

Based on legal opinion obtained  by the Company, service tax / GST on royalty is  not applicable.
The Company is contesting the  same at appropriate authorities and accordingly  the same has been shown as contingent liability.
However, as an abundant caution, the company  has deposited Service tax, GST and interest on  GST under protest in May, 2018 amounting to  ` 25,153.29 million.
55.1.3 The Company, with 40% Participating Interest  (PI), is a Joint Operator in Panna-Mukta and  Mid and South T apti Fields along with Reliance  Industries Limited (RIL) and BG Exploration  and Production India Limited (BGEPIL),  each having 30% PI.
The Production Sharing  Contracts (PSCs) with respect to Panna- Mukta and Mid and South T apti contract areas  were signed between the Contractors and  Government of India on December 22, 1994  for a period of 25 years.
In December 2010, RIL  & BGEPIL invoked an arbitration proceeding  against the Union of India in respect of certain  disputes, differences and claims arising out of  or in connection with both the PSCs in respect  to Panna-Mukta and Mid and South T apti  contract areas pursuant to the provisions of  Article 33 of the PSCs and UNCITRAL Rules,  1976.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural  Gas (MoP&NG), vide letter dated July 4, 2011,  had advised the Company not to participate in  the arbitration initiated by RIL and BGEPIL  under Panna-Mukta & T apti PSCs.
However,  in case of an arbitral award, the same will be  applicable to the Company also as a constituent  of the contractor for both the PSCs.
On October  12, 2016, a Final Partial Award (FPA) was  pronounced by the T ribunal in the arbitration  matter between RIL, BGEPIL and Union of  India.
However, details of proceedings in this  regard are not known to the Company since  the Company is not a party to this arbitration.
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH),  vide letter dated May 25, 2017 marked to all Joint  Venture Partners (RIL, BGEPIL & ONGC) has  asked for payment of  differential GOI share  of Profit Petroleum and Royalty alleged to be  payable by contractor pursuant to Governments  interpretation of the FPA  (40% share of the  Company  amounting to US$ 1,574.76 million  equivalent to  `  102,233.41 million including  interest up to November 30, 2016).
However, in  response to letter dated May 25, 2017 of DGH,  RIL and BGEPIL the JV partners (with a copy  marked to all the Joint Venture partners) have  stated that demand of DGH is premature as the  FPA does not make any money award in favour  of GOI as quantification of liabilities are to be  determined during the final proceedings of the  434 arbitration and the same has been challenged  before the English Commercial Court.
Further, subsequent to London High Court  Orders dated April 16, 2018 and May  2,  2018,  DGH vide letter dated May 4, 2018 and May  15, 2018 has asked for re-casting of accounts of  the JV and for remitting respective PI share of  balance dues including interest till the date of  remittance.
Details of proceedings thereof and  the London High Court orders are not known  to the Company since the Company is not a  party to the arbitration.
In response to the letter  of DGH RIL & BGEPIL have responded (with  a copy marked to all the Joint Venture partners)  that FPA of October 2016 does not make any  money award in favour of the Government.
Further it has also been stated by RIL & BGEPIL  that the English Court has upheld challenge 4 of  the claimants (RIL & BGEPIL) in relation to  “ Agreement Case” and held that there had been a  serious irregularity in the Award of the T ribunal.
Further in the court order of May 2, 2018, the  English Court has directed the T ribunal to re- consider the “ Agreement Case” and issue a fresh  award within three months of that date.
The  “ Agreement Case” is closely linked with the  Cost recovery limit (CRL) increase application  filed by the contractor with the Management  Committee and T ribunals re-consideration  of this issue necessarily impacts the re- computation of accounts.
Re-computation of  accounts and consequential determination of  any amount due and payable by the contractor  (Constituents of the JV including the Company)  are to be determined during the final stage of the  arbitration proceedings after determination of  all substantive issues by the T ribunal (including  any application for an increase in the T apti  and Panna Mukta CRL and an award on the  Agreement Case).
The Company has also  responded to DGH that as of now, neither the  Arbitral T ribunal nor the Court has passed  any order or quantified any amount due and  payable by the Company.
In the circumstances,  the demand of DGH from the Company for  any sum or interest thereon is premature and  not justified.
The company has requested DGH  to keep the issue in abeyance till finality in the  award is achieved.
Pending the final quantification of liabilities by the  Arbitration T ribunal, no provision for the same has  been considered necessary.
However, the same has  been considered as contingent liability.
55.2 Contingent asset   A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from  past events and whose existence will be confirmed  only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within  the control of the entity.
During the normal course  of business, several unresolved claims are currently  outstanding.
The inflow of economic benefits, in  respect of such claims cannot be measured due to  uncertainties that surround the related events and  circumstances.
