The narrative of the global energy industry, particularly its  upstream segment, over the past three years has mostly talked  about the ‘lower for longer’ crude oil prices and its impact on  approval of new projects.
Irrespective of this, the upstream  segment continues to remain fundamentally significant to the  health and development of global economies.
In this context, I must sincerely acknowledge the trust and  confidence you have placed in the Company during the  recent years.
As always, we remain committed to pursuing  growth opportunities not only ensuring expansion of our  businesses but also creating value for all our stakeholders  in a sustainable manner.
With this note, I, on behalf of the Board of Directors of  ONGC, country’s most valued public sector enterprise,  and over 33,000 dedicated energy soldiers, present to you  the Annual Report for the financial year 2016-17.
Crude oil prices, even today, are less than half of their  average level during January, 2011 to June, 2014.
Price  recovery, despite OPEC’s efforts, has not been as effective  a s  u p s t r e a m  c o m p a n i e s  w o u l d  l i k e  t o  s e e .
I n v e s t m e n t   levels in E&P globally, though improved a bit since  mid-2016, continue to remain subdued.
Your Company’s performance, as well as that of its other  group companies, in this period of uncertainty reflects its  ability to adapt quickly, plan appropriately and act  effectively in an otherwise challenging environment.
In a   period when operational efficiency and capital discipline  have become buzzwords for a sound business model, our  operational and financial numbers yet again bear ample  testimony to the competitiveness of our core operations,  impressive inherent value of our assets and a strong  balance sheet.
In FY’17, your Company made 23 hydrocarbon  discoveries with total reserve accretion of 64.54 Million  Tonnes of Oil and Oil Equivalent Gas.
The overall 2P Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR) was 1.45, making it the 11 th consecutive year when the Company has recorded an RRR in excess of ‘one’.
This is really impressive by all standards.
At the same time, cost of finding new hydrocarbons in  FY’17 was 11 percent lower than that of FY’ 16.
What  further adds sheen to this performance, was the fact that  your Company successfully monetised 8 out of the 13  onshore discoveries within the same year.
It reaffirms a  more disciplined and focused approach in project  execution adopted during the year and the mind-set of our  teams understanding urgency for monetisation of our  resources.
ONGC, credited with establishing six out of  the seven producing basins in India, is now planning to  add Kutch Saurashtra basin to country’s hydrocarbon  production map.
Constant efforts on the production front in FY’17 have  yielded meaningful results.
Standalone domestic output  from the ONGC-operated fields during the year stood at  22.25 MMT as compared to 22.37 MMT in the preceding  fiscal.
While this represents a marginal y-o-y drop,  disrupting two consecutive years of stable production, we  are positive of a turnaround in FY’18 on the back of  completion of ongoing offshore development projects as  well as recent strong performance of onshore fields.
During FY’17, declining crude oil production trend was  reversed – onshore crude production increased in FY’17  to 5.97 MMT against 5.83 MMT in FY’16.
The increase is  expected to continue during the current fiscal.
The Company also recorded a strong year in terms of  domestic gas production, which registered an increase of  4.3% – from 21.18 BCM in FY’16 to 22.09 BCM during  FY’17 , the first increase in last four years.
Gas production  increased in onshore fields by 9% and in offshore fields by  3% over FY’16.
Drilling performance also improved significantly, with  drilling of 501 wells – the highest-ever.
Drilling efficiency,  in terms of metres drilled per rig-month, improved by 25%  i n  FY’ 1 7  a s  c o m p a r e d  t o  FY’ 1 6 .
D r i l l i n g  c o s t  p e r - m e t e r   declined notably by 18% due to improved operational  efficiency, introduction of new technology and reduction  in cost of hired services.
While your Company is, by far, India’s most dominant  domestic oil and gas producer, what continues to be of  concern and is of larger interest to the nation, is the degree  of our dependence on hydrocarbon imports.
Over the past  10 years, the forex outgo on account of crude oil imports  stands at USD 1 trillion – a staggering number by any  measure.
Hon’ble PM has given an ambitious target to  achieve a 10% reduction in imports by the year 2022.
This  is a clear indication of severity of the issue and its potential  implications for the country’s energy security.
Emphasis  on augmentation of domestic hydrocarbon production  was clearly outlined as part of the overall strategy outlined  in the industry roadmap designed to deliver on the PM’s  vision of greater energy self-sufficiency.
Over the past three years, while most of the global  upstream companies have held back project investment  decisions, ONGC has adopted a counter-cyclical  approach.
ONGC believes that this is the right time to  execute E&P projects when cost of oilfield services and  equipment is lower in sympathy to lower crude prices and  lower level of project activity globally resulting in  keenness of reliable business partners to collaborate for  timely completion of our projects.
The current time is  unprecedented in terms of Government support  environment.
During FY’15 to FY’17, 17 development projects with  total capital investment of over `760,000 million were  approved.
These projects which are under various stages of  execution would enable monetisation of 190 million  tonnes of oil and oil-equivalent gas.
The collective  production from these projects during the year 2020 -2021 is  expected to be 50 % of ONGC’s current oil and gas  production.
These projects include development of  Cluster 2 of the deepwater NELP block KG-DWN 98/2 in  India’s East coast at an investment of over-USD 5 billion  (`340,000 million) largest-ever investment by ONGC in a  single project, aiming at monetisation of 71.36 MMToe of  oil and gas reserves.
During the same period of FY’15 to FY’17, as many as 15  mega projects – 8 brown field and 7 greenfield (re)development  projects – with total investment of `543,727 million were  completed.
The envisaged production from these projects is  expected to be 143 million tonnes of oil and oil-equivalent of  gas.
These projects contributed 19.2% to ONGC’s oil and gas  production during FY’17.
Your Company’s volume growth in the years to come will  largely hinge on timely execution of the projects under  implementation, as well as identification and formulation  of new (re)development projects.
A dedicated project  management office has been put in place, which not only  keeps track of the progress on real time basis in the critical  projects but also flags any potential bottlenecks in  implementation ensuring timely corrective action.
Notwithstanding a difficult market landscape, your  Company remains steadfastly engaged in taking the  country’s energy drive forward for creation of value for all  stakeholders.
Th e  s l o w  r e c o v e ry  in  gl o b al  cru d e  p ri c e s  fr o m  mi d - 20 1 6   translated to a 6.6% rise in our net realization for every  barrel of crude sold.
While revenues from crude sales  inched up by 7%, low domestic gas prices contributed to a  23% reduction in our gas sales value despite 5% increase in  gas sales volume.
Overall, our gross revenues in FY’17 was  `779,078 million, compared to `777,418 million in FY’16.
Our combined group turnover for FY’17 was `1,421,490  million ( `1,356,642 million in FY’16).
Standalone  Profit-After-Tax (PAT) was `179,000 million (up 10.9%)  while the Group PAT was `204,979 million( up 59.2% ).
Standalone profit growth was on account of higher crude  price realization and reduction in exploratory cost  write-off despite lower gas prices, provision for past  royalty expense and provision for pay revision.
The robust  uptick in group profit was driven by strong performances  of both the subsidiaries – overseas business arm ONGC  Videsh and downstream subsidiary MRPL.
Your Company remains one of the strongest performers  in terms of dividend pay-out.
ONGC has consistently  maintained a dividend pay-out ratio of over 45% in 9 of  the last 11 years.
In FY’17, our pay-out ratio was 52%.
In fact, in the past three years, a period when most  global upstream oil companies had to resort to  aggressive cuts in capex and project deferrals to  honour their dividend commitments, your Company  was able to sustain tradition of higher dividends as well as initiate new mega projects ensuring long-term sustainable growth of your Company.
Total dividend distribution for FY’17 stood at `93,430 million, inclusive of dividend distribution tax and final dividend.
Internationally as well, the Company’s business is on a  secure and strong footing.
After a difficult FY’16 with a  loss of `36,401 million, ONGC Videsh – the 100%  subsidiary – made a profit of `6,974 million in FY’17.
Acquisition of 26% stake in Vankorneft resulted in  significant production growth during FY’17.
Overseas  hydrocarbon output stood at 12.8 MMToe compared to  8.92 MMToe during FY’16, with the share of ONGC  Videsh in Venkorneft production at 4.55 MMToe.
Looking ahead, production in current fiscal is expected to  be even higher as full-year of Vankorneft’s production is  counted.
Your Company’s performance in the downstream  segment (refining and petrochemical) in FY’17 has also  been excellent.
MRPL registered its highest-ever crude  throughput at 16.57 MMT.
The refining unit recorded an  impressive GRM of $7.75 per barrel, an improvement of  close to 50% relative to FY’16.
Turnover of refining  operations clocked a 17% growth over FY’16 at `599,891  m i l l i o n .
M R P L ’ s  P A T  s u r g e d  b y  o v e r  5 0 0 %  t o  t h e   highest-ever level of `32,932 million in FY’17 versus  `5,058 million during FY’16.
MRPL continues to be  operationally one of the most efficient PSU refineries in  the country with the capacity to process a wide variety of  crude grades.
The refinery also delivered its highest-ever  d i s t i l l a t e  yi e l d ,  h i g h e s t - e v e r  d i e s e l  p r o d u c t i o n  a s  w e l l  a s   highest-ever LPG production.
MRPL is focused on  expanding its domestic market presence by direct  marketing of its products Petcoke, Sulphur and  Polypropylene.
MRPL is now widening its Polypropylene  product range to penetrate different market segments  thereby securing higher margins.
During the same period, OMPL, a petrochemical venture  of the ONGC group, now a direct subsidiary of MRPL,  achieved highest revenue of `52,566 million with exports  of `37,412 million in FY17, while now operating at 95%  utilization, establishing a niche presence in the  international markets.
All the units at ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL), the  biggest downstream integration projects of the country,  were commissioned during FY’17.
The unit was dedicated  to the nation in March, 2017 by Hon’ble Prime Minister.
The JV entity in the power segment, the 726.6 MW OTPC  Power Plant, the biggest ever energy infrastructure  project in the country’s North-eastern region and located  in the State of Tripura, recorded a net profit of `1,385  million in FY’17, a Six-fold jump over FY’16.
Besides being  the globally biggest UNFCCC-registered CDM project, it  also is India’s first dividend paying stand-alone gas-fuelled  power generation company.
Your Company has always placed a very high importance  on the implementation of new technologies and  innovative methods in its operations.
Advanced and  state-of-the-art technologies like broadband 3D seismic  survey for exploratory efforts in the Western offshore and  under-balanced drilling for some of the development  wells, have been implemented.
T echnology will continue  to play an increasingly critical role for upstream  companies in a post-COP 21 energy scenario that strongly  emphasizes on minimizing carbon emissions, improving  energy efficiency and greater safety of operations.
Towards making ONGC a ‘Carbon-Neutral’ Company,  several initiatives such as ‘Paperless Office’ and  optimising water foot print in operations have been rolled  out.
20% reduction in gas flaring during FY’17 via-a-vis  FY’16, has been achieved.
Your Company has 15  r e gi s t e r e d  C D M  p r o j e c t s  wi th  UNF C C C  wi th  p o t e n ti al   to yield about 2.1 million Certified Emission Reductions  (CER) annually.
In terms of the share of green energy  forms in the energy portfolio, the Company presently has  two operational wind farms with a combined capacity of  153 MW.
We are exploring further opportunities in  renewables.
ONGC is among few Indian corporates to  feature in the Newsweek Global 500 Green Energy  Rankings.
Today, your Company has a steady performance history of  more than 60 year.
Besides its exceptional contribution  towards the national economy and creating value for its  shareholders, even as a Corporate citizen, ONGC has  made enormous contribution.
Its CSR program is a  sterling example of how a corporate creates additional  value for all its stakeholders.
In FY’17, your Company  spent as much as `5,259 million in its CSR initiatives in  the areas of education, health, skill development etc.
Your Company created history with 6 of its employees  successfully climbing the summit of Mount Everest, thus  joining the galaxy of few corporates globally achieving  this feat.
It is one-of-its-kind of employee engagement  initiative taken by ONGC during the FY’17.
The team  members were also felicitated by the Hon’ble Minister of  Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.
Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Government  of India, in particular the administrative ministry –  ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, for its constant  support and encouragement.
Through this message, I also  assure every stakeholder of our whole-hearted  commitment and efforts towards creating a more  self-reliant and vibrant energy ecosystem within the  country, while creating more value for our shareholders.
Last but not the least, I take this opportunity to  acknowledge and appreciate the support of our valued  shareholders.
Your contribution in the form of your belief  and investment in the Company does not need any  elaboration and is valued by us at all times.
At the successful closure of yet another financial year, I thank  you for your invaluable support and guidance.

In the FY’17, ONGC  made 23 Hydrocarbon  discoveries with a total  reserve accretion of  64.54 MT of O+OEG.
The overall 2P Reserve  Replacement Ratio  (RRR) was 1.45 making it  the 11th consecutive year  when ONGC recorded an  RRR in excess of ‘one’!
23 Discoveries Board’s Report Annexure to Board’s Report Comments of C&AG 40 97 144 40 Board’s Report Dear Shareholders, I, on behalf of the Board of Directors of your Company,  am pleased to share with you the achievements and  highlights of your Company during the financial year  ended March 31, 2017 and to present the 24th Annual  Report on the business and operations of Oil and  Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) and its Audited  Financial Statements with the Auditors’ Report and  Comments on the Accounts by the Comptroller and  Auditor General (CAG) of India and the reply of the  management thereto.
The challenges that marked the macro environment,  viz.
low commodity prices, uncertain demand outlook  and slow global economic recovery, in FY’16 persisted  in FY’17 as well.
Crude prices today are distinctly higher  than they were in early 2016.
However, it would be  prudent for oil and gas companies to remain wary as the  recovery has not been as robust and stable as one would  have liked it to be.
It is reflective of the larger economic  environment of the world where secular growth has  not returned to the markets post the global financial  meltdown and the subsequent Eurozone slowdown.
While this extended period of low commodity prices  poses challenges for E&P companies in terms of  ambitious exploratory efforts and development from  difficult areas, it is a source of meaningful monetary  comfort for an import dependent economy likes ours.
That being said, price-related pressures are likely  to ease going forward as companies learn to adapt  and improvise in this ‘new normal’ of low prices.
We  must not forget that our industry has faced numerous  challenges in the past and has always come out stronger  each time.
This ‘new normal’ will also be defined and  influenced by the international political developments  in the past one year and the remarkable growth (both  in terms of investment as well as capacity addition)  of renewable energy sources, adding a further layer of  complexity to the operating environment of oil and gas.
In this prevailing environment of increased volatility and  uncertainty, it has become more important than ever for  companies to sharpen their focus on promising growth  avenues while consolidating their key areas of strength.
For your Company, it meant a more aggressive approach  to cost optimization and operational efficiencies in our  legacy business and stepping up activity in the area of  unmonetized discoveries with comprehensive planning  and robust project management philosophy.
Considering the critical importance of your Company  in the country’s overall energy infrastructure, the  decisions and actions of today will, to a large extent,  not only set the ground for a significant transformation  that will enable it to contribute even more expansively  to the country’s energy sector but also ensure its  competitiveness in any operating environment.
Despite the challenges  of the business and its  surrounding environment,  your Company along with  its group companies has  registered yet another year  of strong performance  and made substantial  progress on most of these  priority areas.
In addition,  performance in the other  areas of business where your Company has significant  interests also recorded important milestones.
Backed by an intensive and continuous exploration  programme, your Company made 23 oil and gas  discoveries in various basins of India out of which eight  discoveries have already been monetized.

Global Economy 2016 could well turn out to be a pivotal year in terms  of effecting significant transformation in the way the  world functions – be it the manner in which sovereign  governments administer, the priorities of policy  formulation and market interventions, the dynamics  of regional and international trade partnerships and  movement of goods and services or the pace of economic  recovery and consolidation in developed markets and  the growth trajectory of emerging economies.
The recovery in crude oil prices from their historic lows  of early 2016 in the latter half of the year was not readily  accompanied by a more enthusiastic outlook on global  trade and investment in the longer term as there is a  vast amount of uncertainty surrounding the potential  implications arising out of the host of developments,  most notably UK’s exit from the European Union  (‘Brexit’) in June and the result of US elections in  November 2016, both signifying a rise in protectionist  and nationalistic tendencies around the world.
In terms of growth, there was a palpable shift in  gears in the second-half of 2016 with buoyancy in  financial markets and a cyclical recovery underway in  manufacturing and trade which supported the global  GDP growth rate at 3.1% (same as 2015).
Further, as  per the latest World Economic Outlook of IMF, growth  is projected to rise from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.5% in 2017  and 3.6% in 2018.
However, this improved outlook is more of a reflection  of economic stabilization subsequent to consecutive  years of stymied economic activity rather than a  legitimate signal of a robust and sustained revival of  global demand.
Concerns on low productivity growth,  increasing income inequality, persistent commodity  market volatility, unflattering demand uptick and  repercussions of China’s transition to a domestic  consumption led and service oriented economy from  a capital intensive manufacturing hub, among others,  will continue to pose interesting questions to sovereign  GDP Growth 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2015 4 4.1 4.5 4.8 3.1 3.1 3.5 3.6 1.9 1.7 2 2 2016 2017 2018 World Advanced Economies Emerging Market and Developing Economies 151 governments, leaders and international multilateral  agencies in their attempt to explore the possibility of  devising an economic roadmap of sustainable growth  creation.
Coming to the performance of the world economy, in  the second-half of 2016, the stronger global momentum  in demand—investment in particular—resulted in  marked improvements in manufacturing and trade,  which were very weak in late 2015 and early 2016.
Production of both consumer durables and capital  goods rebounded in the second-half of 2016.
A number  of factors contributed to these developments: a gradual  global recovery in investment, supported by infrastructure  and real estate investment in China, reduced drag from  adjustment to lower commodity prices, and the end of an  inventory cycle in the United States.
The World growth, estimated as in the October 2016  World Economic Outlook (WEO), at 3.1% in 2016,  is   projected to increase to 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in  2018.
In line with the stronger-than-expected pickup  in growth in advanced economies and weaker-than- expected activity in some emerging market economies  in the latter half of 2016, the forecast for 2017–18  envisions a rebound in activity in advanced economies  that is faster than previously expected, while growth in  2017 is forecast to be marginally weaker in emerging  market and developing economies.
The broad story remains unchanged: over the near and  medium-term, most of the projected pickup in global  growth will stem from stronger activity in emerging  market and developing economies.
The U.S. economy is projected to expand at a faster  pace in 2017 and 2018, with growth forecast at 2.3%  and 2.5%, respectively.
The stronger near-term outlook  reflects the momentum from the second-half of 2016,  driven by a cyclical recovery in inventory accumulation,  solid consumption growth, and the assumption of a  looser fiscal policy stance.
The Euro Area recovery is expected to proceed at a broadly  similar pace in 2017–18 as in 2016.
While growth may  GDP Growth and Forecast: US remains steady; India picks up where China slows (Source: IMF WEO April 2017)10 8 6 4 2 0 -2 (in %) JapanEuro AreaUnited States China India 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Management Discussion and Analysis Report Economic activity in advanced economies  as a group is now forecast to grow by 2.0%  in 2017 and 2018.
The stronger outlook in  advanced economies reflects a projected  cyclical recovery in global manufacturing,  signs of which were already visible at the  end of 2016, and an uptick in confidence,  especially after the U.S. elections, which are  expected to fuel the cyclical momentum.
152 be supported by a mildly expansionary fiscal stance and  a weaker euro, uncertainty looms on the horizon in the  form of electoral outcomes in key member states and the  European Union’s future relationship with the United  Kingdom.
Output in the Euro Area is expected to grow by  1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018.
Growth in the group of emerging market and  developing economies is forecast to rise to 4.5% and  4.8% respectively in 2017 and 2018, from an estimated  outturn of 4.1% in 2016.
Growth in China is projected to register a marginal dip   from 6.7% in 2016 to 6.6% in 2017, slowing to 6.2% in  2018.
It must be noted that China’s growth has bettered  earlier projections and the stronger-than-expected  momentum in 2016 and the anticipation of continued  policy support in the form of strong credit growth  and reliance on public investment should continue to  support the country in near-term.
In India, the growth forecast for 2017 is 7.2% as against a  growth rate of 6.8% in 2016.
As per analysts, the potential  for a more accelerated pace of growth has been curtailed  because of the temporary negative consumption shock  induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions  from the recent currency exchange initiative.
However,  medium-term growth prospects are favourable, with  growth forecast to rise to about 8% over the medium- term due to the implementation of key reforms, loosening  of supply-side bottlenecks, and appropriate fiscal and  monetary policies.
India’s economy has grown at a strong pace in recent years  owing to the implementation of critical structural reforms,  favourable terms of trade, and lower external vulnerabilities.
“Indian Economy Snapshot” The Indian economy is quite uniquely positioned in the context of current global, political and economic realities.
For three years running now the economy has been dubbed by leading global institutions such as the IMF and  the World Bank as ‘one of the few bright spots’ internationally and rightly so – our GDP expansion record in  recent years has put us right at the head of the pack of large economies in terms of growth as well as potential for  future progress.
Our capital markets, among the most developed and efficient in the world, are riding a strong  wave of growth borne out by robust year-on-year increase in FDI inflows (expected to be 15% higher in FY’16- 17 than FY’15-16), and our stock markets are at record high levels.
In fact, FII investments ($8.84 bn) in the  Indian capital market in March hit a record high in about 15 years.
Low commodity prices in global markets  have supported the easing of the Current Account deficit while restraining both retail and wholesale inflation  within manageable limits of 5% to 6%.
Despite a tepid international economy and a temporary demand shock  in the domestic economy due to the ambitious rollout of ‘demonetization’, GDP growth rate for FY’2016-17,  as per figures released by the Central Statistics Office, stood at 7.1%.
Notwithstanding the drop in growth relative to FY’2015-16, the economy’s performance has exceeded the estimates  put forth by analysts and is well stationed for a sustained period of strong economic output, driven by an investor- friendly environment, meaningful policy reforms such as the GST implementation among others, priority focus to  the manufacturing sector, increasing digitalization and use of IT infrastructure and a healthy outlook on domestic  demand and consumption.
In the Union Budget 2017-18, the Finance Minister, Mr. Arun Jaitley, verified that the major push of the budget  proposals is on growth stimulation, providing relief to the middle-class, providing affordable housing, curbing  black money, digitalisation of the economy, enhancing transparency in political funding and simplifying the  tax administration in the country.
National initiatives like Make in India, Digital India and Skill India,  endorsed and championed by none other than the Hon’ble Prime Minister, can be expected to further  reassert the Government’s pro-growth stance while generating substantial employment opportunities for  the youth of the country.
153 The country also benefits from its enviable reserve of soft capital – the vast pool of talented, ambitious and, above all,  young workforce.
T oday, the percentage of youth in the country’s population is among the highest in the world.
While  many Asian countries are aging (Japan most notably), approximately half of India’s 1.2 billion people are under  the age of 26, and by 2020, it is forecast to be the youngest country in the world, with a median age of 29.
That is a  fantastic advantage to have in today’s era of competitiveness.
The Government’s Start-Up India campaign, targeted  at fostering a vibrant ecosystem for entrepreneurial activity within the country, is predicated on the out-of-the-box  thinking, risk-taking appetite and technology-savvy nature of the country’s young population.
In view of the program’s  potential for rejuvenating the domestic economy and its strong relation to the success of other initiatives like Make  in India and Digital India, the Union Cabinet has approved `10,000 crore (US$ 1.53 billion) initial corpus for the  Fund of Funds for Start-ups (FFS) established in June 2016.
The decision to withdraw high denomination currency notes of `1000 and `500, which constituted 85% of the  total value of currency in circulation, in November 2016 is another testament of the Government’s commitment to  bold and disruptive moves for ensuring transparency and long-term durability of the Indian financial markets even  if it entails short-term immediate constraints.
Elimination of black money and the growing menace of fake Indian  currency, aimed through the demonetization exercise, will go a long way in improving the economy’s health and  create avenues of growth.
On the other hand, GST is expected to enhance production, and facilitate easier movement  of goods and services across Indian states.
The tax reform is expected to raise the country’s medium-term growth to  above 8%, as per IMF.
India is expected to be the third largest consumer economy as its consumption may triple to US$ 4 trillion by 2025,  owing to shift in consumer behaviour and expenditure pattern, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG)  report; and is estimated to surpass USA to become the second largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity  (PPP) by the year 2040, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
Our story inspires confidence and  exemplifies resilience in a larger global market that continues to struggle to break free from the lethargic recovery post  the global financial and Eurozone sovereign debt crises, compounded further in the wake of tumultuous events such  as Brexit and shifting political narrative in advanced economies.
However, our GDP growth, even with its impressive  track record, is believed to be below our potential, and the economy, despite a sanguine domestic environment, cannot  entirely insulate itself from the setbacks, especially the larger one, in the global setup.
So, development of a holistic  economic framework and continued policy reforms is the need of the hour.
As per the IMF, beyond the immediate challenge of replacing currency in circulation following the November 2016  currency exchange initiative, policy actions should focus on reducing labour and product market rigidities to ease firm  entry and exit, expand the manufacturing base, and gainfully employ the abundant pool of labour.
Policy actions  should also consolidate the disinflation under way since the collapse in commodity prices through agricultural sector  reforms and infrastructure enhancements to ease supply bottlenecks; boost financial stability through full recognition  of nonperforming loans and raising public sector banks’ capital buffers; and secure the public finances through  continued reduction of poorly targeted subsidies and structural tax reforms, including implementation of the recently  approved nationwide goods and services tax.
Management Discussion and Analysis Report  154 Elsewhere in emerging and developing Asia, growth  is projected to remain robust, even if somewhat lower  than anticipated.
Oil prices are expected to rise to an average of $55 a barrel  in 2017–18, compared with an average of $43 a barrel in  2016.
Nonfuel commodity prices, in particular for metals,  are expected to strengthen in 2017 relative to their 2016  averages as a result of substantial infrastructure spending  in China, expectations of fiscal easing in the United States,  and a general pickup in global demand.
Global economic activity is picking up speed, but  the potential for disappointm ents remains high, and  momentum is unlikely to be sustained in the absence  of efforts by policymakers to implement the right set of  policies and avoid missteps.
One of the most significant results of the globalised  economic world order, especially post World War II, has  been a notable surge in growth in a number of emerging  markets and developing economies.
Richer countries  have continued to grow as well, but with less impressive  income gains over the past 10 years when compared with  previous decades, and certainly when compared with  the more successful emerging markets and developing  economies.
As this process coincided with deepening  global economic integration, the economic model of  free movement of goods and factors of production is  being increasingly questioned as a politically viable  mechanism for delivering broad-based growth and  support for inward-looking protectionist measures and  restrictions on the cross-border movement of people is  gaining ground.
Heightened restrictions on trade and capital flows  would impose broad economic costs, harming  consumers and producers alike, with the potential to  leave all countries worse off if protectionism begets  retaliation.
The challenge will be to preserve the gains  from cross-border economic integration while ramping  up domestic policy efforts to ensure that those gains are  shared more broadly.
As such, for many economies, continued demand support  and well-targeted structural reforms to lift supply potential  and broaden economic opportunities across the skills  spectrum remain key goals.
The precise combination of  priorities differs across individual economies, depending  on their cyclical conditions, structural challenges, and  needs for enhancing resilience.
In the longer term, adequate education, skill building  and retraining, and policies to facilitate reallocation,  such as housing and credit access, will be needed to  attain inclusive and sustainable growth in a context of  continued rapid technological progress and economic  integration.
On the domestic front, policies should support  demand and balance sheet repair where necessary and  feasible; boost productivity through structural reforms,  well-targeted infrastructure spending, and other  supply-friendly fiscal policy measures; and support  those displaced by structural transformations, such as  technological change and globalization.

Global Energy Snapshot Global Energy Basket, Demand and Supply: Global primary energy consumption increased by just  1% in 2016, following growth of 0.9% in 2015 and  1% in 2014.
This compares with the 10-year average  For emerging markets and developing  economies as a group, the decline in  growth between 2011 and 2016 was  2.2% points, with about two-thirds  of this decline attributable to weaker  growth in commodity exporters - the rest  being accounted for by slower growth  in China and in other emerging markets  and developing economies.
Although  commodity price forecasts suggest some  recovery in prices during 2017 and beyond,  the forecast gains are expected to be much  more modest than the losses already  incurred.
This suggests that for many of  these countries, the period ahead will be  one of protracted adjustment—particularly  in those economies in which revenues from  commodities account for an important  fraction of government revenues.

As was the case in 2015, growth was  below average in all regions except Europe & Eurasia.
All  fuels except oil and nuclear power grew at below-average  rates.
Growth in Non-OECD region once again outpaced  that in the developed OECD regions (2.3% versus 1.2%).
While China’s energy demand growth (1.3%) was a pale  shadow of its historical growth average of the past 10 years  (5.3%), it still remained the largest energy growth market  (volume wise) for the 16th consecutive year.
India, spurred  by a strong performance of the domestic economy, growth  in incomes and improved consumer lifestyles, registered  the biggest growth in energy demand among the major  countries at 5.7%.
• Oil remained the world’s leading fuel, accounting  for a third of global energy consumption.
Oil  gained global market share for the second year in  a row, following 15 years of decline from 1999 to  2014.
• World natural gas consumption grew by 63 billion  cubic metres (bcm) or 1.5%, slower than the 10- year average of 2.3%.
• Global coal consumption fell by 53 million tonnes  of oil equivalent (Mtoe), or 1.7%, the second  successive annual decline.

Wind provided  more than half of renewables growth, while solar  energy contributed almost a third.
Oil demand in 2016 increased robustly (1.6 mbpd)  and production growth was by less than a quarter (0.4  mbpd) of that seen in 2015.
As in 2015, this strength  was almost entirely due to oil importers, with both  India (0.3 mbpd) and Europe (0.3 mbpd) posting  unusually strong increases.
Although, growth in China  (0.4 mbpd) and the US (0.1 mbpd) was more subdued.
The strength in oil demand was most pronounced in  consumer-led fuels, such as gasoline, buoyed by low  prices.
In contrast, diesel demand, which was more  exposed to the industrial slowdown, including in the  US and China, declined for the first time since 2009.
Production in the Middle East rose by 1.7 mbpd, driven  by growth in Iran (700,000 bpd), Iraq (400,000 bpd)  and Saudi Arabia (400,000 bpd).
Production outside  the Middle East fell by 1.3 mbpd, with the largest  declines in the US (-400,000 bpd), China (-310,000  bpd) and Nigeria (-280,000 bpd).
Most of the growth in global gas consumption was driven  by a rise in EU gas consumption as it rose sharply by 30  bcm, or 7.1% – the fastest growth since 2010.

(Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2017) Commodity (Energy) Prices: 2016 was a year of resurgence for global commodities  market as prices staged a remarkable recovery after having  endured a tough bearish period for most of 2015 and being  in the doldrums in the early part of 2016.
This was largely  driven by a host of factors – production containment,  buoyancy in market sentiment around investment and  manufacturing that accompanied US election results and  changes in China (policy shifts and increased sourcing),  being among the most prominent influencers.
Management Discussion and Analysis Report World Crude Prices – 5 Year Frame 1-Sep 2012 1-Mar 2012 1-Mar 2013 1-Sep 2013 1-Mar 2014 1-Sep 2014 1-Mar 2015 1-Sep 2015 1-Mar 2016 1-Sep 2016 1-Mar 2017 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 US $ per Barrel Dated Brent OPEC WTI Global Gas Consumption T rend: 2016 Vs 2015 demand growth while demand declined in Russia, Japan and Canada 14.0% 12.0% 10.0% 8.0% 6.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0 -2.0% -4.0% US Russia China Iran Japan Saudi Arab Canada Mexico Germany UAE India Consumption in BCM 779 0.7% -3.0% 8.0% 5.3% -1.9% 4.7% -2.5% 2.8% 9.5% 12.6% 9.6% 391 210 201 111 109 100 90 81 77 50 158 Although demand for crude oil in 2016 continued at a  pace that did not necessitate the drawdowns required  to offset the significant inventory build-up globally,  and in fact has slid from the impressive 1.8 million bpd  growth registered in 2015 to 1.4 million bpd, the same  is projected to rise to 1.7 million bpd in 2017 and 2018  (IHS Short T erm Outlook) on the basis of a marked  improvement in global investment and economic  activity (IMF WEO, April 2017).
At that low ebb for crude prices in early 2016 when a  barrel of oil sold for under $30, with speculation rife  about the possibility of oil plummeting to even below  $20 a barrel, increasing anxiety about the attractiveness  of the sector to the global investor community over the  long-term as well as the continued viability of existing  operations in some of the most prolific and activity-rich  areas such as the North Sea and the US shale gripped  the boardrooms and management discussions of not  just global majors, but NOCs and independents alike.
However, most of the gloomy projections of that period  eventually did not play out and oil prices at the end of  2016 had almost doubled in value to settle above $50/ bbl on the back of another switch in strategy from  OPEC, a drop in US crude oil supplies, strengthening  Chinese demand and supply outages in Nigeria and  Libya.
Despite the strong recovery, oil prices in Q1  2017 are still half of their pre-2015 levels and even  with impressive compliance to planned production  cuts that is being recorded among OPEC and non- OPEC signatories to the deal the possibility of crude  prices breaking out of the $50-$55 a barrel range looks  unlikely in the near-term, at least, in view of the pace of  pickup in drilling activity in US unconventional sector  in response to rising prices and uncertainty about the  continuance of the agreed production control measures.
Natural Gas prices saw a sharp rise in prices through  2016 across regions.
US Henry Hub price registered a  57% increase from $2.27/MMbtu in January 2016 to  $3.57/MMbtu in December 2016 (IHS Markit) on  the back of rising domestic consumption and increase  in new export capacity.
Prices in both UK NBP and  Dutch TTF hubs registered an increase of around 18 to  19% during the year.
OPEC-non-OPEC agreement: In its November 2016 group meeting, OPEC  confounded many as it chose to provide price support  through production cuts, thereby going back on its  2-year old tactic of uncontrolled production among its  group members that targeted to price out the marginal  producers.
Just like its 2014 decision, this too was a  remarkable development as non-OPEC producers,  chiefly Russia, also joined in the proposed agreement,  making it the first such global agreement since 2001, to  in million bpd in US $/bbl 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Jan-16 Feb-16 Mar-16 Apr-16 May-16 Jun-16 Jul-16 Aug-16 Sep-16 Oct-16 Nov-16 Dec-16 Jan-17 Feb-17 Mar-17 OPEC Output US Output Brent 159 curtail world crude supplies to the tune of 1.8 million  bpd in order to hasten the depletion of the huge  inventory builds and bring the market into balance.
While the November 2014 decision to focus more  on market share protection instead of ensuring price  support through supply cuts was indicative of the  increasing threat of surging US crude output to OPEC’s  dominance in international crude markets, the recent  move was more in response to the lack of adequate  drop in global crude supplies despite the bearish  environment and the negative impact on the sovereign  revenues and budgets of producer countries.
During the past two years, OPEC ramped up production  from a level of 30 million bpd in 2014 to around 32.4  million bpd in 2016, reinforcing the group’s enviable  capacity to gush at will just as easily as it throttles output.
Most of this growth was on the back of Saudi Arabia  producing at full tilt, Iraq’s remarkable growth from its  legacy fields and then Iran joining in the party post the  lifting of US-led Western sanctions that had put a cap  on its export volumes.
On the other side of the world,  companies invested in the US tight oil sector, one that  primarily boosted domestic supplies by 4 million bpd  in between 2011 and 2015, endured a difficult period  of operations as hundreds filed for bankruptcy in the  face of mounting losses and serious levels of debt.
Not  surprisingly, the US production growth story stalled  and output dropped from a high of around 9.6 million  bpd in June 2015 to about 8.5 million bpd towards the  end of 2016.
However, even as the US output dropped by more than a  million barrels during the period, the protracted period of  low prices also ended up severely damaging the finances  and economic state of the OPEC member countries.
Oil  export revenues for the group in 2016 is estimated to  have fallen below $350 bn in 2016, the lowest level in 10  years, from the $750 billion earned in 2014.
While the most recent decision to implement supply  cuts have yielded positive results in the immediate  aftermath, encouraged by a high level of compliance led  by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, with prices up by almost  30% in the first quarter of 2017 from the levels prior  to the decision, it cannot be solely relied upon to steer  prices towards a more stable high zone beyond the  sticky narrow range of $50-$55 per barrel evidenced in  the first-half of 2017.
T o continue to offer support to  prices, OPEC and its 11 al igned non-OPEC countries  on May 25, 2017 agreed to roll over and extend their  production cutbacks to first quarter 2018.
This is largely  because of increasing non-OPEC production, again  led by the efficient and nimble US tight oil industry,  which has played a major role in OECD inventories not  coming down to the five-year average—a key metric  that OPEC has cited.
In fact, with continued growth in active rig counts in  response to the firming up of prices around the $50/ bbl mark, the US tight oil sector has already wiped  out some of the 1.1 million bpd that it had lost in  production in the past 2 years.
It must be noted that  prices have surprisingly weakened subsequent to the  announcement and that reflects the extent of the global  supply overhang.
That the decision to extend the cuts has been taken  even as Iran and Iraq already have announced ambitious  plans to achieve conspicuous growth in production  in the current year is a tell-tale sign of the changing  dynamics with the global crude markets.
With the increasing divergence of interests within the  group and the role of ‘swing’ producer being assumed  by the nimble and shot-cycle US unconventional sector,  we could be entering a period in the global oil markets  where OPEC’s outsized influence on the trajectory of  prices is rationalized even as its coordinated measures  continue to act as a crucial lever to mitigating extremities  in the upstream producers’ community.
Global Investment and Activity in Upstream  Oil and Gas: The extended slump in international crude prices has  severely dented the cashflows and earnings of most  oil and gas companies.
This has induced companies to  execute aggressive cutbacks on investments, especially  capital commitments in complex and expensive  greenfield projects and exploratory expenditures in  frontier areas, and instead focus more on achieving  cost savings through a higher level of capital discipline  and generating greater operational efficiencies.
Many  in the sector have also targeted portfolio high-grading  through strategic asset divestments with a view to  leverage individual core competencies – such as  ConocoPhillips’ strong focus on the North American  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 160 liquid unconventional plays while reducing exposure to  the natural gas markets.
As per an IHS Markit report, during 2014-16, global  E&P spending plummeted from $693 bn in 2014 to  $368 bn by the end of 2016.
Overall, global upstream  capital spend from 2015 out to 2020 has been reduced  by 22% or US$740 billion.
When cuts to conventional  exploration investment are included, the figure  increases to just over US$1 trillion, according to Wood  Mackenzie.
The impact of this pruning in investments was most  severe in the US unconventional segment where more  than half of the cuts have been concentrated.
Russia  also witnessed a significant drop-off in investment,  to the tune of 40%, compounded further by its lack  of access to western financial markets due to the  imposition of sanctions.
Conventional exploration  investment for 2015-2020 is US $300 billion less than  what would have been expected in 2014 while near- term spend on deepwater and ultra-deepwater projects  has dropped US$67 billion (39%) with countries like  Angola and Nigeria the most affected, as per Wood  Mackenzie.
The pressures of the downcycle have also  been felt in the high break-even Canadian oil-sands  sector and the greenfield-LNG sector as low prices  complicate a situation that already is burdened with  the worrying prospects of impending oversupply, huge  capex requirements and securing long-term customers.
However, there are regions that have bucked the trend  – especially the Middle East and countries in Asia- Pacific such as India where there is a high proportion of  NOC-spend.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing  high investment levels with 60% of the spend going  toward drilling activity while Iran is ramping up its  pace.
While in India, a country that relies on imports  for most of its energy requirements, the situation is ripe,  factoring in the prevailing low costs, for making timely  investments in the domestic upstream sector through  ambitious exploratory programs to augment underlying  hydrocarbon resource potential and implementation of  promising greenfield projects with robust production  profiles (such as ONGC’s offshore KG-DWN-98/2  and Daman Development projects) to mitigate the  extent of its reliance on imported oil.
One of the positive after-effects of the oil price slump  is the drop in overall cost levels for a company’s  operations on account of the inevitable rate reductions  offered by the service sector and internal productivity  and efficiency gains.
As per various estimates, the level  of cost deflation in the sector in this low-priced market  has been anywhere between 30%-50% with the most  amount of gains manifest in the US unconventional  E&P Spending Plummets by 46% during 2014-16800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 489 595 662 694 693 503 368 in US $ Billion 161 sector – not surprising, considering it has been the  segment that has borne the brunt of this period’s  abrasions as well is the most entrepreneurial and  innovative with ready access to technology as well as  capital markets.
The liquids break-even average has  fallen by about 25% from $65/bbl in 2014 to $49/bbl  in 2016.
Even as cost re-inflation is underway with the  strengthening of upstream activity and firming up of  prices above $50 a barrel, there are areas in Permian  and Eagle Ford that could still see well costs more than  double and yet break-even at under $55.
There are signs of advances being made in the  deepwater arena too as key project approvals in the area  in late-2016 and early-2017 in US Gulf of Mexico (BP’s  Mad Dog Phase II) and the Mediterranean Sea (Noble  Energy’s Leviathan) show.
Wood Mackenzie estimates  global deepwater project costs have fallen more than  20% since 2014.
Continued viability of deepwater  projects is hugely critical for the sector – not only in  view of its future resource potential but also as offshore  oil still accounts for about 30% of global oil output.
Although it is still not clear how much of the internal cost  savings are structural in nature, companies have taken  to adapting to the situation with an aim to becoming  more resilient through structural changes and ready for  expansion when the cycle turns on the basis of a more  sustainable and reasonable cost approach.
Now, after 2 consecutive years of dampened E&P activity,  upstream sentiment around the sector’s growth prospects  in 2017 appears more upbeat, spurred by the meaningful  recovery in oil and gas prices, although downside risks still  persists, anticipated pickup in global demand and newly  discovered cost and operational efficiencies.
As per Wood Mackenzie, cumulative capital budgets  for companies are15% more in 2017 relative to 2016  with a 5% projected rise in global production.
IHS  Markit notes North America will lead gains in 2017,  but spending will remain well below half of what it was  prior to the collapse in 2015-16.
Exploration which dropped by over 60% from 2014  to $40 bn in 2016 is unlikely to register any rise in its  outlay and, at best, may match 2016’s spend.
On the  bright side, lower costs mean well counts may hold  up close to 2016 numbers.
With exploration budgets  stretched, the mantra is now to drill simpler wells.
Hard-to-reach reservoirs, difficult logistics and nice- to-have data gathering are out.
Exploration is the bread  and butter of the upstream segment and the strength of  exploration activity is a reliable marker of the sector’s  long-term health and attractiveness.
A robust recovery  in exploration spend in the next few years is  imperative  for securing the pipeline of future supplies in a sector  that has already given up on close to 4 MMboed of new  supplies by 2021 owing to project cancellations and  capex cutbacks.
Management Discussion and Analysis Report Conventional Exploration Spend 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 250 200 150 100 50 0 E&A Spend Brent Exploration and Appreaisal Spend (US $ bn) 66.1 79.5 73.7 111.2 85.0 111.6 93.5 108.8 95.0 99.0 63.0 52.9 41.0 43.7 Brent Price (US$ per barrel) 162 US Shale: The current era of global oil and gas business may well  have already been defined by the amazing dynamics of  the US unconventional sector – be it tight oil or shale  gas.
The sector that was instrumental in bolstering  US crude production from around 5.5 million bpd in  2011 to over 9.5 million bpd by the middle of 2015  and transformed the country into a net gas exporter is a  story very few would have dreamt of let alone predicted  a decade back when discussions around ‘peak oil’ was  nearing fever-pitch.
Even as the sector endured an extended period of low  oil prices compounded further by the free-wheeling  supplies from OPEC, it continued to discover newer  ways to generate cost savings and improve operating  efficiencies with the resultant positive impact on overall  productivity and commercial viability of the fields  already in production reflected in the declining break- even costs across the board.
From less than 1 million bpd in 2010, tight oil  production increased to around 5 million bpd in 2016.
While more than 100 shale-focused companies in the  US have gone bankrupt since the start of 2015, the  companies that survived have reshaped themselves into  fitter, leaner and faster versions that can thrive with oil  at $50 a barrel.
US tight oil production, aided by lower  costs per well made possible through drop in service  costs as well as focused and innovative application of  technology, and continued rise in active rig count in the  vastly improved current price environment relative to  the sub-$30/bbl depths of early 2016, was already up  by 500,000-550,000 bpd in April 2017.
As per a report  from BofA, US shale oil growth is projected at 240,000  bpd through the period 2017-22 at benchmark WTI  crude at $50/bbl.
As per Wood Mackenzie Research, tight oil plays with  average break-evens of US$47/bbl dominate new sources  of supply, contributing 7 million bpd of the 13 million  bpd needed to meet global oil demand by 2025.
Another  2 million bpd become commercial $60 oil.
On the other  hand, conventional pre-FID projects contribute another 4  million bpd but are much higher on the cost curve with  break-evens averaging US$60-65/bbl.
This has essentially transformed the US onland  unconventional space into a hotbed of M&A and  investment activity.
IHS Markit Research estimates  Permian Basin spending alone is set to increase from  $8bn in 2016 to over $41bn in 2021, a 38% CAGR;  the total Lower 48 (L48) onshore will grow at a 27%  CAGR.
More importantly, the US unconventional  space which was populated and driven by activity  of the independents and midsize players has begun  to attract substantial interest from ‘Big Oil’ with the  likes of ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron consolidating  their presence in the area with big-ticket purchases.
Considering the financial heft that insulates the large  companies from opex constraints during a downturn,  particularly pertaining to sustaining performance in  more promising areas, and operational depth of these  players that facilitates faster application of innovative  techniques and technologies across a wider portfolio,  further cost reductions and growth in output can be  expected from the shale business.
Global Gas and LNG: Last year marked a period of transition for the global  gas market, as players continued to navigate between  the tightness of the post-Fukushima years and an  emerging period of oversupply.
The long-awaited LNG  supply buildup started in earnest—net imports in  2016 increased by 7% year-on-year, reaching an annual  figure of about 265 Mmtpa.
This marked the return to a  robust pace experienced before 2011, as per the Annual  Report of International Group of Liquefied Natural  Gas Importers.
Primarily driven by new Australian volumes, additional  supply was not as abundant as expected due to  production delays, slower ramp-ups and lower exports  from historical suppliers.
Spot LNG prices in 2016  dropped significantly in summer, only to experience  a spike later, especially in Asian markets, due to a  combination of factors—including unscheduled  liquefaction outages, cold weather in East Asia and  Most of the supply was absorbed by  increased demand in China, India and the  Middle East.
In contrast, demand in mature  importing markets such as Japan, South  Korea and Europe remained sluggish.
163 Europe, and reduced French nuclear availability.
However, looking forward, with Australian projects  ramping-up and new trains from the US progressively  coming online, the global LNG market could become  oversupplied until the mid-2020s.
At the end of 2016, as per the Annual Report of  GIIGNL, there were a total of 39 importing countries,  with 73% demand concentrated in Asia, and 19  exporting countries, with 30% of the volumes sourced  from Qatar.
The rise in spot trades (estimated at around  47 MMT last year, up from a share of 15% or 37 MMT  in 2015) and demand for greater flexibility in contracts  with no destination clauses are key trends that emerged  during the year.
Global M&A: The global upstream Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)  activity rebounded in 2016, after a lacklustre 2015.
Asset  deal value nearly doubled, to over $70 billion, and total  worldwide transaction value topped $140 billion.
Corporate  deal flow remained generally subdued (IHS Markit) and  languished near a 20-year low, reflecting more expensive  valuations of oil stocks relative to the price of crude.
While deal activity climbed towards recent historical  average, headwinds do remain in the sector.
Uncertainty  over the stability of high prices in the longer term and the  quality of the assets up for sale in the market (more than  half the opportunities under $1 billion have been on the  market more than a year) are questions that every buyer  Management Discussion and Analysis Report in US $ Billion Asset Deals Rebound, while Corporate Deals Lag 2015 Corporate Deal V alue was Boosted by Shell-BG 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Asset Deal Value Corporate Deal Value T otal deal Count 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Q1 2016 Q2 2016 Q3 2016 Q4 2016 Q1 2017 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 US $/MMbtu US Henry Hub Japan LNG UK NBP India LNG Pipeline NW Europe Asia Spot 164 will have to contend with before progressing on a deal.
Over 80% of the deals (on value) were concentrated  in North America and Russia, with the US onshore  unconventional sector attracting the most activity where  Permian was the hottest play.
While Chinese NOCs, a  prominent presence on the scene prior to 2014, continued  to avoid overseas acquisitions, Indian companies ramped  up deal-making activity, particularly in Russia.
Fiscal Rules: In an environment beset with low oil and gas prices  and a restricted appetite for aggressive plans and  investments, the role of governments and their approach  to policymaking has become increasingly critical  determinants of the sector’s ability to excite investors as  well inspiring confidence about its future.
We are well  past the days when coal, oil and gas were synonymous  with energy markets.
T oday, oil and gas has to vie for  investor money not just with old king coal but also with  the emerging growth areas of renewable and alternative  energy as well as innovative interventions in the power  sector.
Uncompetitive regimes will have to make way  for more attractive models to attract participation from  a wider set of players.
Wood Mackenzie notes that clear-cut candidates for  fiscal adjustments are countries where investment  have stalled because of high break-evens, especially  those in deepwater such as Angola.
Getting the risk- reward balance right will be a critical factor in attracting  scarce investment capture in 2017, even for resource- rich hotspots such as Iran and Mexico.
While low-risk,  low-cost, high-discovered resource opportunities like  Iran may benefit from companies willing to bid high  government-shares, elsewhere, fiscal incentives will be  needed to attract scarce investment capital.
Renewables and Alternatives: The oil and gas sector is moving towards a future that  is arguably more intriguing and unpredictable than  ever.
One of the primary sources of this heightened  uncertainty and insecurity on the future of E&P  business, in terms of its scope and size, stems from the  monumental growth of renewable energy forms, one  that could force fundamental and structural changes  within the energy ecosystem.
Unthreatening murmurs of the world warming up to  the idea of a renewable energy motored universe in  a distant future from just a decade ago has now been  The incredible pace of growth registered by the renewable energy sector in the past 5 years  was characterised by robust ramp-up in investments and speed of technological innovation.
165 in US $ Billion Global New Renewable Investment Global Investments in Renewables Jumped from level of $46 bn in 2005 to $286 bn in 2015250 200 150 100 50 0 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Developed Developing Management Discussion and Analysis Report swiftly replaced with almost routine and deliberate  discussions in the boardrooms of conventional oil and  gas companies on ways to remain relevant to the world’s  energy requirements through possible integration  and expansion of renewable or alternative energy  investments in companies’ portfolios.
The incredible pace of growth registered by  the renewable energy sector in the past 5 years  characterised by robust ramp-up in investments, speed  of technological innovation, a faster than expected rate  of adoption of new energy solutions by consumers and  support extended to the sector by host governments  have essentially facilitated this critical shift within the  energy domain.
The shift in momentum has gathered  further pace subsequent to the historic COP 21  agreement in Paris in late 2015 that targets to reduce  global temperature rise to well below a 2 degree rise from  pre-industrial levels based on nationally determined  climate change goals.
The UNFCCC brokered COP 21  agreement came into force on November 4, 2016.
As per a report from UNEP-BNEF in 2015, renewable  energy set new records for investment and new capacity  added.
Investments reached nearly $286 billion, more  than six times than in 2004, and for the first time,  more than half of all added power generation capacity  came from renewables.
That the sector’s growth in  investments has taken place even through a period of  low oil and gas prices, one that has historically protected  the competitive position of fossil fuel generation,  is truly significant.
Global investment in renewable  power capacity (excluding hydro), at $265.8 billion, was  more than double dollar allocations to new coal and gas  generation, which was an estimated $130 billion in 2015.
Overall, renewables excluding large hydro made up 53.6%  of the gigawatt capacity of all technologies installed in  2015, the first time it has represented a majority.
In another boost to its credentials, investment in the  sector was higher in the developing economies ($156  bn) than that in the advanced economies ($130 bn).
Solar PV costs – now half of what they were in 2010 –  could fall by another 60% over the next decade.
Utility- scale projects are economically competitive with new  fossil fuel generation, and solar PV is competing without  financial support even in regions with abundant fossil  fuel resources (IRENA, 2016).
Developments in storage technology and disruption in  the mobility segment through rapid growth of electric  vehicles are other key emerging trends that could  radically alter the energy landscape of the future with  serious implications for the nature of business in the oil  and gas sector.
Despite the impressive trend of growth, the sector is not  without its set of challenges.
Questions surrounding  intermittency of renewable-energy based supply still  persists.
Another crucial question that will have to be  answered by policymakers worldwide is the resultant  166 views on the US-engineered nuclear deal with Iran are  other issues with potentially significant geopolitical  consequences.
Among other geopolitically consequential stress-points  the denouement of which can critically impact the  oil and gas markets are -  the internal tensions among  OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia and Iran,  in a low-price market; Europe’s strategy in response  to the continent’s growing dependence on Russian oil  and gas imports in a period when Russian ambitions  are on the ascendancy; Turkey’s role in the transit of  Mediterranean gas and security situation in places like  Nigeria, Libya and Syria.

India Energy Snapshot T oday, India is a bastion of strong economic growth.
Our  story is one of the few rare ones, in an otherwise subdued  surroundings, that has escaped uncertainty during a  period of increased volatility in global energy markets  and has so far, successfully evaded the contagion of  continuing sluggishness in the international economic  landscape.
Right now, we are the fastest growing major  economy and are set to remain so for the next few years.
Energy is a fundamental input to any country’s economic  goals - periods of healthy economic growth naturally  tend to translate to an impressive uptick in domestic  energy requirements as well.
During the period 2000- 15, India’s primary energy consumption grew at a rate  of 5.45% CAGR versus a world growth rate of 2.27%  CAGR.
Only Asian giant China surpasses this pace of  demand expansion.
However, the growth in China has  visibly slowed down in recent times as it recalibrates its  growth priorities and undertakes fundamental changes,  with implications for its energy demand, as it embraces  a more services-oriented and domestic consumption- led economy instead of the manufacturing-intensive  and export-driven economy that it has been so far.
On the contrary, India’s outlook for energy demand  growth is decidedly bullish and the economy, as  mentioned already, on the basis of strong fundamentals  and substantial underlying demand potential, is not  expected to experience any such slowdown.
IEA posits  the country is well positioned to be the global hub of  energy demand creation for the next two decades.
In this context, factoring in the country’s per capita  energy consumption and its level of industrialisation  impact on investments once the incentives that are  currently in place to support the growth of the sector are  withdrawn.
Geopolitics: Although the overriding influence of geopolitics on the  trajectory of global crude prices has waned perceptibly  in recent times, apart from providing an occasional  spike in a largely bearish market, ramification of any  unwelcome change or disruption in the international  geopolitical landscape always is a reason for concern for  the global oil and gas leaders.
Most notably, the election of Donald T rump as the   country’s President has made US, not otherwise  reckoned as a source of geopolitical unpredictability,  has added a whole new level of  brand-new approach to  policymaking and trade partnerships which signifies a  clear break from the past.
The US President’s views on climate change are in  complete contrast to that of his predecessor Barack  Obama who was widely viewed as one of the leading  global voices in the fight against climate change  and among the principal motive forces behind the  success of the COP 21 agreement in 2015.
President  T rump’s announcement in June this year signalling  the US administration’s firm commitment to  withdraw US participation from the Paris Agreement  further reinforces his conservative stance on climate  change, which stands in stark contrast to not just his  predecessor but most global leaders.
The move can  be deemed hugely significant in terms of its potential  impact on the momentum, direction as well as ensuring  compliance levels among countries, eventually  determinant of the Pact’s success in implementation of  its goals.
Besides climate change, T rump’s protectionist  stance on economic matters and openly unfavourable  167 as pipeline networks and LNG regas facilities as well  as motivate domestic oil and gas operators to step-up  exploratory and development activity.
BP’s most recent energy outlook to 2035 corroborates this  robust outlook of energy demand growth for the country.
It  estimates total energy requirement in the country to shoot to  over 1600 MMtoe in 2035 from around 700 MMtoe in 2015  at a CAGR of close to 4.2%.India’s demand growth (+129%),  is more than double the non-OECD average of 52% and also  outpaces each of the BRIC countries as China (+47%), Brazil  (+41%), and Russia (+2%), all expand slower.
However,  evolution of the fuel mix still remains a gradual affair, with  fossil fuels continuing to account for more than 85% (from  over 90% currently) of the energy basket.
While three years of low global crude prices have provided  relief to the government as well as upstream players through  a reduction in both forex outgo due to imports and the  subsidy liability on account of the under-recoveries, a global  price recovery has the capacity to quickly nullify the gains  made in the interim.
Moreover, a lack of long-term clarity  around subsidy-sharing mechanism further complicates the  situation for upstream NOCs like ONGC.
Our dependence  on crude imports, currently at around 80% of our domestic  requirements, is projected to touch 90% in the absence of any  meaningful interventions, as per IEA.
In view of the disturbing implications of such a scenario,  the Hon’ble Prime Minister has set a target to achieve  10% reduction in our hydrocarbon imports by 2022.
The  declaration, effectively, serves and will continue to act as  a strong motivating agent in the plans and actions of the  country’s energy firms, particularly its oil and gas companies.
As per the inaugural report of the committee steering a  5-pronged strategy was spelled out - (i) Increasing domestic  production (ii) Enhancing energy efficiency and conservation  (iii) Demand substitution (iv) Promoting alternate fuels/ renewables and (v) Refinery process improvement.
The need for augmentation in production of domestic  oil and gas then is greater than ever.
In this scenario,  ONGC’s role will be one of critical importance.
As the  country’s flagship energy explorer and leading oil and  gas producer, accounting for over 70% of domestic oil  and gas supplies, the Company, despite the persistent  market uncertainty and price fluctuations, remains  firmly committed to pursuing the opportunities in the  domestic oil and gas landscape.
Not only is the country  the world’s largest demand hub for the foreseeable future,  prospects of E&P activity in our sedimentary basins also  appear quite promising.
Management Discussion and Analysis Report and urbanization, energy, its production as well as  availability, will be a key determinant in how India  manages to pursue its development goals as our demand  trajectory, especially in recent times, already exhibits a  trend of robust growth and can be said to have even  exceeded projections.
Moreover, the Government of India, in the  past 3 years, has taken a special interest in   expanding the domestic manufacturing  and industrial setup.
Economists agree  that economic growth on the back of  manufacturing-led activity in any country,  particularly in India with its significant  demand potential and huge opportunities  for employment generation, has a cascading  impact on the country’s energy requirements.
Programs like the ambitious ‘Make in India’   and ‘Smart Cities’ is a step in that direction.
India’s energy basket largely remains conventional fossil  fuel based.
Coal continues to be the dominant resource  in the country’s energy basket with a share of close to  57%.
During FY’17, our liquids consumption grew by  5.17% over the previous year (FY’16).
Although the  uptick represents a marked deceleration from the growth  registered in FY’16, which was over 10%, in the aftermath  of steep fall in crude prices, it still is impressive with no  projection of curtailment in consumption even if prices  firm up at higher levels.
In fact, IEA predicts a robust rise  in our oil consumption – touching the 10 million bpd by  2040 from current levels of 4 million bpd, an increase of 6  million bpd and the largest projected for any country.
Natural Gas which today accounts for just about 7% of the  country’s energy basket is expected to play an increasingly  significant role in catering to the domestic energy  requirements, especially in the aftermath of COP 21  agreement.
Not only it is the cleanest of the conventional  fossil fuels, its resource base is also substantial as our  promising deepwater gas finds in off the country’s east  coast prove.
The objective to increase gas’ share to 15%  in the next few years is an important goal in the national  context – it will foster infrastructure development such  168 Notwithstanding the limited proven potential of our  resource base, the basins are still relatively under- explored and therein lies the possibility of major  surprises as exploratory activity is stepped up.
Of the  26 sedimentary basins in the country covering an area  of 3.14 million sq.
km, 48% area is yet to be explored.
These sedimentary basins have prognosticated  resources of 28,000 MMT (million metric tonnes).
Out  of this only 39% have been converted to inplace reserves  through intensive exploration and development.
In this  context, ONGC is already leading programs to reassess  the country’s hydrocarbon potential as well as bring  more and more areas under exploratory coverage.
What further allows for a positive outlook on the sector  is the positive role of the Government in facilitating  a conducive business and operating environment.
A progressive policy framework has been put in  place – striking a right balance between regulatory  requirements and fiscal incentives, one that is geared  to foster an enhanced level of activity and long-term  capital commitment.
Recent initiatives by the government to revive  the sector • Marketing and pricing freedom for undeveloped  deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure /  high temperature fields which are not onstream as  of 1 January 2016.
The pricing freedom is subject  to a ceiling indexed to the landed cost of imported  alternate fuels.
• Starting 2017, blocks to be awarded under  Hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy  (HELP) under revenue sharing terms with full  marketing and pricing freedom for oil and natural  gas.
Blocks will be awarded via an open acreage  licensing policy (OALP), and licenses will allow  exploitation of conventionals and unconventionals  within the same acreage.
• A contract extension policy for 28 fields awarded  under the discovered fields bid rounds which will raise  the royalty and cess rates during the extension period  and also the government’s share of profit petroleum.
• Marketing and pricing freedom for CBM producers All these can be construed as a statement of the  Government’s intent and a testament to its accommodative  and enabling approach, particularly in respect of  monetizing the domestic gas reserves.
Institutionalization  of a stable, predictable and remunerative policy and  fiscal regime has provided much needed support to the  operators to achieve the desired level of activity.
The  supportive policy framework will also hasten achievement  of the Prime Minister’s target of reducing 10% import  dependence in the sector by 2022.
It may also be noted  that the oil & gas industry is ranked amongst India’s six core  industries and contributes about 15% to the country’s GDP .
Finally, it is ONGC’s strong project pipeline which also  makes the future domestic E&P an exciting area.
In  the past three years, including FY’17, ONGC’s Board has  approved projects worth over `820,000 million which is  remarkable.
These will translate to additional oil and gas  production of close to 190 MMtoe.
This has come at a  time when global energy operators were deferring projects  and imposing significant cutbacks on investment.
While the country’s soaring energy  requirements is a firm indicator of the  economy’s state of health and provides a reason  for cheer in international energy markets,  stagnant domestic supplies, particularly  hydrocarbon production, has resulted in an  ever-widening supply deficit for the country  thereby making reliance on imports a necessary  underlying feature of the Indian growth story.
In the past 10 years, our forex outgo on account  of those imports totalled a staggering $976 bn.

ONGC’s production nomination was 22.22 MMT vs  22.36 MMT in FY’16.
Production from Oil India Ltd and  PSC/JVs was 3.26 MMT and 10.53 MMT respectively.
Natural Gas output also declined from 32.25 billion  cubic metres (BCM) in FY’2015-16 to 31.90 BCM in  FY’2016-17.
Gas production of ONGC and Oil India  increased by 4.3% and 3.5% respectively, compared to the  previous fiscal, whereas that of PSC/JVs decreased by 16.5%.
Consumption of Petroleum Products Consumption of domestic petroleum products  registered a growth of over 5% during FY 2016-17 (194  MMT).
Although the pace of growth did not match  the remarkable expansion in demand (over 10%)  experienced in FY’2015-16, it still represents a robust  trend of consumption given the dampening of demand  in Q3 and Q4 of the fiscal on account of demonetization  exercise.
Consumption of diesel (HSD), fuel with  the most dominant share in the mix, grew by 1.8%,  the slowest in the past 3 years while its overall share  dropped to under 40%.
Despite a slowdown in growth,  the demand outlook for the commercial segment  remains strong on the basis of improvement in medium  and heavy vehicle sales, improved road conditions,  economic viability of public transport and carrier  vehicles due to cheaper fuel commercial vehicle sales  and improvement in road infrastructure has led to this  spurt.
Demand for petrol/MS (+8.8%), LPG (+9.8%)  and Petroleum Coke (+22.2%) grew at a healthy clip.
Rising demand for petrol reflects the steady growth of  the Indian automobile market (+6.8%), especially the  passenger car segment (+8.2%).
On the other hand,  LPG’s strong growth can be accounted by the large  movement of consumption away from kerosene, driven  by the Ujjwala scheme.

After two years  of decline, Petroleum products export increased in  FY’2016-17 by 8.2%, aided by slight pick-up in global  demand as well as higher domestic refining capacity.
Crude oil import bill for FY 2016-17 was `4,705.89  billion (US$ 70.22 billion) against `4,165.79 billion  (US$ 63.97 billion) during FY 2015-16.
Although  import payments are down by over 50% from the peak  of FY’2012-13 ($144.29 bn), they are higher than the  forex outgo during FY’2015-16 owing to the slight  recovery in global crude prices.
171 prices started from August 2014 and recorded a 12-year  low in January 2016 when it dropped to below $30 a  barrel.
However, post the decision of OPEC and non- OPEC countries to exercise production cuts as well as  slowdown in US production, prices have recovered in  the first part of 2017.
The Indian crude basket averaged  $53.47 in Q4 FY’2016-17.
Under-recoveries on Sensitive Products Under-recovery (including DBTL/PMUY/DBTK  subsidy) on sensitive fuels (SKO & LPG) for the  fiscal FY’2016-17 was `227.38 billion; 17.5% lower  than the fiscal FY’2015-16 ( `275.71 billion).
This  was the fourth consecutive year of decline in under- recoveries for OMCs.
From the peak of FY’ 2012- 13, when under-recoveries totalled a mammoth  `1,610 billion, it represents an overall fall of almost  86%).
Reforms initiated by the Government in the  past three years such as decontrol of diesel prices,  introduction of PAHAL scheme and targeted subsidy  payouts in combination with the prolonged period  of subdued crude oil prices in the international  markets were the major contributing factors to this  substantial reduction in under-recoveries.
Out of the total under-recovery of `227.38 billion in  FY’2016-17, the upstream companies shared `NIL  compared to `12.51 billion (4.5%) during FY’2015- 16.
The Government’s contribution has been `227.38  billion (100%) against `263.02 billion (95.4%)  during FY’2015-16; while Oil Marketing Companies  (OMCs) contribution was `NIL compared to 0.18  billion (0.1% of the total in FY’2015-16).
Domestic Gas Prices The revision of domestic gas prices was implemented  by the Government w.e.f.
November 01, 2014.
With  the continuous decline of global crude prices from the  time of implementation of this measure, all subsequent  gas price revisions subsequent to the first instance have  resulted in prices that have trended only lower relative  to the existing price point.
The latest round of revision  to the gas prices, which were implemented w.e.f.
April  01, 2017, pegged domestic gas prices at $2.48 per  mmBtu on a Gross Calorific Value (GCV) basis for the  period April-September 2017.

Some of the key aspects of this new small  field package are uniform license for mining of all  hydrocarbons, no restriction of exploration activity  during contract period, freedom to price oil and gas so  produced in the domestic markets on an arm’s length  basis and no application of cess.
The first round of auctions based on the policy was  launched by the Government on May 25, 2016.
A  total of 46 contract areas comprising of 67 oil and gas  fields distributed across nine sedimentary basins were  offered to prospective bidders.
Results of the bid round  were announced by the upstream regulator Directorate  General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) on February 15,  2017.
Out of a total of 134 bids received for 34 contract  areas, 31 contracts were awarded to four public sector  companies, 17 private firms and a foreign player.
These  contracts consist of 44 fields with estimated in place  volumes of 424 MMBOE.
Peak cumulative production  from the awarded areas is projected at 15,000 bpd  of oil and 2 MMSCMD of gas.

Impact of GST on Upstream Oil and Gas: The implementation of the single system taxation  framework through Goods and Services T ax (GST),  while being hailed as a landmark reform for the domestic  markets with its potential to generate substantial cost  savings, boost productivity and spur investments,  is a mixed bag for the oil and gas industry.
Upstream  business, in particular, is situated unfavourably in terms  of tax liabilities on account of non-uniform treatment  under the GST regime.
T ax-related under-recoveries  could seriously affect its profitability.
While products like kerosene, naphtha and LPG will be  under GST regime, the GST law would not apply for  the time-being on five specified petroleum products  viz.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas, High Speed Diesel (HSD),  Motor Spirit (Petrol), and ATF.
Consequently, the main products of E&P sector viz  Crude Oil & Natural Gas, will continue to attract the  existing levies i.e.
Royalty, OID Cess, NCCD, VAT/ Sales T ax etc.
However, purchase of goods and services  required for exploration and production of Crude Oil  and Natural Gas would attract GST .
Further, exemption  on procurement of select goods through ICB T ender  have been amended to include 5% GST and also  increase in tax on services could lead to substantial  additional tax implication on upstream companies.
Unlike other industries which can take credit for any  taxes paid towards furtherance of business, no credit on  input GST will be available to the oil and gas industry  for the time-being leading to additional tax burden as a  result of stranding of taxes.
Revision of Cess: The sovereign budget of FY 2016-17 carried an  important announcement pertaining to levy of cess  on domestically produced crude oil, especially in the  context of depressed crude prices, and the inherent  volatility of crude markets, which made the imposition  of a flat tariff untenable.
The Finance Minister in the  Budget for 2016-17 effective from March 01, 2016  changed the cess on crude oil to Ad valorem 20% as  compared to `4,500 per ton.
Since, historically OID  Cess has been levied in the range of 8-10% of crude  price and cess incurred by producers is not recoverable  from refineries, representation has been made for  review and revision of OID Cess rate to 8% to 10% of  realized crude oil price.
Operational Performance Oil & Gas production of ONGC Group, including PSC- JVs and from overseas assets for FY’17 has been 61.60  MMtoe (against 57.38 MMtoe during FY’16).
There  were meaningful increments in onland operations and  overseas equity oil and gas output.
Out of the total crude oil production of 33.96 MMT ,  65.5% production came from the ONGC operated  domestic fields, 24.8% from the overseas assets and  balance 9.7% from domestic joint ventures.
As far  as natural gas production is concerned majority of  production (79.9%) came from ONGC operated  domestic fields and of the remaining 15.8% came  from overseas assets and 4.3% from domestic joint  ventures.

Opportunities & Threats  “The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and  the Oil-Age will end long before the world runs  out of oil.
” So said Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani,  former Saudi Arabian oil minister, in an interview  in 2000.
The last 3 years and more in the oil and gas industry  has made many industry veterans and enthusiasts  uncomfortable as they look toward a future of  world energy landscape where the position of  oil and gas may not necessarily be as secure and  dominant as it has been historically.
The future is not just yet as bleak as the Saudi  Minister’s statement would lead us to assume,  as most respected industry outlooks still paint a  future scenario where conventional fossil fuels  176 such as oil and gas continue to easily account for  more than two-thirds of the global energy mix.
But  the future is definitely going to be more complex,  challenging and competitive.
Saying this for an  industry where change and uncertainty is almost  second nature amply reflects the shifts that are  already underway, some of which will inevitably  be fundamental and irreversible.
However, given  the criticality of the industry to the growth  of economies and even success of sovereign  governments, there is sufficient reasonable basis  for oil and gas operators to remain optimistic and  explore promising opportunities with the potential  to yield sustainable long-term growth.
While low oil prices has savaged the balance-sheets  and growth plans of many oil and gas companies  and imperilled the budgets of producer nations  that are predominantly depended on petro-dollars,  the more than halving of world oil prices since a  $114 peak in June 2014 has not proven the boon  to the global economy that many economists had  predicted.
This latest episode of fall in crude oil  prices has been in  the making for  quite some   time  prior to the  tipping  point  and  is  more   systemic  in nature.
Essentially, it is still driven by  demand-supply dynamic – but while oversupply  was the catalyst of the fall, demand is now the more  reliable determinant of the price trajectory.
The  European Central Bank, in one of its notes, states  – “ Assuming that for example, 60% of the oil price  decline since mid-2014 has been supply driven and  the remainder demand driven, the models suggest  that the combined impact of these two shocks  on world activity would be close to zero (or even  slightly negative)” .
Although demand continues to be robust,  particularly among consumers in the emerging  world, such as India the overall situation has been  complicated by a shift towards lower intensity  fossil fuel consumption, which make this episode  different from previous crashes in the 80s and 90s.
The biggest threat arising out of this price crash  is the possibility of supply deficit in 4-5 years’  time as companies scrimp on budgets and  curtail  exploration programs.
The IEA in one of its reports  said that demand and supply trends point to a tight  global oil market and in 2022, spare production  capacity may fall to 14-year low in view of record  two-year investment slump of 2015 and 2016.
However, despite restricted budgets, companies  are showcasing a remarkable capacity to do more  with less.
As per Wood Mackenzie’s production  guidance for the year 2017, companies are focused  on returning to growth.
For companies that had  announced production guidance for 2017, they  expect to produce 942,000 boe/d (5%) more than  they did in 2016.
This shows the opportunity to be  had in terms of sustaining base production profiles  through higher productivity and operational  efficiency, better utilisation of technology and  taking advantage of cost deflation in the service  sector.
Cost deflation has been particularly useful  in the current context.
Cost deflation in the sector  has been anywhere between 10% to 30%, with  areas like deepwater benefitting the most.
This is  reflected in the trend of project break-even costs.
Even, deepwater has shown strong signs of  recovery from the downturn with three major  projects sanctioned in recent times - BP’s Mad Dog  Phase 2 and Shell US’s Kaikias, both in the US Gulf  of Mexico, and Noble Energy’s Leviathan project  offshore Israel in the Mediterranean Sea.
Wood  Mackenzie estimates global deepwater project  costs have fallen more than 20% since 2014.
The  research and consultancy firm also said 5 billion  bbl of pre-sanction deepwater reserves now break- even at $50/boe assuming a hurdle of 15% internal  rate of return.
WoodMac estimates that a further  20% cut in current deepwater costs would bring  15 billion bbl of pre-FID reserves into contention,  which is in line with tight oil.
In addition to the sectoral cost deflation there  is room to further consolidate a project’s cost  profile by way of project optimisation through  redesign, efficiency gains in operations and a more  integrated project management approach.
For  example, BP’s Mad Dog Phase 2 project achieved a  50% reduction in costs through a repeated solution  instead of bespoke and simplified project specs.
These opportunities are internal in nature and  companies that successfully manage these changes  will benefit from a leaner and more sustainable cost- structure, one that can be expected to persist beyond  market cycles.
Overall, global break-even costs have  177 fallen by US$19/bbl to the current weighted average  of US$51/bbl since the peak in 2014.
While it is true the significantly shrunk upstream  capex layouts has affected frontier exploration  and quite a few greenfield projects, it has enabled  more focus and resource allocation on existing  operations as capital is moved towards previously  discovered fields.
As per a Wood Mackenzie report,  these incremental (IOR/EOR) projects will  account for close to US$450 billion of investment  in total and 5.3 million boepd of peak production.
It estimates almost 20%  of new production will  come from incremental  projects between 2017  and 2025.
During this period,  however, the  performance of the US  unconventional sector  will be a source of threat  to oil price recovery.
US  tight oil production is  projected to grow by  nearly 300,000 bpd over  2017, spearheaded by  the Permian Basin, to  an extent offsetting the  effective level of cuts  implemented by the  OPEC.
For ONGC, the challenges that a portfolio which  is predominantly mature poses to its aspirations of  strong future growth is a veritable concern among all  its stakeholders.
Close to 70% of our indigenous crude  production is accounted for by fields with a minimum  vintage of 25 years.
It is a major reason behind the  strong emphasis of redevelopment projects geared  towards realizing higher recoveries from our mature  fields.
In FY’17, one-third of our production was  realized via the incremental supplies of IOR/EOR  projects.
While continuing these projects remains  an operational priority for the Company, the cost  intensive nature of such interventions, especially in  a low oil price regime, is a source of future threat to  sustaining production levels.
The substantial increase in overall energy  requirements projected by various industry  estimates translates to significantly high demands  for oil and natural gas as well.
Such a steep  rise in energy demand as well as our country’s  increasing reliance on energy imports has injected  a greater sense of urgency in the way the Company  approaches new and ongoing projects.
Over the past three financial years (FY’2014-15,  FY’2015-16 and FY’2016-17), ONGC’s Board has  approved projects worth over `820,000 million  which is remarkable.
These  will translate to additional oil  and gas production of close  to 190 MMtoe.
Our Eastern  offshore deepwater project  – Cluster-2 development in  KG-DWN-98/2 block – has  attracted global attention.
Although execution of  deepwater projects has been  a challenge in recent times  because of the technological  complexity as well as the  front-loaded nature of capital  investments, development  of Cluster 2 fields in KG- DWN-98/2 block has  been possible due to the  convergence of a few key  factors like – decrease in  service and hiring costs in the sector, better  understanding of the sub-surface geology, the  Government’s decision to allow premium pricing  for gas developed in difficult areas, and crucially,  the discovery of liquid plays in an area that was  earlier believed to be primarily gas-bearing.
Herein lies the enormous opportunity for all the  stakeholders in the energy sector in India.
Of the  country’s 26 sedimentary basins, only seven are in  Category 1 with proven commerciality and over  two-thirds of the 3.14 million sq.
km of basin area  remains under-explored.
So, although existing  prospectivity and resource potential may not  offer any potential avenue for near-term revenue  generation, possibility of meaningful hydrocarbon  finds cannot be entirely ruled out either as only 12  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 178 btoe of the 27 btoe of prognosticated hydrocarbon  resources has been established so far.
We are also committed to the Hon’ble  Prime Minister’s target of achieving a 10%  reduction in hydrocarbon imports by the  year 2022.
T owards that end, a  strategy  document, derived out of an exhaustive  review of all current operations and future  plans for ONGC owned and operated fields  in keeping with the present production  scenario and as per the predicted/envisaged  profile, has been prepared.
T echnology is another strong opportunity area  for oil and gas operators.
Over the past few  years, companies have consistently extended the  boundaries of frontier exploration and successfully  realized volumes from resources that were hitherto  deemed commercially unviable or geologically  difficult.
The remarkable ‘unconventional’ shale  revolution in North America is a result of those  advances.
Even in the present low oil price regime,  companies that continue to judiciously invest in  upgrading their technological base and improving  their efficiencies in technology application will  remain better positioned than others to weather  the ongoing downturn in prices.
Demand for digital oil-field applications is also  anticipated to grow manifold in the coming years.
T echnology will be a significant enabler in this space.
Opportunities to link multiple platforms operated  remotely from a single onshore center or to deploy  remote monitoring for onshore and offshore operations  can obviate the need for physical on-site inspections.
Not just to tap the next barrel of oil or discover new  hydrocarbon prospects, in a post COP-21 energy  universe, oil and gas companies will also have to rely  hugely on technology to make their operations safer,  more energy-efficient and sustainable.
ONGCians at offshore: Committed to India’s Energy Security 24x7.
179  Risk-avoidance through restricting commitment  in low-impact, low-productivity plays is a viable  strategy in the current price environment as borne  out by the US unconventional oil and gas setup.
As such, E&P companies are likely to explore  opportunities in basins with running room where  geology is better understood and infrastructure  is in place, which both reduce cycle times.
As per  IHS Market report from May 2016, operators  cut back aggressively on low-productivity wells  while focusing more on its richer tiers or plays.
This adequately explains why the drop in US  production while significant (11%-13%) was less  than would be expected from a mere look at the drop  in rig counts (down by almost 70%-75% at its lowest).
This relatively lean period of exploration also  offers the opportunity for geoscientists and  geologists to perform more rigorous analysis  of data and thereby improve the quality of the  prospect pipeline.
The 2010/2011 drilling  moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico region had  a similar effect and arguably led to a stronger  prospect inventory and healthier results in the  past two years.
In fact, from 2000 to 2015, a higher  percentage of annual reserve growth has come via  field growth in discoveries made in earlier years  through better interpretation and understanding  than completely new finds.
A common source of concern among upstream  players in the last 15 years has been the  diminishing size of upstream discoveries.
But as  per a report from IHS Market, smaller fields do  not necessarily mean non-starters – in fact, close  to 20% of fields in the size range of 20 to 500  Mmboe have been producing for over 50 years.
IHS estimates that potentially upwards of 140  bboe remains in existing, low-quality oil fields,  based on a high-level assessment.
And existing  reserves are being continually revised upwards  as new API tools and techniques become  mainstream and are integrated in current models.
Right there, that’s a substantial opportunity for  oil and gas companies.
The Government’s DSF  bid round is a step in that direction.
At a more macro-level, another source of  threat in ongoing depression in global crude  prices is how host governments in resource- rich countries are going to respond in terms of  fiscal and regulatory policies as their revenues  dwindle in the current onslaught.
Break-even  oil prices for the sovereign budgets of many of  the major host countries such as Venezuela and  Russia, with substantial deposits of oil and gas,  are conspicuously higher than current prices.
The fact that many of these countries require  the sustained infusion of foreign investment to  support their domestic business could also be  a hurdle to adopting any aggressive stance in  terms of higher government take.
So, the threat  of dispute with host governments will remain so  long as we are operating in a period where prices  are uncomfortably low.
The current market situation also provides a  fantastic opportunity for companies to review the  business strategy to refocus on what a company can  do best and where it can best outpace competitors.
Instead of broadening the business to pursue every  opportunity, it may be more prudent to develop a  more targeted approach to strategy.
For example,  Apache is emphasizing developing an expertise in  managing late-life assets abandoned by the majors;  for example, it has acquired the 50-year-old Forties  drilling site in the North Sea and intends to extend  its productive life by 20 years.
Globally, the surge in the activity related to  unconventional hydrocarbons has been stymied to  an extent by the steep fall in prices.
Nonetheless,  leading explorers continue to add unconventionals  to their portfolio while keeping their conventional  reserves steady.
It is because of the resource  base’ sizeable potential, shorter cycles, healthy  payback, especially in liquid rich plays, and  operational resilience that makes ‘unconventional’  hydrocarbons a strong opportunity avenue to  explore for oil and gas operators.
As mentioned earlier, one of the most fundamental  threats that is being posed to the oil and gas sector  comes from renewables and alternative energy  forms; in fact, greener energy sources have always  been a constant threat to the carbon-intensive  hydrocarbon industry, however, the potency of  this threat has increased manifold post the COP- 21 agreement in Paris in 2015 and its subsequent  ratification and coming into effect in 2016.
Global  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 180 investment in renewable energy already touched  record levels in 2015 ($286 bn) and the pace is set  to further pick up in the coming years as countries  take steps to reduce the energy intensity of their  economic activities as well as invest in expanding  the share of renewable energy capacities in the  energy mix.
Although US President Donald  T rump’s announcement indicating US withdrawal  from the Paris Agreement is a big setback to the  global goal of mitigating the impact of climate  change and growth of renewable energy, there  already is massive global consensus on the need for  immediate action to address the issue of climate  change among most international leaders and that  eventually temper the ultimate effect of T rump’s  decision on the success of the Paris treaty.
The rapid reduction in renewable energy costs  especially solar power has also played an influential  role in hastening the adoption of renewables.
Average  Global LCOE for solar PV has dropped from $315/ MWh (2009) to $122/MWh (2015).
In Madhya  Pradesh, bids for the 750 MW Rewa Solar Park saw  offers for as low as `2.97/KWh (4-5 cents per KWh)  – compare that with the average of `3.5 to `4 per  KWh for conventional coal based power.
As per  BP Energy Outlook 2035, renewable energy forms  are projected to grow rapidly (6.6% per annum),  causing their share in primary energy to rise from  around 3% today to 9% in 2035.
Possibility of disruption in the mobility space also  is a source of major threat to the future demand of  oil and gas.
The number of electric vehicles (both  plug-in and hybrid) are set to touch 100 mn in  2035 from the current level of around 1.2 million.
Furthermore, India lends itself well to such a  radical transformation given its much-publicized  struggle with soaring air pollution levels in recent  times and the Government has already set the tone  for overhauling domestic road transport - it has set  a sales target of six million electric vehicles by 2020  with an even more ambitious goal of having sales of  new oil-driven vehicles ceasing by 2030.
In such a scenario, oil and gas companies must  link their investment programs to options that are  suitable for a more carbon-constrained operating  environment.
This does not imply radically  transforming the business portfolio through hasty  divestments of legacy assets that are still producing  and profitable and near-complete moving away  from investing in prospective hydrocarbon  properties in exchange in combination with rapid  greening of the business by going heavy on wind or  solar energy.
The need of the hour for every O&G Company will  be to figure out how to produce oil competitively  while reducing its carbon footprint as much as  possible.
Part of the solution is demonstrating a  greater focus on energy efficiency.
Carbon-audits,  CDM projects, capturing fugitive gas emissions  and sustainable water consumption practices are  some of the practices that the industry can effect  that transition to a greener oil and gas ecosystem.
In view of the changing scenarios globally as well  as regionally, it is also an appropriate time for  upstream companies to explore the possibility of  incremental diversification without compromising  the business’ commercial interests and financial  fundamentals or throttling the net contributions  accounted for by the company to the country’s  energy system, as is the case for an NOC like  ONGC.
T alking specifically for India, as already mentioned,  huge potential still lies with Indian oil and gas  explorers and producers.
With more than 28  billion tonnes of prognosticated reserves, Indian  In response, companies will want to  rationalize their expenses and planned  investment, which means it is not merely the  size of the resource base, although that will  remain a major factor, that will determine  where companies choose to make their  commitments.
The delays witnessed in the  development of new oil and gas projects, be  it deepwater or greenfield LNG projects, in  emerging hotspots in the African continent is  an example of that phenomenon.
181 sedimentary basins have good potential.
Only 7  basins are producing (out of 26) and exploration  is yet to be initiated in 11 basins.
This provides  a huge opportunity for all explorers, like your  Company, to convert these remaining basins into  a producible proposition.
Also, in comparison to  the global averages, we also have substantial room  in terms of maximizing recovery from our existing  operations.
Our extensive IOR/EOR programs  address that issue while the 10% import reduction  document, prepared by your Company in line with  the Hon’ble PM’s target, places a strong emphasis  on speedy monetization of the discoveries.
ONGC  remains firmly committed to the continued growth  and development of the upstream arena with the  objective to bolster the  country’s energy security.
In short, in this fourth  year of low prices,  every company in the  O&G industry will be  challenged in a different  way.
Each will have to  rise to the occasion,  repositioning itself based  on what it does well today  as well as on the opportunities that it sees going  forward for although the industry will hardly  disappear, it will certainly look very different 10  years from now.
Y our Company’s performance during this period  beset with heightened market volatility and an  increasing uncertainty about the future of oil and  gas is a source of reassurance and confidence.
Our  profits remain strong and our dividend payouts  have been healthy.
Compared with the widespread  deep cuts in investment across most oil and gas  companies, we have maintained our capex levels  at largely the same levels in the past 3 years.
Most  importantly, our project portfolio looks promising  than ever - envisaged standalone oil and gas  output for the Company is around 70 Mmtoe by  FY’22.
Our diversification efforts have also proved  productive with impressive performance from our  downstream ventures MRPL, OPAL, OMPL as  well as OTPC.
While our exposure to renewable  energy is limited, we are committed to playing a  leading role in helping the Government meet its  COP 21 targets through greater investments in  this sector as well as meaningful in-house energy  efficiency and sustainability measures.
5.
Risks and Concerns  Much of the oil and gas industry has survived an  especially tough past few years with weak demand  and low prices.
It has been difficult to make strategic  decisions and plan for the future.
But prices today  are more than 50% higher than the record lows  registered in early 2016.
Despite the improvement  in the general outlook that stems from the uptick  in prices as well as the capital investment plans of  major companies, a degree of caution still persists  in an industry where the  element of risk never quite  is eliminated from the  management radar of most  oil and gas companies.
The most conspicuous  source of risk for  companies is the trajectory  of global crude prices.
Although prices appear  to be recovering — Brent  crude is up by over 70% from early 2016 to the first  few months of 2017, to just over US$50 per barrel  — they are still well below the $115 per barrel,  the post-recession high-water mark reached in  March 2011.
Continuing price improvements will  probably be slow, and supply may be constrained  by the cutbacks in reserve development projects  over the last few years.
Further, the reaction to  the agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC  countries (esp.
Russia) on production cutbacks has  been less buoyant than anticipated as swift ramp  up in the US unconventional production in an  improved price environment as well as growth in  places like Brazil offsets some of the supply deficit  due to the OPEC decision.
As per US EIA’s May Outlook, OPEC crude  production dropped from 33.08 million bpd in Q4  2016 to 31.92 million bpd in Q1 2017, non-OPEC  liquid supplies which averaged 58.17 million bpd  in 2016 is expected to reach above 59 million bpd  in 2017.
Even as OPEC chose to extend the oil  Management Discussion and Analysis Report  182 production cuts till March 2018, which will take  out 1.8 million bpd of oil from the markets in a  100% compliant scenario, it still does not offer  rock-solid support to a bullish outlook on crude  prices.
The level of compliance, over the period,  will invariably vary among the 21 countries that  are party to the cuts especially among the non- OPEC countries.
Moreover, the exemption of Iran  and Nigeria from the deal makes their production  performance over the deal term a ‘wildcard’ ,  with a greater likelihood of higher production.
This seriously limits the upside potential of  prices even with the production cuts in place.
Global inventory levels are also weighing down  on crude prices.
As per IHS Markit outlook,  production cuts have yet to materially bring down  US crude and OECD total oil stock levels—a  key aim of output restraint.
Through the six- month period of OPEC and non-OPEC producer  agreements, US commercial crude stocks remain  near record levels—and still, of course, well above  their five-year average.
A few years ago, high energy prices were sustained  by a belief that the supply of oil was reaching a peak,  but demand — driven by fast-growing economies  like China and India — would keep rising.
The  trends are shifting, and fast.
Not only does there  seem to be a major new source of oil from shale,  but growth in demand is slowing with the global  pickup in energy efficiency, stagnating demand  from advanced economies and steady growth in  electric (or other alternative fuel) vehicles.
Some of the major projections related to crude  price movements and supply-demand balance in  recent times are presented below:  - The International Energy Agency (IEA) in  its May 2017 Oil Market Report projected a  slowdown in demand growth from 1.6 mbpd  in 2016 to 1.3 mbpd in 2017, remaining on a  decelerating trend compared to 2016 and 2015.
- EIA forecasts Brent prices to average $54/b  in 2017 and $57/b in 2018.
West T exas  Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are  forecast to average $2/b less than Brent prices  in both 2017 and 2018.
- IHS Energy has presented an outlook for  Brent at an average of US$ 55/bbl in 2017 and  US$ 54/bbl in 2018.
The firm expects global  oil demand growth of 1.6 mbpd in 2017 and  1.8 mbpd in 2018.
While the market may not witness any substantial  pickup, the recent oil price gains are likely to persist,  primarily on the back of OPEC’s strong focus on  limiting price dips evidenced by its decision to  extend the cuts upto the first quarter of 2018.
It is  also aided by a projected rise in oil and gas capital  expenditures in 2017 and 2018 as well as the rising  global rig counts in select regions.
While for an import dependent country like ours,  low prices augur well for the country’s finances,  a protracted period of low prices, however, will  tend to disincentivize investment in the sector  which is necessary for improving the country’s  self-sufficiency in terms of domestically produced  hydrocarbon supplies.
Furthermore, maturity  of our basins means that sustaining the base  production itself is a highly capital intensive  activity.
Monetization of most of our more  promising finds in the past few years already face  challenges on account of geological complexity or  remote and unhospitable location.
While fears of ‘peak oil’ were overblown, that the  world is nearing exhaustion of its ‘easy oil’ volumes  is an impending situation on which there is a wider  acceptance within the industry.
Globally, wildcat  exploration is moving into more difficult terrain.
With the steady decline in the number of onshore  discoveries globally, more and more exploratory  endeavours are focused on the offshore arena.
Although, in the wake of the price downturn,  deepwater activity has significantly suffered,  As we look ahead into a more than usual  uncertain period of activity in this domain,  there are some key issues or concerns that  merit recognition as possible sources of  risks and increased unpredictability  within the industry.
183 plans for commercialization.
In this context, the  Government’s intent to fast-tract the process of the  OALP bid round launch is very encouraging.
The  last NELP acreage was awarded in 2010.
As operational complexity rises, safety  becomes a critical element, and a priority  management concern, for oil and gas  companies across the globe.
Many of these  risks – be it spillage, rupture, blowout of  wells, earthquake, tsunami or terrorist  activities etc.
- are being mitigated right  from design stage; however probability  of emergency situations cannot be totally  eliminated.
Nonetheless, ONGC has  implemented improved OISD Standards to  improve contingency combat capabilities.
ONGC offshore assets have been rated  under ‘acceptable risk’ by international  underwriters, enabling a lower-than-peer  insurance premium for these assets.
Another source of risk is the possibility of regulatory  change and scrutiny.
While some of the changes  may refer to the tendency of host governments in  resource rich countries to maximize revenue in a  depressed price environment, others may be about  regulatory actions to restrict hydraulic fracturing,  expand health and safety requirements, and  increase environmental enforcement.
With the  break-even of many pre-FID conventional projects  at $60/bbl, monetization of reserves is already a  huge concern area.
Although production systems  have, to an extent, recalibrated to a lower oil price  environment, a big question-marks hangs over the  ultimate impact of much lower upstream spending  levels during 2015–19.
In a situation that is already  rendered difficult owing to market volatility, policy  flip-flopping could make matters much worse for  E&P players.
Actions taken on the regulatory front  related to other domains of the energy ecosystem,  most notably in renewables and alternative, will  also have a tangible bearing on the risk profile of  the sector.
deepwater or frontier exploration cannot entirely  be avoided if the industry expects to register a  substantial jump in its reserve position in keeping  with the projected demand scenario going forward.
In India, a lot hinges on how we manage to  capitalize on our deepwater discoveries in the KG  offshore area.
Here, the Government’s allowance  of a special pricing structure for gas developed  from such arena (along with ultradeepwater and  HP-HT) has majorly improved the commerciality  of such finds.
Offshore oil and gas has always been  the forte of the domestic hydrocarbon landscape  and the promise of additional growth through  deepwater projects is fantastic news for the  segment.
Exploratory risk in our domestic basins, especially  for ONGC, stems from diminishing acreage area at  our disposal which hugely constrains our capacity  to undertake aggressive exploratory campaigns in  a difficult market.
Our acreage position has come  down from around 4.9 lakh sq.
km in 2012 to 1.5  lakh sq.
km in 2016.
While our overall performance  continues to be impressive, as supported by our  annual reserve position, RRR and discovery  count, the limited size of available acreage has  had a negative impact on the end potential of our  finds as a majority of the finds continue to be  small in size which adversely affects any future  Management Discussion and Analysis Report 184  While headlines of the past few years in the sector  have mostly focused on the US unconventional  story or the low crude oil prices, geopolitics  continues to be a source of risk to oil and gas  operations globally as major shifts and shocks  in the world around the industry do have  ramifications on the dynamics within.
Continuing  supply disruptions in places like Nigeria and Libya,  the menace of IS in some of the most vital oil and  gas hotspots and the impact of growing strain  of nationalism and trade protectionism in the  international stage are some of the leading issues  that are of interest to oil and gas companies around  the world in terms of their impact on the industry.
The current period of low prices has certainly posed  challenges to the operations of your Company,  particularly in respect of complex greenfield as well  as capital intensive IOR/EOR projects in mature  areas and lower realizations from gas sale.
Greater  clarity is also warranted on issues such as the  subsidy sharing mechanism as further erosion of  our profit margins could significantly compromise  future exploratory and development pursuits.
Of  course, being an NOC with a national mandate  for securing energy needs of the country, we are  fully seized of the significance of our sustained  performance in situations of any stripe.
And  ONGC’s performance in the last concluded fiscal  does more than attest its strong fundamentals and  operational excellence.
With increasing digitalization of physical systems  and processes, energy companies also need to be  aware of the emerging cyber-risk quotient in the  environment.
T o that end, it is vital for companies  to identify their “crown jewels” - the assets they  cannot afford to lose.
In addition, it is important  for oil and gas companies to recognize that cyber  security risks do not apply only to corporate  administrative systems, but also industrial control  systems (ICS) such as SCADA networks.
T o  mitigate the attendant risks of increasing level  of connectedness of physical assets to the digital  world, your Company has taken the necessary  steps for ensuring the highest standards of data  security as well as privacy.
We also place a strong  emphasis on strict monitoring of Firewalls and IPs  as well as a strong password policy.
Globally, the ‘big crew change’ has become a  priority concern among the best of companies.
In USA, for example, as per US Department of  Labour estimates, 50% of the oil and gas industry’s  workforce will be eligible for retirement within the  next five to ten years.
In India as well, oil and gas  companies need to deal with this impending crisis  of talent as significant retirements are expected in  the sector by 2020, not only are companies staring  at a loss of significant capital of experience and  expertise with these exits, the fact that they also  have to replenish from a talent pool that is already  quite limited further compounds the situation.
As a company, ONGC too has to surmount this  challenge.
Though it is very difficult to replace  the huge pool of experience that the organization  loses at the time of large-scale retirements, your  Company has taken it as a challenge and has  been taking all-out efforts to address the situation  through redeployment of its manpower and also  through induction of sizeable number of young  executives to take care of the future.

Drilling being our most  water intensive operation, recycling of  drilling mud has effectively reduced our  water consumption.
Waste generated during exploration and  production operations are primarily drilling mud  and mud cuttings (non-hazardous), chemical  sludge and tank bottom sludge (hazardous).
Chemical sludge is collected in lagoons having  leachate collection facility where water is drained  237Business Responsibility Report to reduce the quantity of sludge.
This chemical  sludge is disposed of by land filling in accordance  with norms of the State Pollution Control Board.
T o treat tank bottom sludge, which is mainly  organic in content, bio-remediation techniques  are employed.
Best practices in the oil industry  are adopted to manage solid waste arising from  operations.
Drill mud and cuttings are disposed,  re-used in land filling or sold to authorized vendors  as per industry practices.
Waste management has been identified as a cause  of concern for sustainable development.
Waste  Management Policy of the Company provides for  scientific disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous  waste generated during operations.

The Company  operates twenty-six ETPs to treat the effluent  generated at onshore Installations.
In order to cope  up with enhanced liquid production due to high  water cut because of aging of oil fields, seventeen  new ETPs have been planned to be installed.
At drill sites waste water generated during drilling  activities is collected in a waste pit that lined with  High Density Poly Ethylene Sheets (HDPE).
The  waste water from waste pit is recycled for mud  preparation and other uses.
In North East Sector,  where heavy rainfall takes place, waste water  is treated by mobile ETPs and reused to avoid  overflow of water from waste pits to nearby areas.
In onshore locations, part of treated produced  water is used for water injection into the reservoir  for pressure maintenance; the remaining quantities  are re-injected into sub surface disposal wells  located 1000 mts underground.
In offshore  location, treated produced water is disposed 40  mts below the sea surface.

Independent Auditors’ Report  269 Annexure - 3 to Independent Auditors’ Report (Referred to in paragraph 6 (iii) (f ) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date) Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) T o the Members of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited  (“the Company”) as of 31st March, 2017 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements  of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’ s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the  internal control over financial reporting criteria establ ished by the Company considering the essential components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Thes e responsibilities include the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to t he Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the  prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the  timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting  based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of  Internal Financial Controls and both issued by the Inst itute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethi cal requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls  over  financial reporting included obtaining an  understanding of  internal financial controls over financial reporting,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of t he standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A Company’ s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone Ind AS financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A Company’s internal financial control over  270 financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the tran sactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone Ind AS  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;  and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or  disposition of the Company’ s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone Ind AS financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of  collusion or improper management, override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and  not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future  periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 st March,  2017, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over   Financial  Reporting issued  by the  Institute  of  Chartered Accountants of India.

2.2 In March 2017, Ministry of Corporate Affairs  issued the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017,  notifying amendments to the Ind AS 7  ‘Statement of Cash flows’ and Ind AS 102, ‘Share  - Based Payment’ , which are in accordance with  the recent amendments made by International  Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to IAS  -7, ‘Statement of Cash flows’ and IFRS - 2,  ‘Share - Based Payment’ respectively.
These  amendments are applicable w.e.f.
1st April, 2017  Amendment to Ind AS 7:  The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the  entities to provide disclosures that enable users  of financial statements to evaluate changes  in liabilities arising from financing activities,  including both changes arising from cash flows  and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a  reconciliation between the opening and closing  balances in the balance sheet for liabilities  arising from financing activities, to meet the  disclosure requirement.
Standalone Financial Statements  281 convention on accrual basis in accordance with  the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  applicable in India, applying the Guidance  Note on Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing  Activities (Revised 2013) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India and the  applicable Accounting Standards as prescribed  under the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 read with the Companies (Accounts)  Rules, 2014 (‘Previous GAAP’).
In accordance with Ind AS 101-“First Time  adoption of Indian Accounting Standards”  (Ind AS 101), the Company has presented a  reconciliation of Shareholders’ equity under  Previous GAAP and Ind AS as at March 31, 2016,  and April 1, 2015 and of the Profit after tax as  per Previous GAAP and T otal Comprehensive  Income under Ind AS for the year ended March  31, 2016.
3.2.
Basis of preparation  The Financial Statements have been prepared  on the historical cost convention on accrual  basis except for certain financial instruments  that are measured at fair values at the end of each  reporting period, as explained in the accounting   policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair  value of the consideration given in exchange for  goods and services.
As the operating cycle cannot be identified  in normal course due to the special nature of  industry, the same has been assumed to have  duration of 12 months.
Accordingly, all assets  and liabilities have been classified as current or  non-current as per the Company’s operating  cycle and other criteria set out in Ind AS-1  ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and  Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
The Standalone Financial Statements are  presented in Indian Rupees and all values are  rounded off to the nearest two decimal million  except otherwise stated.
Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to  sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants  at the measurement date under current market  conditions .
The Company categorizes assets and liabilities  measured at fair value into one of three levels  depending on the ability to observe inputs  employed in their measurement which are  described as follows:  (a) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical assets or  liabilities.
(b) Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable,  either directly or indirectly, other than quoted  prices included within level 1 for the asset or  liability.
(c) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for  the asset or liability reflecting significant  modifications to observable related market  data or Company’s assumptions about pricing  by market participants.
3.3.
Investments in subsidiaries, associates  and joint ventures   The Company records the investments in  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at cost  less impairment loss, if any.
When the Company issues financial guarantees  on behalf of subsidiaries, initially it measures  the financial guarantees at their fair values and  subsequently measures at the higher of:  i. the amount of loss allowance determined in  accordance with impairment requirements of  Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’; and   ii.
the amount initially recognized less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in accordance with the principles  of Ind AS 18 ‘Revenue’ .
The Company records the initial fair value of  financial guarantee as deemed investment with  a corresponding liability recorded as deferred  revenue under financial guarantee obligation.
Such deemed investment is added to the  carrying amount of investment in subsidiaries.
Deferred revenue is recognized in theStatement  of Profit and Loss over the remaining period of  282 financial guarantee issued as other income.
On disposal of investment in subsidiary,  associate and joint venture, the difference  between net disposal proceeds and the carrying  amounts (including corresponding value of  dilution in deemed investment) are recognized  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Interest free loans provided to subsidiary  are recognized at fair value on the date of  disbursement and the difference on fair  valuation is recognized as deemed investment  in subsidiary.
Such deemed investment is  added to the carrying amount of investment in  subsidiaries.
Loans are accounted at amortized  cost method using effective interest rate.
If  there is an early repayment of loan made by  the subsidiary, the proportionate amount of  the deemed investment recognized earlier is  adjusted.
3.4.
Interests in joint operations  A joint operation is a joint arrangement  whereby the parties that have joint control of  the arrangement have rights to the assets, and  obligations for the liabilities, relating to the  arrangement.
The Company has Joint Operations in the  nature of Production Sharing Contracts (PSC)  with the Government of India and various body  corporates for exploration, development and  production activities.
The Company’s share in the assets and  liabilities along with attributable income and  expenditure of the Joint Operations is merged  on line by line basis with the similar items in  the Financial Statements of the Company and  adjusted for depreciation, depletion, survey,  dry wells, decommissioning provision,  impairment and sidetracking in accordance  with the accounting policies of the Company.
The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are  taken in proportion to the participating interest  of the Company.
Gain or loss on sale of interest in a block, is  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss,  except that no gain is recognized at the time  of such sale if substantial uncertainty exists  about the recovery of the costs applicable to the  retained interest or if the Company has substantial  obligation for future performance.
The gain in  such situation is treated as recovery of cost related  to that block.
3.5.
Non-current assets held for sale  Non-current assets or disposal groups classified  as held for sale are measured at the lower of  carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are  classified as held for sale if their carrying  amounts will be recovered principally  through a sale transaction rather than through  continuing use.
This condition is regarded as  met only when the sale is highly probable and  the asset or disposal group is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary  for sales of such assets.
Management must  be committed to the sale, which should  be expected to qualify for recognition as a  completed sale within one year from the date  of classification as held for sale, and actions  required to complete the plan of sale should  indicate that it is unlikely that significant  changes to the plan will be made or that the  plan will be withdrawn.
Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible  assets are not depreciated or amortized once  classified as held for sale.
3.6.
Government Grants  Government grants, including non-monetary  grants at fair value, are not recognised until there  is reasonable assurance that the Company will  comply with the conditions attached to them  and that the grants will be received.
Government grants whose primary condition is  that the Company should purchase, construct or  otherwise acquire non-current assets and non- monetary grants are recognised and disclosed as  ‘deferred income’ as non-current liability in the  Balance Sheet and transferred to the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational  basis over the useful lives of the related assets.
Standalone Financial Statements  283 3.7.
Property, Plant and Equipment (other  than Oil and Gas Assets)  Land and buildings held for use in the  production or supply of goods or services,  or for administrative purposes, are stated in  the Balance Sheet at cost less accumulated  depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Freehold land and land under perpetual lease  are not depreciated.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the  course of construction for production, supply  or administrative purposes are carried at cost,  less any recognised impairment loss.
The  cost of an asset comprises its purchase price  or its construction cost (net of applicable  tax credits), any cost directly attributable  to bring the asset into the location and  condition necessary for it to be capable of  operating in the manner intended by the  Management and decommissioning cost as  per note 3.13.
It includes professional fees  and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs  capitalised in accordance with the Company’s  accounting policy.
Such properties are  classified to the appropriate categories of  PPE when completed and ready for intended  use.
Parts of an item of PPE having different  useful lives and significant value and  subsequent expenditure on Property, Plant  and Equipment arising on account of capital  improvement or other factors are accounted  for as separate components.
Expenditure on  dry docking of rigs and vessels are accounted  as component  of relevant assets.
Depreciation of these PPE commences when  the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  (other than freehold la nd, Oil and Gas Assets  and properties under co nstruction) less their  residual values, using the written down value  method (except for components of dry docking  capitalised) over the useful life of PPE as stated  in the Schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013 or based on technical assessment by the  Company.
Estimated useful lives of these assets  are as under: Description Years Building & Bunk Houses 10 to 60 Plant & Machinery 20 to 40 Furniture and Fixtures 3 to 10 Vehicles 3 to 15 Office Equipment 5 to 20  The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed on an annual  basis and if necessary, changes in estimates are  accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation on additions/deletions to  PPE(other than of Oil and Gas Assets) during  the year is provided for on a pro-rata basis with  reference to the date of additions/deletions  except low value items not exceeding `5,000/-  which are fully depreciated at the time of  addition.
Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on  PPE(other than of Oil and Gas Assets) arising  on account of capital improvement or other  factors is provided for prospectively over the  remaining useful life.
Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE  (other than of Oil and Gas Assets) which are  capitalized separately is provided for over the  reassessed useful life.
Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking  of rigs and vessels capitalized as component of  relevant rig/vessels is charged over the dry dock  period on straight line basis.
Depreciation on PPE(other than Oil and Gas  Assets) including support equipment and  facilities used for exploratory/development  drilling is initially capitalised as part of drilling  cost and expensed/depleted as per note no.
3.11.
Depreciation on equipment/assets deployed for  survey activities is charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated  over their expected useful lives on the same  basis as owned assets.
An item of PPEis de-recognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected  to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any  284 gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement  of an item of PPE is determined as the difference  between the net sales proceeds and the carrying  amount of the asset and is recognised as in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.8.
Intangible Assets (i) Intangible assets acquired separately  Intangible assets with finite useful lives that  are acquired separately are carried at cost less  accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised  on a straight-line basis over their estimated  useful lives not exceeding five years from the  date of capitalisation.
The estimated useful life  is reviewed at the end of each reporting period  and the effect of any changes in estimate being  accounted for prospectively.
Intangible assets is derecognised on disposal, or  when no future economic benefits are expected  from use or disposal.
Gains or losses arising  from derecognition of an intangible asset are  determined as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of  the asset, and recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.
(ii) Intangible assets under development -   Exploratory Wells in Progress   All exploration and evaluation costs incurred  in drilling and equipping exploratory and  appraisal wells, are initially capitalized  as Intangible assets under development -  Exploratory Wells in Progress till the time  these are either transferred to Oil and Gas  Assets on completion as per note no.3.11 or  expensed as exploration and evaluation cost  (including allocated depreciation) as and  when determined to be dry or of no further  use, as the case may be.
Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic  test wells are initially capitalized as Intangible  assets under development - Exploratory  Wells in Progress till the time these are either  transferred to Oil and Gas Assets as per note no.
3.11 or expensed as exploration and evaluation  cost (including allocated depreciation) as  when determined to be dry or the Petroleum  Exploration License is surrendered.
Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over  unless it could be reasonably demonstrated  that there are indications of sufficient  quantity of reserves and sufficient progress  has been made in assessing the reserves and  the economic and operating viability of the  project.
All such carried over costs are subject to review  for impairment as per the policy of the Company.
3.9.
Impairment of tangible and intangible  assets  The Company reviews the carrying amount  of its tangible and intangible assets (Oil and  Gas Assets, Development Wells in Progress  (DWIP), and Property, Plant and Equipment  (including Capital Works-in -Progress) of a  “Cash Generating Unit” (CGU) at the end of  each reporting period to determine whether  there is any indication that those assets have  suffered an impairment loss.
If any such  indication exists, the recoverable amount of  the asset is estimated in order to determine the  extent of the impairment loss (if any).
When  it is not possible to estimate the recoverable  amount of an individual asset, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair  value less costs of di sposal and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows are discounted to their present  value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value  of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have  not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than  its carrying amount, the carrying amount of  the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount and impairment  loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit   and Loss.
Standalone Financial Statements  285  An assessment is made at the end of each  reporting period to see if there are any  indications that impairment losses recognized  earlier may no longer exist or may have come  down.
The impairment loss is reversed, if  there has been a change in the estimates  used to determine the asset’s recoverable  amount since the previous impairment  loss was recognized.
If it is so, the carrying  amount of the asset is increased to the lower  of its recoverable amount and the carrying  amount that have been determined, net of  depreciation, had no impairment loss been  recognized for the asset in prior years.
After  a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted  in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised  carrying amount, less any residual value, on a  systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Reversals of Impairment loss are recognized  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Impairment testing during exploratory phase is  carried out at area level when further exploration  activities are not planned in near future or when  sufficient data exists to indicate that although  a development in the specific area is likely to  proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration  asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from  successful development or by sale.
Impairment  loss is reversed subsequently, to the extent that  conditions for impairment are no longer present.
3.10.
Exploration& Evaluation, Development  and Production Costs  (i) Pre-acquisition cost  Expenditure incurred before obtaining the  right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil and  gas are expensed as and when incurred.
(ii) Acquisition cost  Acquisition costs of Oil and Gas Assetsare costs  related to right to acquire mineral interest and  are accounted as follows:- Exploration and development stage  Acquisition cost relating to projects under  exploration or development are initially accounted  as Intangible Assets under development- exploratory wells in progress or Oil & Gas Assets  under development - deve lopment wells in  progress respectively.
Such costs are capitalized  by transferring to Oil and Gas Assets when a well  is ready to commence commercial production.
In case of abandonment/relinquishment  of Intangible Assets under development -  exploratory wells in progress, such costs are  written off.
Production stage  Acquisition costs of producing Oil and Gas  Assets are capitalized as proved property  acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets and  amortized using the unit of production method  over proved reserves of underlying assets.
(iii) Survey cost  Cost of Survey and prospecting activities  conducted in the search of oil and gas are  expensed as exploration cost in the year in  which these are incurred.
(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development -  Development Wells in Progress  All costs relating to Development Wells are  initially capitalized as ‘Development Wells in  Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas Assets’  on “completion” .
(v) Production costs  Production costs include pre-well head and  post-well head expenses including depreciation  and applicable operating costs of support  equipment and facilities.
286 3.11.
Oil and Gas Assets  Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost  less accumulated depletion and impairment  losses.
These are created in respect of an area/ field having proved developed oil and gas  reserves, when the well in the area/field is ready  to commence commercial production.
Cost of temporary occupation of land,  successful exploratory wells, all development  wells (including service wells), allied facilities,  depreciation on support equipment used for  drilling and estimated future decommissioning  costs are capitalised and classified as Oil and  Gas Assets.
Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit  of Production Method” .
The rate of depletion  is computed with reference to an area covered  by individual lease/license/asset/amortization  base by considering the proved developed  reserves and related capital costs incurred  including estimated future decommissioning/ abandonment costs net of salvage value.
Acquisition cost of Oil and Gas Assets is  depleted by considering the proved reserves.
These reserves are estimated annually by the  Reserve Estimates Committee of the Company,  which follows the International Reservoir  Engineering Procedures.
3.12.
Side tracking  In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side- tracking is treated in the same manner as the cost  incurred on a new exploratory well.
The cost of  abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory  wells is expensed as ‘Exploration cost written  off.
’  In the case of development wells, the entire  cost of abandoned portion and side tracking is  capitalized.
In the case of producing wells and service wells,  if the side-tracking results in additional proved  developed oil and gas reserves or increases the  future economic benefits therefrom beyond  previously assessed standard of performance,  the cost incurred on side tracking is capitalised,  whereas the cost of abandoned portion of the  well is depleted in the normal way.
Otherwise,  the cost of side tracking is expensed as ‘Work  over Expenditure.
’ 3.13.
Decommissioning costs  Decommissioning cost includes cost of  restoration.
Provision for decommissioning  costs are recognized when the Company has  a legal or constructive obligation to plug and  abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility  or an item of Property, Plant and Equipment  and to restore the site on which it is located.
The full eventual estimated liability towards  costs relating to dismantling, abandoning  and restoring well sites and allied facilities are  recognized in respective assets when the well  is complete/facilities or Property, Plant and  Equipment are installed.
The amount recognized is the present value of  the estimated future expenditure determined  using existing technology at current prices  and escalated using appropriate inflation rate  till the expected date of decommissioning and  discounted up to the reporting date using the  appropriate risk free discount rate.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning  provision is recognized along with the cost  of exploratory well or Property, Plant and  Equipment.
The decommissioning cost in  respect of dry well is expensed as exploratory  well cost.
Any change in the present value of the estimated  decommissioning expenditure other than the  periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted  to the decommissioning provision and the  corresponding carrying value of the related  asset.
In case reversal of decommissioning  provision exceeds the corresponding carrying  amount of the related asset, the excess amount  is recognized in the Statement of Profit and  Loss.
The unwinding of discount on provision  is charged in the Statement of Profit and Loss as  finance cost.
Provision for decommissioning cost in respect  of assets under Joint Operations is considered as  per participating interest of the Company.
Standalone Financial Statements  287 3.14.
Inventories  Finished goods (other than Sulphur) including  inventories in pipelines/tanks and carbon  credits are valued at cost or net realisable value  whichever is lower.
Cost of finished goods is  determined on absorption costing method.
Sulphur is valued at net realisable value.
The  value of inventories includes excise duty, royalty  (wherever applicable) but excludes cess.
Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group  Gathering Stations (GGS) is valued at cost on  absorption costing method or net realisable  value whichever is lower.
Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines  up to GGS/platform is not valued as the same is  not measurable.
Natural Gas is not valued as it is  not stored.
Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued at  weighted average cost or net realisable value,  whichever is lower.
Provisions are made for  obsolete and non-moving inventories.
Unserviceable and scrap items, when  determined, are valued at estimated net  realisable value.
3.15.
Revenue recognition   Revenue arising from sale of products is  recognized when the significant risks and  rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer,  which is at the point of transfer of custody to  customers, and the amount of revenue can  be measured reliably and it is probable that  the economic benefits associated with the  transaction will flow to the Company.
Revenue from services is recognized when the  outcome of services can be estimated reliably  and it is probable that the economic benefits  associated with rendering of services will flow  to the Company, and the amount of revenue can  be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable and  represents amounts rec eivable for goods and  services provided in the normal course of  business, net of discounts, service tax and sales  tax etc.
Any retrospective revision in prices is  accounted for in the year of such revision.
Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of  levies) produced from Intangible assets under  development – Exploratory Wells in Progress/ Oil and Gas assets under development –  Development Wells in Progress is deducted  from expenditure on such wells.
Revenue in respect of the following is recognized  when there is a reasonable certainty regarding  ultimate collection:  (i) Short lifted quantity of gas  (ii) Surplus from Gas Pool Account  (iii) Interest on delayed realization from customers  (iv) Liquidated damages from contractors/suppliers  As per the Production Sharing Contracts  for extracting the Oil and Gas Reserves with  Government of India, out of the earnings from  the exploitation of reserves after recovery of  cost, a part of the revenue is paid to Government  of India which is called Profit Petroleum is  reduced from the revenue from Sale of Products  as Government of India’s Share in Profit  Petroleum.
Dividend and interest income  Dividend income from investments is recognised  when the shareholder’s right to receive payment  is established.
Interest income from financial assets is  recognised at the effective interest rate method  applicable on initial recognition.
3.16.
Leases  Leases are classified as finance leases whenever  the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the  risks and rewards incidental to the ownership  of an asset to the Company.
All other leases are  classified as operating leases.
288  Land under perpetual lease are accounted as  finance leases which are recognized at upfront  premium paid for the lease and the present value  of the lease rent obligation.
The corresponding  liability is recognised as a finance lease  obligation.
Land under non-perpetual leases are  treated as operating leases.
Operating lease payments for land are recognized  as prepayments and amortised on a straight-line  basis over the term of the lease.
Contingent  rentals, if any, arising under operating leases are  recognised as an expense in the period in which  they are incurred.
3.17.
Foreign Exchange T ransactions  The functional currency of the Company is  Indian Rupees which represents the currency  of the primary economic environment in  which it operates.
T ransactions in currencies other than the  Company’s functional currency (foreign  currencies) are recognised at the rates of  exchange prevailing at the dates of the  transactions.
At the end of each reporting  period, monetary items denominated in  foreign currencies are translated using mean  exchange rate prevailing on the last day of  the reporting period.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the Statement of Profit andLoss in  the period in which they arise.
3.18.
Employee Benefits  Employee benefits include salaries, wages,  provident fund, gratuity, leave encashment  towards un-availed leave, compensated  absences, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits.
All short term employee benefits are recognized  at their undiscounted amount in the accounting  period in which they are incurred.
Defined contribution plans  Employee Benefit under defined contribution  plans comprising provident fund, Post  Retirement benefit scheme, employee pension  scheme-1995, composite social security scheme  etc.
is recognized based on the undiscounted  amount of obligations of the Company to  contribute to the plan.
The same is paid to a  fund administered through a separate trust.
Defined benefit plans  Defined retirement benefit plans comprising of  gratuity, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits, are recognized based on  the present value of defined benefit obligation  which is computed using the projected unit  credit method, with actuarial valuations being  carried out at the end of each annual reporting  period.
These are accounted either as current  employee cost or included in cost of assets as  permitted.
Net interest on the net defined liability is  calculated by applying the discount rate at  the beginning of the period to the net defined  benefit liability or asset and is recognised the  Statement of Profit and Loss except those  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit  plans except for leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences,  comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect  of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable)  and the return on plan assets (excluding net  interest as defined above), are recognised in  other comprehensive income except those   Standalone Financial Statements  289 included in cost of assets as permitted in  the period in which they occur and are not  subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
The Company contributes all ascertained  liabilities with respect to gratuity and un-availed  leave to the ONGC’s Gratuity Fund T rust  (OGFT) and Life Insurance Corporation of  India (LIC), respectively.
Other defined benefit  schemes are unfunded.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in  the Financial Statements represents the actual  deficit or surplus in the Company’s defined  benefit plans.
Any surplus resulting from this  calculation is limited to the present value of  any economic benefits available in the form of  reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Other long term employee benefits  Other long term employee benefit comprises of  leave encashment towards un-availed leave and  compensated absences, these are recognized  based on the present value of defined obligation  which is computed using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried  out at the end of each annual reporting period.
These are accounted either as current employee  cost or included in cost of assets as permitted.
Re-measurements of leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences  are recognized in the Statement of profit and  loss except those included in cost of assets as  permitted in the period in which they occur.
3.19.
Voluntary Retirement Scheme  Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS) is charged to the Statement of Profit and  Loss when incurred.
3.20.
General Administrative Expenses  General administrative expenses which are  directly attributable are allocated to activities  and the balance is charged to Statement of Profit  and Loss.
3.21.
Insurance claims  The Company accounts for insurance claims as under:-   In case of total loss of asset, by transferring either the  carrying cost of the relevant asset or insurance value  (subject to deductibles), whichever is lower under the  head “Claims Recoverable-Insurance” on intimation  to Insurer.
In case insurance claim is less than  carrying cost, the difference is charged to  Statement of Profit and Loss.
In case of partial or other losses, expenditure  incurred/payments made to put such assets back  into use, to meet third party or other liabilities  (less policy deductibles) if any, are accounted for  as “Claims Recoverable-Insurance” .
Insurance  Policy deductibles are expensed in the year the  corresponding expenditure is incurred.
As and when claims are finally received from the  insurer, the difference, if any, between Claims  Recoverable-Insurance and claims received is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.22.
Research and Development Expenditure  Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and  expenses of revenue nature are charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss, as and when incurred.
3.23.
Income T axes  Income tax expense represents the sum of the  current tax and deferred tax.
(i) Current tax  The tax currently payable is based on taxable  profit for the year.
T axable profit differs from  ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the Statement  of Profit and Loss because of items of income  or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and items that are never taxable  or deductible.
The Company’s current tax is  calculated using tax rates and laws that have  been enacted or substantively enacted by the  end of the reporting period.
(ii) Deferred tax  Deferred tax is recognised on temporary  differences between the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements  and the corresponding tax bases used in the  computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax  liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable  temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets  are generally recognised for all deductible  290 temporary differences to the extent that it is  probable that taxable profits will be available  against which those deductible temporary  differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at the end of each reporting period  and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profits will be  available to allow all or part of the deferred tax  asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  period in which the liability is settled or the  asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws)  that have been enacted or substantively enacted  by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would  follow from the manner in which the Company  expects, at the end of the reporting period,  to recover or settle the carrying amount of its  assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum  Alternative T ax (MAT) paid in accordance  with the tax laws in India, which is likely to  give future economic benefits in the form of  availability of set off against future income tax  liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as  deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the  asset can be measured reliably and it is probable  that the future economic benefit associated with  asset will be realised.
(iii) Current and deferred tax expense for the year  Current and deferred tax expenseis recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except when  they relate to items that are recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, in  which case, the current and deferred tax are also  recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity respectively.
3.24.
Borrowing Costs  Borrowing costs specifically identified to the  acquisition or construction of qualifying assets  is capitalized as part of such assets.
A qualifying  asset is one that necessarily takes substantial  period of time to get ready for intended use.
All other borrowing costs are charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.25.
Rig Days Costs  Rig movement costs are booked to the next  location drilled/planned for drilling.
Abnormal  Rig days’ costs are considered as un-allocable  and charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.26.
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets  Provisions are recognised when the Company  has a present obligation (legal or constructive)  as a result of a past event, it is probable that  the Company will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made  of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the  best estimate of the consideration required to  settle the present obligation at the end of the  reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is measured using the cash  flows estimated to settle the present obligation,  its carrying amount is the present value of those  cash flows (when the effect of the time value of  money is material).
Contingent assets are disclosed in the Financial  Statements by way of notes to accounts when an  inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Financial  Statements by way of notes to accounts, unless  possibility of an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefit is remote.
3.27.
Financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are  recognised when Company becomes a party to  the contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are  initially measured at fair value.
T ransaction costs  that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities  (other than financial assets and financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) Standalone Financial Statements  291 are added to or deducted from the fair value  of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as  appropriate, on initial recognition.
T ransaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets or financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.28.
Equity instruments  Equity instruments issued by the Company are  recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct  issue costs.
3.29.
Financial assets (i) Cash and cash equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid  financial instruments, which are readily  convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value  and having original maturities of three months  or less from the date of purchase, to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist  of balances with banks which are unrestricted  for withdrawal and usage.
(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost   Financial assets are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest  method if these financial assets are held within  a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms of the financial asset  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income   Financial assets are measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if these  financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial  assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest  on the principal amount outstanding.
The Company has made an irrevocable election  to present in other comprehensive income  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading.
(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss   Financial assets are measured at fair value  through profit or loss unless it is measured at  amortised cost or at fair value through other  comprehensive income on initial recognition.
(v) Impairment of financial assets   The Company assesses at each balance sheet  date whether a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires  expected credit losses to be measured through  a loss allowance.
The Company recognises  lifetime expected losses for trade receivables that  do not constitute a financing transaction.
For  all other financial assets, expected credit losses  are measured at an amount equal to 12 month  expected credit losses or at an amount equal to  lifetime expected losses, if the credit risk on the  financial asset has increased significantly since  initial recognition.
(vi) Derecognition of financial assets  The Company derecognises a financial asset  when the contractual rights to the cash flows from  the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial  asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety (except for equity instruments  designated as FVTOCI),the difference between  the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of  the consideration received and receivable is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.30.
Financial liabilities  a) Financial guarantee contracts  A financial guarantee contract is a contract that  requires the issuer to make specified payments to  reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a  specified debtor fails to make payments when due  in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the  292 Company are initially measured at their fair  values and, if not designated as at FVTPL, are  subsequently measured at the higher of:  i. the amount of loss allowance determined in  accordance with impairment requirements of  Ind AS 109; and  ii.
the amount initially recognised less, when  appropriate, the cumulative amount of income  recognised in accordance with the principles  of Ind AS 18.
[Refer Note 3.3 for Financial  guarantee issued to subsidiaries]  b) Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities are measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest method.
c) Derecognition of financial liabilities  The Company derecognises financial liabilities  when, and only when, the Company’s  obligations are discharged, cancelled or have  expired.
The difference between the carrying  amount of the financial liability derecognised  and the consideration paid and payable is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.31.
Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share are computed by  dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted  average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per share  is computed by dividing the profit after tax by  the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per  share and also the weighted average number of  equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
3.32.
Cash Flow Statement  Cash flows are reported using the indirect  method, whereby profit after tax is adjusted  for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or  future operating cash receipts or payments and  item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash  flows aresegregated into operating, investing  and financing activities.
3.33.
Segment reporting  Operating segments are identified and reported  taking into account the different risks and  returns, the organization structure and the  internal reporting systems.
3.34.
First-time adoption – mandatory  exceptions and optional exemptions (i) Overall principle:  The Company has prepared the opening  balance sheet as per Ind AS as of April 1, 2015  (‘the transition date’) by recognising all assets  and liabilities whose recognition is required  by Ind AS, not recognising items of assets or  liabilities which are not permitted by Ind AS,  by reclassifying certain items from Previous  GAAP to Ind AS as required under the Ind  AS, and applying Ind AS in the measurement  of recognised assets and liabilities.
However,  this principle is subject to certain mandatory  exceptions and certain optional exemptions  availed by the Company as detailed below.
(ii) Derecognition of financial assets and  financial liabilities  The Company has applied the derecognition  requirements of financial assets and financial  liabilities prospectively for transactions  occurring on or after April 1, 2015 (the  transition date).
(iii) Classification of debt instruments  The Company has determined the classification  of debt instruments in terms of whether they  meet the amortised cost criteria or the fair  value through other comprehensive income  (FVTOCI) criteria based on the facts and  circumstances that existed as of the transition date.
(iv) Impairment of financial assets  The Company has applied the impairment  requirements of Ind AS 109 retrospectively;  however, as permitted by Ind AS 101, it has  used reasonable and supportable information  that is available without undue cost or effort to  determine the credit risk at the date that financial  instruments were initially recognised in order to  compare it with the credit risk at the transition  Standalone Financial Statements  293 date.
Further, the Company has not undertaken  an exhaustive search for information when  determining, at the date of transition to Ind ASs,  whether there have been significant increases in  credit risk since initial recognition, as permitted  by Ind AS 101.
(v) Deemed cost for Property, Plant and  Equipment, Oil and Gas assets and  intangible assets  The Company has elected to continue with the  carrying value of all of its Property, Plant and  Equipment, Oil and Gas assets and intangible  assets recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition  date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and  used that carrying value as its deemed cost as of  the transition date except adjustment related to  decommissioning provisions.
(vi) Determining whether an arrangement  contains a lease  The Company has applied Appendix C of Ind  AS 17 ‘Leases’ for determining whether an  arrangement contains a Lease at the transition  date on the basis of facts and circumstances  existing at that date.
(vii) Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures  and associates  The Company has elected to carry its investments  in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates  at deemed cost being carrying amount under  Previous GAAP on the transition date.
(viii) Equity investments at FVTOCI  The Company has designated investments  in equity shares as at FVTOCI on the basis  of facts and circumstances that existed at the  transition date.
(ix) Decommissioning costs  The Company has availed optional exemption  available with respect to decommissioning  costs included in the Oil and Gas Assets.
Accordingly, the Company has measured the  decommissioning provision in accordance with  Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets’ as at transition date.
The Company has computed the estimate of  the amount that would have been included in  the cost of the related Oil and Gas Assets by  discounting the decommissioning provision  computed at transition date using its best estimate  of the historical risk adjusted discount rate to the  date when the liability first arose.
Thereafter, the  Company has computed depletion/depreciation  on Oil and Gas assets on the aforesaid estimated  amount using the accounting policy mentioned in  Note 3.11 above.
4.
Critical Accounting Judgments,  Assumptions and Key Sources of  Estimation Uncertainty  Inherent in the application of many of the  accounting policies used in preparing the  Financial Statements is the need for Management  to make judgments, estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets  and liabilities, and the reported amounts of  revenues and expenses.
Actual outcomes could  differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the  period in which the estimates are revised and  future periods are affected.
Key source of judgme nts, assumptions and  estimation uncertainty in the preparation of  the Financial Statements which may cause a  material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  year, are in respect of Oil and Gas reserves,  impairment, useful lives of Property, Plant and  Equipment, depletion of oil and gas assets,  decommissioning provision, employee benefit  obligations, impairment, provision for income  tax, measurement of deferred tax assets and  contingent assets and liabilities.
4.1.
Critical judgments in applying accounting  policies  The following are the critical judgements,  apart from those involving estimations (Note  4.2), that the Management have made in the  process of applying the Company’s accounting  policies and that have the significant effect  294 on the amounts recognized in the Financial  Statements.
(a) Determination of functional currency  Currency of the primary economic environment  in which the Company operates (“the functional  currency”) is Indian Rupee ( ` ) in which the  Company primarily generates and expends cash.
Accordingly, the Management has assessed its  functional currency to be Indian Rupee ( `).
(b) Classification of investment   Judgement is required in assessing the level of  control obtained in a transaction to acquire  an interest in another entity; depending upon  the facts and circumstances in each case, the  Company may obtain control, joint control  or significant influence over the entity or  arrangement.
T ransactions which give the  Company control of a business are business  combinations.
If the Company obtains joint  control of an arrangement, judgement is also  required to assess whether the arrangement  is a joint operation or a joint venture.
If the  Company has neither control nor joint control,  it may be in a position to exercise significant  influence over the entity, which is then classified  as an associate.
The Company has 49.36% equity interest in  ONGC Petro Additions Limited (OPAL).
The Company has also subscribed for  1,922 million share warrants on August 25,  2015 entitling the Company to exchange   each warrant with an equity share of  face value of `10 each against which    `9.75 has been paid.
Further the Company has also entered into an  arrangement on July 2, 2016 for backstopping  support towards repayment of principal and  cumulative coupon amount for compulsory  convertible debentures amounting to `56,150  Million and cumulative interest thereon  amounting to `16,570.00 Million issued   by OPAL.
The Management has however evaluated the  interest in OPAL to be in the nature of joint  venture as the shareholder agreement between  all the shareholders provides for sharing of  control of the decisions of relevant activities that  require the unanimous consent of all the parties  sharing control.
(c) Determining whether an arrangement  contain leases and classification of leases  The Company enters into service/hiring  arrangements for various assets/services.
The  determination of lease and classification of the  service/hiring arrangement as a finance lease  or operating lease is based on an assessment  of several factors, including, but not limited  to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at  end of lease term, lessee’s option to purchase  and estimated certainty of exercise of such  option, proportion of lease term to the asset’s  economic life, proportion of present value  of minimum lease payments to fair value of  leased asset and extent of specialized nature  of the leased asset.
(d) Evaluation of indicators for impairment of  Oil and Gas Assets  The evaluation of applicability of indicators  of impairment of assets requires assessment  of external factors (significant decline in  asset’s value, significant changes in the  technological, market, economic or legal  environment, market interest rates etc.)
and internal factors (obsolescence or  physical damage of an asset, poor economic  performance of the asset etc.)
which could  result in significant change in recoverable  amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.
(e) Oil & Gas Accounting  The determination of whether potentially  economic oil and natural gas reserves have been  discovered by an exploration well is usually  made within one year of well completion, but  can take longer, depending on the complexity  of the geological structure.
Exploration wells  that discover potentially economic quantities of  oil and natural gas and are in areas where major  capital expenditure (e.g.
an offshore platform or  a pipeline) would be required before production  could begin, and where the economic viability  of that major capital expenditure depends on  Standalone Financial Statements  295 the successful completion of further exploration  work in the area, remain capitalized on the  balance sheet as long as additional exploration  or appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
It is not unusual to have exploration wells  and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells  remaining suspended on the balance sheet for  several years while additional appraisal drilling  and seismic work on the potential oil and natural  gas field is performed or while the optimum  development plans and timing are established.
All  such carried costs are subject to regular technical,  commercial and management review on at least  an annual basis to confirm the continued intent  to develop, or otherwise extract value from the  discovery.
Where this is no longer the case, the  costs are immediately expensed.
4.2.
Assumptions and key sources of estimation  uncertainty  Information about estimates and assumptions  that have the significant effect on recognition  and measurement of assets, liabilities, income  and expenses is provided below.
Actual results  may differ from these estimates.
(a) Estimation of provision  for decommissioning  The Company estimates provision for  decommissioning as per the principles of  Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets’ for the future  decommissioning of Oil and Gas assets at  the end of their economic lives.
Most of these  decommissioning activities would be in the  future, the exact requirements that may have to be  met when the removal events occur are uncertain.
T echnologies and costs for decommissioning are  constantly changing.
The timing and amounts  of future cash flows are subject to significant  uncertainty.
The timing and amount of future expenditures  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,  together with rate of inflation for escalation of  current cost estimates and the interest rate used  in discounting the cash flows.
The economic life  of the Oil and Gas assets is estimated on the basis  of long term production profile of the relevant  Oil and Gas asset.
The General Consumer Price  Index (CPI) for inflation i.e.
3.81% (Previous  year 4.83%) has been used for escalation of  the current cost estimates and discounting rate  used to determine the balance sheet obligation  as at the end of the year is 7.12% (Previous year  7.56%), which is the risk free government bond  rate with 10 year yield.
(b) Determination of cash generating unit  (CGU)  The Company is engaged mainly in the business  of oil and gas exploration and production in  Onshore and Offshore.
In case of onshore  assets, the fields are using common production/ transportation facilities and are sufficiently  economically interdependent to constitute a  single cash generating unit (CGU).
Accordingly,  impairment test of all onshore fields is performed  in aggregate of all those fields at the Asset Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field is generally  considered as CGU except for fields which  are developed as a Cluster, for which common  facilities are used, in which case the impairment  testing is performed in aggregate for all the fields  included in the cluster.
(c) Impairment of assets  Determination as to whether, and by how  much, a CGU is impaired involves Management  estimates on uncertain matters such as future  prices, the effects of inflation on operating  expenses, discount rates, production profiles for  crude oil, natural gas and value added products.
For Oil and Gas assets, the expected future  cash flows are estimated using Management’s  best estimate of future crude oil and natural gas  prices, production and reserves volumes.
The present values of cash flows are determined  by applying pre tax-discount rates of  14.88%  (previous year 19.06 %) for Rupee transactions  and 10.57% (previous year 13.37 %) for crude  oil and value added products revenue, which  are measured in USD.
Future cash inflows from  sale of crude oil and value added products are  computed using the future prices, on the basis of  market-based average prices of the Dated Brent  crude oil as per assessment by ‘Platt’s Crude Oil  296 Market wire’ and its co-relations with benchmark  crudes and other petroleum products.
Future  cash flows from sale of natural gas are also  computed based on the expected future prices  on the basis of the notification issued by the  Government of India and discounted applying  the rate applicable to the cash flows measured  in USD in view of the new pricing guidelines  issued by GoI.
The discount rate used is based upon the cost of  capital from an established model.
The Value in use of the producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage  approach, wherein future cash flows are  initially estimated based on Proved Developed  Reserves.
Under circumstances where the  further development of the fields in the CGUs is  under progress and where the carrying value of  the CGUs is not likely to be recovered through  exploitation of proved developed reserves  alone, the Proved and probable reserves (2P)  of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose of  estimating future cash flows.
In such cases, full  estimate of the expected cost of evaluation/ development is also considered while  determining the value in use.
The discount rates applied in the assessment  of impairment calculation are re-assessed  each year.
(d) Estimation of reserves  Management estimates production profile  (proved and developed reserves) in relation to  all the Oil and Gas Assets based on the policies  and procedures determined by the Reserves  Estimation Committee of the Company (REC).
The estimates so determined are used for the  computation of depletion and impairment  testing.
The year-end reserves of the Company have been  estimated by the REC which follows international  reservoir engineering procedures consistently.
The Company has adopted deterministic  approach for reserves estimation and is following  Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) – 1997  guidelines which defines reserves as “estimated  volumes of crude oils, condensate, natural gas,  natural gas liquids and associated substances  anticipated to be commercially recoverable  from known accumulations from a given date  forward, under existing economic conditions,  by established operating practices, and under  current Government regulations.
” Volumetric  estimation is the main procedure in estimation,  which uses reservoir rock and fluid properties to  calculate hydrocarbons in-place and then estimate  that portion which will be recovered from it.
As the field gets matured with reasonably good  production history available then performance  methods such as material balance, simulation,  decline curve analysis are applied to get more  accurate assessments of reserves.
The annual revision of estimates is based on the  yearly exploratory and development activities  and results thereof.
New in- place Volume and  Ultimate Reserves are estimated for new field  discoveries or new pool discoveries in already  discovered fields.
Also, appraisal activities lead  to revision in estimates due to new sub-surface  data.
Similarly, reinterpretation exercise is also  carried out for old fields due to necessity of  revision in petro-physical parameters, updating  of static and dynamic models and performance  analysis leading to change in reserves.
Intervention of new technology, change in  classifications and contractual provisions also  necessitate revision in estimation of reserves.
The Company uses the services of third party  agencies for due diligence and it gets the reserves  of its assets audited by third party periodically by  internationally reputed consultants who adopt  latest industry practices for their evaluation.
(e) Defined benefit obligation (DBO)   Management’s estimate of the DBO is based on a  number of critical underlying assumptions such  as standard rates of inflation, medical cost trends,  mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future  salary increases.
Variation in these assumptions  may significantly impact the DBO amount and the  annual defined benefit expenses.

However, these  companies are reputed and creditworthy public  sector undertakings (PSUs).

The recovery  is towards certain observations raised by  auditors appointed by the Director General  of Hydrocarbons (DGH) under Production  Sharing Contract (PSC) for the period 2002- 03 to 2005-06 in respect of cost and profit  petroleum share payable to GoI.
BGEPIL along  with RIL (“Claimants”) have served a notice  of arbitration on the GoI in respect of dispute,  differences and claims arisen in connection  with the terms of Panna, Mukta and T apti  PSCs.
Since the Company is not a party to  the arbitration proceedings, it had requested  MoP&NG that in case of an arbitral award the  same be made applicable to ONGC also, as a  constituent of contractor for both the PSCs.
Subsequently, vide letter dated July 4, 2011  MoP&NG has advised ONGC not to participate  in the arbitration initiated by RIL and BGEPIL  under Panna Mukta and T apti PSCs.
MoP&NG  has also stated that in case of an arbitral award,  the same will be applicable to ONGC also as a  constituent of the contractor for both the PSCs.
Pending final arbitral award, the same has been  shown as Receivable from GoI under ‘ Advance  Recoverable in Cash under financial assets -  others.
(Figures in `are restated).
14.2 In Ravva Joint Operation, the demand  towards additional profit petroleum raised by  Government of India (GoI), due to differences  in interpretation of the provisions of the  Production Sharing Contract (PSC) in respect  of computation of Post T ax Rate of Return  (PTRR), based on the decision of the Malaysian  High Court setting aside an earlier arbitral  tribunal award in favor of operator, was disputed  by the operator M/s Cairn India Limited.
The  Company is not a party to the dispute but has  agreed to abide by the decision applicable  to the operator.
The Company had made an  impairment towards the claim made by the GoI  in earlier years and the amount of impairment  outstanding as at March 31, 2017 is `10,884.73  million (equivalent to USD 167.84 million)  after adjustments for interest and exchange rate  fluctuations.
The GoI had recovered the above  amount including interest thereon USD 54.88  million ( `3,558.97 million) from the Company  in earlier years which has been carried under  Non-Current Financial Assets in the Balance  Sheet as at March 31,2017.
In subsequent legal proceedings, the Appellate  Authority of the Honorable Malaysian High  Court of Kuala Lumpur had set aside the  decision of the Malaysian High Court and the  earlier decision of arbitral tribunal in favour of  operator was restored, against which the GoI has  preferred an appeal before the Federal Court of  Malaysia.
The Federal Court of Malaysia, vide  its order dated October 11, 2011, has dismissed  the said appeal of the GoI.
The Company has taken up the matter regarding  refund of the recoveries made in view of the  favorable judgment of the Federal Court of  Malaysia with MoP&NG.
However, according  to a communication dated January 13, 2012  received, MoP&NG expressed the view that  ONGC’s proposal would be examined when  the issue of ONGC carry under Ravva PSC is  decided in its entirety by the Government along  with other partners.
In view of the perceived uncertainties  in obtaining the refund at this stage, the  impairment made in the books as above has  been retained and netted off against the amount  recoverable as above in the Financial Statements  for the year ending March 31, 2017.

19.3 Matter of Dispute on Delivery Point of Panna- Mukta gas between Government of India  and PMT JO Partners arose due to differing  interpretation of relevant PSC clauses.
According  to the JO Partners, Delivery Point for Panna- Mukta gas is at Offshore, however, MoP&NG  and GAIL maintained that the delivery point is  onshore at Hazira.
The gas produced from Panna- Mukta fields was transported through Company’s  pipelines.
Owing to the delivery point dispute  neither the seller (PMT JO) nor the buyer of gas  (GAIL) was paying any compensation to ONGC  for usage of its pipeline for gas transportation.
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court  decided that the  Panna Mukta oil fields from where the movement  of goods is occasioned fall within the customs  frontiers of India Consequently, the sale of goods  cannot be said to have taken place in the course of  import of goods into the territory of India.
The  state Government of Gujarat has filed a petition  with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against  the decision of Hon’ble Gujarat High Court.
Since the said matter of determination of delivery  point is pending with the Hon’ble Supreme Court  of India, the amount is maintained in the escrow  accounts by the JO Partners.

When there is a deep market  for such bonds; if the return on plan  asset is below this rate, it will create a  plan deficit.
Currently, for these plans,  investments are made in government  securities, debt instruments, Short  term debt instruments, Equity  instruments and Asset Backed,  T rust Structured securities as per  notification of Ministry of Finance.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest  rate will increase the plan liability;  however, this will be partially offset by  an increase in the return on the plan’s  investments.
Standalone Financial Statements  335 Longevity  risk The present value of the defined  benefit plan liability is calculated by  reference to the best estimate of the  mortality of plan participants both  during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of  the plan participants will increase the  plan’s liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined  benefit plan liability is calculated by  reference to the future salaries of plan  participants.
As such, an increase in  the salary of the plan participants will  increase the plan’s liability.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these  employees.

Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly  from USD denominated receivables and payables.
As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of +/- 5% between USD-INR  currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstand ing foreign currency denominated monetary items at the  period end is presented below:  (` in million) USD sensitivity at year end Year ended March 31, 2017 Year ended March 31, 2016 Assets: Weakening of INR by 5% 603.80 562.98 Strengthening of INR by 5% (603.80) (562.98) Liabilites: Weakening of INR by 5% (3,341.60) (3,479.51) Strengthening of INR by 5% 3,341.60 3,479.51 46.3 Financial risk management objectives  While ensuring liquidity is sufficient to meet Company’s  operational requirements, the Company’s financial  management committee also monitors and manages key  financial risks relating to the operations of the Company  by analyzing exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk (including currency risk  and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
46.4 Market Risk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from  possible market price movements and their impact  on the future performance of a business.
The major  components of market risk are commodity price risk,  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
The primary commodity price risks that the Company  is exposed to include international crude oil prices  that could adversely affect the value of the Company’s  financial assets or expected future cash flows.
Substantial or extended decline in international prices  of crude oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect  on the Company’s reported results.
46.5 Foreign currency risk management Sale price of crude oil is denominated in United States  dollar (USD) though billed and received in Indian  Rupees (INR).
The Company is, therefore, exposed to  foreign currency risk principally out of INR appreciating  against USD.
Foreign currency risks on account of  receipts/revenue and payments/expenses are managed  by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures  through export earnings, wherever possible and carry  unhedged exposures for the residual considering the  natural hedge available to it from domestic sales.
The Company undertakes transactions denominated in  different foreign currencies and consequently exposed  to exchange rate fluctuations.
Exchange rate exposures  are managed within approved policy parameters.
The  carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency  denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities  at the end of the reporting period are as follows.
Standalone Financial Statements  355 Sensitivity of profit or loss before tax to change in +/- 1 USD in prices of crude oil, natural gas & value added products  (VAP) and +/- Re.
1 in exchange rate between INR-USD currency pair is presented as under: ( ` in million) Sensitivity of profit or loss before tax 2016-2017 2015-2016 i.
Impact on profit or loss before tax for USD in prices of crude oil, natural gas & VAP  (+/-) 50,010.72 (+/-)  50,180.09  ii.
Impact on profit or loss before tax for exchange rate (+/-)  8,640.13  (+/-) 10,406.84 In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is  unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk  because the exposure at the end of the reporting period  does not reflect the exposure during the year.
46.5.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts The Company has not entered into any forward foreign  exchange contracts during the reporting period.
46.6 Interest rate risk  The Company has not availed borrowings, hence is not  exposed to interest rate risk.
46.7 Price risks The Company’s equity securities price risk arises from  investments held and classified in the balance sheet  either at fair value through OCI or at fair value through  profit or loss.
The Company’s equity investments in  IOC and GAIL are publicly traded.
Investment of short-term surplus funds of the Company  in liquid schemes of mutual funds provides high level of  liquidity from a portfolio of money market securities and  high quality debt and categorized as ‘low risk’ product  from liquidity and interest rate risk perspectives.
46.7.1 Price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of profit or loss in respect of investments  in equity shares and mutual funds at the end of the  reporting period for +/-5% change in price and net  asset value is presented below: • Profit before tax for the year ended March 31,  2017 would increase/decrease by `1,817.16  million (For the year ended March 31, 2016  would increase/decrease by `1,501.62 million)  as a result of 5%  changes in net asset value of  investment in mutual funds; and • Other comprehensive income for the year ended  March 31, 2017 would increase/decrease by  `14,478.68 million (for the year ended March  31, 2016 would increase/decrease by `7,670.74  million) as a result of 5% changes in fair value of  equity investments measured at FVTOCI.
46.8 Interest rate risk management The Company invests the surplus fund generated from  operations in term deposits with banks and mutual  funds.
Bank deposits are made for a period of upto  12 months carry interest rate as per prevailing market  interest rate.
Considering these bank deposits are short  term in nature, there is no significant interest rate risk.
Average interest earned on term deposit for the year  ended March 31, 2017 was 7.74%.
46.9 Credit risk management Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,  investments carried at amortized cost and deposits  with banks as well as customers including receivables.
Credit risk management considers available reasonable  and supportive forward-looking information including  indicators like external credit rating (as far as available),  macro-economic information (such as regulatory  changes, government directives, market interest rate).
Major customers, being public sector oil marketing  companies (OMCs) and gas companies having highest  credit ratings, carry negligible credit risk.
Concentration  of credit risk to any other counterparty did not exceed  3.19% (previous year 3.61%) of total monetary assets at  any time during the year.
Credit exposure is managed by counterparty limits  for investment of surplus funds which is reviewed by  the Management.
Investments in liquid plan/schemes  are with public sector Asset Management Companies  having highest rating.
For banks, only high rated banks  are considered for placement of deposits.
356 Bank balances are held with reputed and creditworthy  banking institutions.
The Company is exposed to default risk in relation  to financial guarantees given to banks/vendors on  behalf of subsidiaries/joint venture companies for the  estimated amount that would be payable to the third  party for assuming the obligation.
The Company’s  maximum exposure in this regard as at March 31, 2017 is   `443,308.48 million (As at March 31, 2016 is  `326,089.32 million).

Disclosure under Indian Accounting  Standard 36 – Impairment of Assets  48.1 The Company is engaged mainly in the  business of oil and gas exploration and  production in On-shore and Offshore.
In case  of onshore assets, the fields are using common  production/transportation facilities and are  sufficiently economically interdependent  to constitute a single cash generating unit  (CGU).
Accordingly, impairment test of all  onshore fields is performed in aggregate of  all those fields at the Asset Level.
In case of  Offshore Assets, a field is generally considered  as CGU except for fields which are developed  as a Cluster, for which common facilities are  used, in which case the impairment testing  is performed in aggregate for all the fields  included in the cluster.
48.2 The Value in Use of producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage  approach, wherein future cash flows  are initially estimated based on Proved  Developed Reserves.
Under circumstances  where the further development of the fields  in the CGUs is under progress and where the  carrying value of the CGUs is not likely to  be recovered through exploitation of proved  developed reserves alone, the Proved and  probable reserves (2P) of the CGUs are also  taken for the purpose of estimating future  cash flows.
In such cases, full estimate of the  expected cost of evaluation/development is  also considered while determining the value  in use.
48.3 In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows from the continuing use of assets and  from its disposal at the end of its useful life are  discounted to their present value.
The present  value of cash flows has been determined by  applying discount rates of 14.88 % (as at March  31, 2016- 19.06%) for Rupee transactions and  10.57 % (as at March 31, 2016- 13.37%) for  crude oil and value added products revenue,  which are measured in USD.
Future cash inflows  from sale of crude oil and value added products  have been computed using the future prices, on  the basis of market-based average prices of dated  Brent crude oil as per ‘Platt’s Crude oil market  wire’ and its Co-relations with benchmark crude  and other petroleum products.
Future cash flows  from sale of natural gas is also computed based  on the expected future prices on the basis of the  notification issued by the Government of India  and discounted applying the rate applicable to  the cash flows measured in USD in view of the  new pricing guidelines issued by GOI.
(Refer  Note 31.3) 48.4 The Company had provided for an impairment  loss of `32,520.07 million in the previous  year, mainly pertaining to on onshore CGU  Sibsagar amounting to `29,972.00 million  and `1,569.00 million in Pre NELP JO block  RJ-ON-90/1 considering the major decrease  in crude oil prices in the international market.
However, there has been improvement in  prices of crude oil and reduction in the  Gas prices in the current financial year.
Accordingly, the Company has assessed  the impairment as at March 31, 2017 for its  CGUs.
As a result of the change in prices and  other variables, there has been a reversal of  an amount of `13,979.63 million (Previous  year `254.22 million) mainly consisting of  `12,203.54 million for onshore CGU Sibsagar  and `1,569 million in Pre NELP JO block  RJ-ON-90/1.
Balance reversal of impairment  loss amounting to `207.09 million pertains to  other CGUs.
During the year `715.62 million has been provided  for impairment loss mainly consisting of `468.11  million in respect of RJ ON 6 (Previous year  `127.09 million) and `235.11 million in respect  of onshore CGU Silchar and Jodhpur (Previous  year `18.87 million).
Balance impairment loss  amounting to `12.41 million (Previous year    `833.11 million) pertains to other CGUs.

In terms of the statutory provisions of Oilfields  (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948  (ORDA), Petroleum & Natural Gas (PNG)  Rules 1959 and Notifications issued thereunder;  the Company is liable to pay royalty to Central  Government (GoI) and State Governments, on  production of Crude Oil and Natural Gas from  offshore fields and onshore fields, respectively.
Since 2008-09, in terms of GoI directives, the  Company had been paying royalty on crude  oil at realized price which was net of discount  (share of under-recovery of the OMCs as per  GoI directives).
On an application filed by the  State of Gujarat, The Hon’ble High Court of  Gujarat in its order dated November 30, 2013  had directed the Company to pay the shortfall of  royalty on crude oil produced from the onshore  fields in the State of Gujarat on pre-discount  prices from April 1, 2008 onwards.
Based on  the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company  against the said order of The Hon’ble High Court  of Gujarat, pending further orders, Hon’ble  Supreme Court vide order dated February 13,  2014 stayed the operation of the impugned  judgment subject to the condition that the  Company pays royalty to the State of Gujarat on  pre-discounted price of crude oil w.e.f.
February  1, 2014 onwards.
Accordingly, w.e.f.
February  1, 2014, the Company had started depositing  royalty with the State of Gujarat on pre-discount  prices in respect of crude oil production from  Gujarat.
Government of Assam had also filed a Writ  Petition in The Hon’ble High Court of  Guwahati for payment of differential royalty  on pre- discount sale price of crude oil for the  period 2008-09 to 2013-14 which was pending  adjudication.
Government of Assam had also  filed an Interlocutory Application seeking  payment of royalty on pre-discount sale price of  crude oil w.e.f.
February 1, 2014 in terms of The  Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated February  13, 2014.
In the meantime in terms of GoI order   dated July 15, 2016, the Company paid royalty  w.e.f.
February 1, 2014 to other similarly placed  states at pre-discount prices.
Pending the final outcome of the SLP filed  before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, differential  royalty (royalty on pre-discount price minus  royalty on post-discount price) of `148,722.46  million on this account for the period from  April, 2008 to March, 2016 had been considered  as Contingent Liability as at March 31, 2016.
Differential royalty amounting to `24,444.27  million paid to the State Governments w.e.f.
February, 2014 had been considered as deposit.
During the year, a settlement was made by  GoI on February 17, 2017 amongst GoI, State  of Gujarat/Assam and the Company wherein  following was agreed:  i.
The outstanding amoun t towards differential  royalty would be paid by the GoI directly to  the Government of Gujarat and Assam.
ii.
Any payments already made to the State  Governments by the Company shall not be  re-opened and will not be reimbursed or paid  by GoI.
Standalone Financial Statements  367  iii.
All other mutual claims and liabilities shall be  extinguished on the basis of the agreement.
Subsequently, based on affidavits filed by  the Petitioners, Hon’ble Supreme Court  disposed the pending SLP with Supreme  Court and Writ Petition with Guwahati High  Court.
In view of settlement and disposal  of pending SLP , the Company has charged  differential royalty amounting to `24,444.27  million paid to State Governments w.e.f.
February 1, 2014 to Statement of Profit and  Loss.
49.2 A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises  from past events and whose existence will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non- occurrence of one or more uncertain future  events not wholly within the control of the  entity.
During the normal course of business,  several unresolved claims are currently  outstanding.

*Reclassification of Oil and Gas Assets:  Under Previous GAAP, the Company had reported an amount of `667,110.29 million as Oil and Gas Assets.
During 2015-16, the Company made a reclassification of  `247,915.37 million between Oil and Gas Assets and Other Property, Plant and Equipment (Refer  Notes no.5.1 and 6.1) w.e.f.
April 1, 2015.
Accordingly, as at April 1, 2015, the reclassified figures have been presented under Previous GAAP.
376 Explanatory Notes to Balance sheet  Reconciliation: 56.1.1 Adjustment to Oil and gas assets and  Decommissioning Provisions:  Under the  Previous GAAP , discounting of provisions  was not required whereas under Ind AS,  provisions are measured at discounted  amounts, if the effect of time value of money  is material.
The Company has re-measured (as  mentioned in note 4.2.a ) decommissioning  provisions at the transition date by availing  optional exemption as per para D21 of Ind AS  101 ‘First time Adoption of Indian Accounting  Standards’ .
This has resulted in decrease in  decommissioning provision by `61,250.20  million and decrease in oil and gas assets by  `65,876.14 million, CWIP-Development  wells in progress by `259.58 million, CWIP- Other by `120.00 million, as at April 1, 2015.
Similarly, it has resulted in decrease in  decommissioning provision by `88,388.01  million and decrease in oil and gas assets by  `90,955.17 million , Other Property plant  & equipment by `187.50 million, CWIP- Development wells in progress by `34.17  million, CWIP-Others by `1,222.70 million  and Inventory by `164.89 million as at March  31, 2016.
Further there is reduction in transfer  from CWIP-Development wells in progress  by `202.66 million.
The net effect of aforesaid changes is decrease  in total equity by `5,005.26 million as at April  1, 2015 and `4,396.16 million as at March 31,  2016.
56.1.2 Leasehold Land:  Under the Previous GAAP ,  leasehold land were accounted as part of  fixed assets and amortized over the lease  period (except for perpetual lease).
Under  Ind AS, leasehold land for perpetual period  are considered as finance lease.
As stated at  note no.
3.16 the Company has carried the  finance lease at transition date at the fair value  amount of leasehold land on transaction  date resulting in increase in carrying amount  of leasehold land by `417.96 million with  corresponding recognition of finance lease  obligation of `417.96 million.
Further, the  lease rentals capitalized to leasehold land have  been reversed resulting in decrease in total  equity by `267.25 million as at April 1, 2015  and `267.25 million as at March 31, 2016.
56.1.3 Reclassification of leasehold land  : Under  Previous GAAP , leasehold land was shown  as part of fixed assets, whereas under Ind AS  all leases are considered as operating leases  (except perpetual leases) and therefore are  shown as prepayments.
Consequently, as on  the transition date April 1, 2015 an amount of  `3,276.90 million has been decapitalized and  shown as prepayments under Ind AS.
Similarly,  an amount of `3,375.38 million has been shown  as prepayments as at March 31, 2016.
This  reclassification has no impact on equity.
56.1.4 Reclassification of Unamortized  expenditure: Under Previous GAAP ,   unamortized portion of dry dock expenses  were shown a part of other current assets  (`3,574.22 million)/noncurrent assets  (`4,426.69 million).
However, under Ind  AS, as at transition date April 1, 2015, dry  dock expenses of `7,552.79 million has been  capitalized as a component of rigs/vessels  as part of property plant & equipment and  `448.21 million has been treated as Capital  work in progress.
Similarly, an amount of  `4,727.46 million has been capitalized as  component of rig/vessels and `1,830.87  million has been treated as Capital work  in progress as at March 31, 2016.
These  reclassifications have no impact on equity.
56.1.5 Reclassification of assets held for sale: As at  the transition date an amount of `11.42 million  representing helicopters held for sale have  been reclassified from Other Property plant &  equipment to asset held for sale.
Similarly, an  amount of `12.32 million has been reclassified  from Inventory to asset held for sale.
These  reclassifications have no impact on equity.
56.1.6 Deemed Equity:  Under Previous GAAP  interest free loan given to group companies  were recorded at their transaction value.
Under Ind AS, such loans are recognized at  Standalone Financial Statements  377 fair value on the date of disbursements and  the fair value loss on respective transaction  dates is recognized as deemed investment  in subsidiary.
Considering the management  intention to convert an amount of `50,000.00  million into equity of ONGC Videsh limited,  loan amount of `50,000.00 million has been  considered as deemed equity and added to the  carrying amount of investment in subsidiary.
Accordingly, the balance loan outstanding  of `16,142.28 million given to its wholly  owned subsidiary ONGC Videsh Limited on  respective dates of transaction have been fair  valued.
Consequently, the interest amount of  `155.82 million has been adjusted to opening  equity.
Further on fair valuation on transition  date, the fair valuation difference of `2,114.04  million has been treated as deemed equity and  added to the carrying amount of investment  in subsidiaries.
Similarly, an amount of  `2,053.95 million has been added to the  cost of investment in subsidiaries as deemed  equity at March 31, 2016 on account of  disbursements/repayments of loan, there is a  reduction in value of loan by `897.56 million  on valuation of interest free loan resulting in  increase in equity by `1,156.40 million.
56.1.7 Financial Guarantees:  Under Ind AS,  financial guarantee contracts are accounted  as financial liabilities and measured initially  at fair value and subsequently accounted as  mentioned in note no.
3.30.a.
Accordingly,  an amount of `2,437.97 million has been  recognized as deferred financial obligation  as at April 1, 2015 with corresponding debit  to deemed equity in the carrying amount  of investment in subsidiaries.
Similarly,  an amount of `2,326.06 million has been  recognized as financial guarantee obligation as  on March 31, 2016, the corresponding amount  along with the changes in the guarantee during  2015-16, aggregating to `2,779.39 million has  been taken to deemed equity.
56.1.8 Fair valuation of Investments in Equity  Instruments: Under the Previous GAAP ,  long term investments were measured at cost  less diminution in value which is other than  temporary.
Under the Ind AS, investments in  equity instruments of companies other than  Subsidiaries, Associates & Joint Ventures are  measured at fair value.
As at the transition  date, the Company has made irrevocable  choice to account for these investments at fair  value through other comprehensive income  (OCI), resulting in increase in total equity  by `104,118.44 million and `110,535.77  million as at April 1 2015 and March 31, 2016  respectively.
56.1.9 Deemed Investment in ONGC Petro  Additions Limited (OPaL) and ONGC  T ripura Power Company Limited (OTPC):  The Company had extended Advances  against equity pending for allotment as at the  transition date, to Joint Venture Companies  OPaL and OTPC for `7,505.52 million and  `4,645.36 million  respectively.
As at the  transition date, these have been treated as  deemed investments in these companies and  accordingly reclassified from Loans under  Previous GAAP to Investments under Ind AS.
56.1.10 Prior period items:  Under Previous GAAP ,  prior period items were reflected as part  of current year expense or income in the  statement of profit & loss.
Under Ind AS,  material prior period items are adjusted to  the period to which they relate and in case  they relate to the period earlier than period  presented, these are adjusted against opening  equity of the earliest period presented.
Accordingly, the prior period items (net)  of `228.10 million have been adjusted  against equity as on the transition date i.e.
April 1, 2015.
56.1.11 Accounting of loans to employees on  amortised cost method under effective rate  of interest: Under the Previous GAAP , loans  to employees were recorded in the financial  statements at transaction value.
Under Ind  AS, loans given to employees at concessional  rate are required to be recognized at amortised  cost method with Effective Interest Rate.
The difference between the amortized cost  of such loans and transaction value as on the  transition date 1 April 2015, has been adjusted  378 to retained earnings, resulting in decrease in  total equity by `3,883.38 million.
Subsequent  to the transition date, such difference is  charged against statement of profit & loss,  resulting in decrease in profit before tax by  `811.90 million for the year ended March 31,  2016.
Further, the amortized cost accounting  of such loan under the effective interest rate  method, has resulted in increase in interest  income by `593.20 million for the year ended  March 31, 2016.
The net effect of above is  decrease in total equity by `4,102.06 million  as at March 31, 2016.
56.1.12 Accounting of other financial assets and  liabilities on amortised cost method under  effective rate of interest: The adjustments  on account of valuation of financial assets  by applying amortised cost method using  Effective Interest Rate as per requirements  of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’    `55.67 million and liabilities `40.33 million  as at transition date, has been adjusted to  retained earnings resulting in decrease in to  total equity by `15.34 million.
Subsequent to  the transition date, such valuation difference  on financial assets and liabilities has been  recognized in statement of profit & loss  resulting in increase in other expenditure by    `22.56 million and increase in other income by  `15.25 million respectively for the year ended  March 31, 2016.
Further, the accounting of  such financial assets and liabilities under the  effective interest rate method, has resulted in  increase in interest income by `24.60 million  and increase in finance cost by `20.13 million  for the year ended March 31st, 2016.
The net  effect of above is decrease in financial assets by  `42.35 million, decrease in financial liabilities  by `24.16 million and decrease in total equity  by `18.19 million as at March 31, 2016.
56.1.13 Deferred T ax: Deferred tax has been recognized  on the account of adjustments made due to  application of Ind AS.
These adjustments have  resulted in an increase in equity by `2,948.00  million as at April 1, 2015 and `2,383.02 million  as at March 31, 2016.
56.1.14 Government Grant:  Under Previous GAAP  grant received from government for fixed  assets were shown as “Deferred Government  Grant” under the head “Reserve and Surplus” .
Under Ind AS, the deferred government grant  are required to be shown as non-current  liability.
The Company has reclassified the  deferred government grant from reserve and  surplus to non-current liability resulting in  decrease in total equity by `10.49 million as at  April 1, 2015 and by `8.01 million as at March  31, 2016.
56.1.15 Proposed Dividend:  Under the Previous  GAAP , dividends on equity shares  recommended by the Board of Directors after  the end of the reporting period but before the  financial statements were approved for issue  were recognised as a provision in the financial  statements.
However, under Ind AS, such  dividends are recognized when declared by  shareholders in the annual general meeting.
Accordingly, the provision for proposed  dividend of ` 5,148.60 million as at April 1,  2015 included under provisions has been  reversed with corresponding adjustment to  retained earnings, this has been recognized  during the year ended March 31, 2016.
Similarly, the proposed dividend as at March  31, 2016 has also been reversed resulting  in increase in total equity by an amount of  `33,465.84 million as at March 31, 2016.

27 Notes to Profit Reconciliation for the year  2015-16: 56.3.1 R evenue from O perations:    Excise duty: Under Previous GAAP , revenue  from sale of products was presented exclusive  of excise duty.
Under Ind AS, revenue from  sale of goods is presented inclusive of excise  duty and the excise duty paid is presented on  the face of statement of profit and loss as part  of expenses.
This has resulted in an increase in  total revenue and total expenses by `1,971.17  million for the year ended March 31, 2016.
Sales tax and Octroi:  As per practice  followed under Previous GAAP , revenue from  sale of products was presented inclusive of  sales tax and octroi with corresponding charge  to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
In terms  of Para 8 of Ind AS 18 ‘Revenue’ sale of goods  has been presented net of sales tax and Octroi.
This has resulted in a decrease in total revenue  and total expenses by `8,234.34 million for  the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.2 Loans to Subsidiaries accounted at  amortised cost method under effective rate  of interest: Interest free loan given to wholly  owned subsidiary ONGC Videsh Limited  has been valued by applying amortised cost  method using Effective Interest Rate as  per requirements of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial  Standalone Financial Statements  381 Instruments’ and resulting difference has  been recognized as cost of investment in  the subsidiary.
As a result of accounting  loan amount of `16,142.28 million (after  considering `50,000.00 million as deemed  equity) under effective interest rate method,  interest income has increased by `1,000.58  million for the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.3 Loans to employees accounted at  amortised cost method under effective  rate of interest: Loans given to employees  at concessional rate have been valued by  applying amortised cost method using  Effective Interest Rate as per requirements  of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ .
The  resulting fair value difference in respect of  loans disbursed after the transition date has  been recognized in statement of profit & loss,  resulting in increase in other expenditure by    `811.90 million for the year ended March 31,  2016.
Further, the accounting of such loan under  the effective interest rate method has resulted in  increase in interest income by `593.20 million  for the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.4 Other financial assets and liabilities  accounted at amortised cost method under  effective rate of interest: Financial assets  and liabilities have been valued by applying  amortised cost method using Effective  Interest Rate as per requirements of Ind AS  109 ‘Financial Instruments’ .
Subsequent to  transition date, the fair valuation difference  on financial assets and liabilities has been  recognized in statement of profit & loss,  resulting in increase in other expenditure by    `22.56 million and increase in other income by  `15.25 million respectively for the year ended  March 31, 2016.
Further, the accounting of  such financial assets and liabilities under the  effective interest rate method has resulted in  increase in interest income by `24.60 million  and increase in finance cost by `20.13 million  for the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.5 Amortization of financial guarantees:  As  stated at note 3.30.a, financial guarantees  have been recognized as deferred financial  guarantee obligation as at the transition date.
Such guarantees have been amortized to  statement of profit & loss over the guarantee  period, resulting in increase in other income  by `453.33 million during year ended March  31, 2016.
56.3.6 Reclassification of Unamortized Dry  dock: Under Previous GAAP , the dry dock  expenses were amortized and relevant portion  was shown as other expenditure.
However,  under Ind AS, dry dock expenses have been  capitalized as a component of rigs/vessels  and charged as depreciation in the statement  of profit & loss.
This has resulted in decrease  in other expenditure by `3,312.69 million and  with corresponding increase in depreciation  by `3,312.69 million.
56.3.7 Reclassification of leasehold land  : Under  Previous GAAP , leasehold land was shown  as part of fixed assets and depreciated based  on leasehold period, whereas under Ind AS  all leases are considered as operating leases  (except perpetual leases) and therefore are  shown as prepayments and amortized over the  leasehold period.
This reclassification resulted  in decrease in depreciation expense by `69.71  million with corresponding increase in other  expenditure.
Further, as stated at note no.
3.16 the  Company has assessed a perpetual lease hold  land as finance lease consequently annual  finance lease charges amounting to `35.04  million has been accounted as finance cost.
56.3.8 Depreciation, Depletion,  Amortisation  and Impairment: As stated at note no.
56.1.1  Oil and gas assets were adjusted as on the  transition date consequent to application  of para D21 of Ind AS 101 on First time  Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards.
This has resulted in decrease in carrying value  of oil and gas assets by `65,876.14 million  as at the transition date.
Accordingly, the  depletion under Ind AS for the year ended 31  March 2016 has reduced by `8,460.62 million.
Further impairment shown as exceptional  item under IGAAP has reduced by `801.37  million on account of the same.
382   Further, as a result of decrease in depletion,  the closing stock valuation has decreased by   `164.89 million as at March 31, 2016    Any change in the present value of the  estimated decommissioning expenditure  other than the periodic unwinding of discount  is adjusted to the decommissioning provision  and the carrying value of the corresponding  asset.
In case reversal of provision exceeds  the carrying amount of the related asset, the  excess amount is recognized in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
On remeasurement of  decommissioning provision where the  provision exceeded the carrying amount  of the related assets, the excess provision  of `6,084.86 million has been written back  as other income during the year ended   31st March, 2016.
Further there is a decrease  in other expenditure amounting to `225.57  million due to foreign exchange difference  on re-measurement of decommissioning  provisions.
56.3.9 Impairment .
As stated at note no.
3.34  as on  transition date, the net book value of property  plant & equipment has been carried forward  as deemed cost consequent to para 7AA of  Ind AS 101 on First time Adoption of Indian  Accounting Standards.
As a result of this, the  accumulated impairment has been deemed to  be subsumed in the net book value of property  plant & equipment.
Accordingly, impairment  of `1,645.10 million written back and shown  under exceptional items in IGAAP has been  adjusted in the Ind AS accounts for the year  ended 31st March, 2016.
56.3.10 Unwinding of discount on  Decommissioning Provisions:  Under the  Previous GAAP , discounting of provisions  was not required whereas under Ind AS,  provisions are measured at discounted  amounts, if the effect of time value of money  is material.
As a result, the unwinding of  discount on decommissioning provisions has  been recognized in the Statement of profit and  loss as finance cost i.e.
`13,136.26 million for  the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.11 Prior period items:  Under Previous GAAP ,  prior period items were reflected as part  of current year expense or income in the  statement of profit & loss.
Under Ind AS,  material prior period items are adjusted to  the period to which they relate and in case  they relate to the period earlier than period  presented, these are adjusted against opening  equity of the earliest period presented.
Accordingly, the prior period items (net) of  `228.10 million have been adjusted against  equity as on the transition date i.e.
April 1,  2015 resulting in increase in profit before tax  for the year ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.12 Deferred T ax: Deferred tax has been  recognized on the account of adjustments  made due to application of Ind AS.
These  adjustments have resulted in an increase in  deferred tax by `722.38 million during year  ended March 31, 2016.
56.3.13 Remeasurement of defined benefit  plans: Under Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits’  Remeasurement i.e.
actuarial gains and  losses of defined benefit plans amounting  to `454.78 million (deferred tax impact  `157.39 million) have been recognised in  other comprehensive income.
Accordingly  remeasurement for 2015-16 amounting to    `443.09 million and `11.69 million have been  adjusted from Production, T ransportation,  Selling & Distribution expenditure and Survey  costs respectively resulted in corresponding  increase in Net Profit after tax.
56.3.14 Fair valuation of Investments in Equity  Instruments: As stated at note no.3.34  (viii), the Company has irrevocably elected  to present the changes in fair value of  equity instruments of companies other  than Subsidiaries, Associates & Joint  Ventures are measured at fair value in Other  Comprehensive Income (OCI), as at April  1, 2015.
Subsequent fair value changes have  been recognized in Other Comprehensive  Income (OCI).
This has resulted in increase  in other comprehensive income by `6,417.34  million during year ended March 31, 2016.

However, under Ind AS, these have been  capitalized as a component of rigs/vessels as  part of property plant & equipment.
This has  resulted in increase in Net cash flows from  operating activities by `1,870.01 million with  corresponding decrease in “Net cash flows  from investing activities” .
56.6 .2 Reclassification of leasehold land : Under  Previous GAAP , leasehold land was shown as  part of fixed assets, whereas under Ind AS all  leases are considered as operating leases (except  perpetual leases) and therefore are shown as  prepayments.
This has resulted in decrease  in Net cash flows from operating activities by    `168.19 million with corresponding increase  in “Net cash flows from investing activities” .
Notes to Effect of Ind AS adoption on the statement of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2016: Standalone Financial Statements  385 56.6 .3 Reclassification of Interest accrued on non- current deposits: Under Previous GAAP ,  interest accrued on non-current deposits  was shown separately as interest accrued  under noncurrent assets and accordingly the  changes in interest accrued was shown as  part of adjustment to interest received under  cash flow from investment activities.
Under  Ind AS, these are shown as part of deposits  against which interest has been accrued.
This  has resulted in decrease in Net cash flows from  operating activities by `14.31 million with  corresponding increase in “Net cash flows  from investing activities” .
56.6 .4 Short term investment in mutual funds:   Under previous GAAP , short term investments  in mutual funds were shown as part of  reconciliation to cash and cash equivalents  for the purposes of Cash Flow Statement.
Under Ind AS, these investments have been  carried at fair value through profit and loss  and hence have not been treated as part of  cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of  statement of cash flows.
Accordingly, changes  in investment in mutual funds amounting to  `30,032.38 million have been reflected as part  of “Net cash flows from investing activities”  under Ind AS.

Management’ s Responsibility for Internal Financial  Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Holding  company, its subsidiary companies, associates and  joint  ventures  which are companies incorporated in  India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal control  over financial reporting criteria established by the  Independent Auditors’ Report  409 of Chartered Accountants of India.
These Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls over financial  reporting was established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and  their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial  reporting included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls over financial reporting,  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  and the audit  evidence  obtained  by  the  other  auditors in terms of their reports referred to in  the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Company’s internal financial controls system over  financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A company’ s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are  being made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or  disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a  material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial controls over financial reporting, including  the possibility of collusion or improper management  override of controls, material misstatements due to  error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls over financial reporting to future periods are  subject to the risk that the internal financial control over  financial reporting may become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance  with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company,  its subsidiary  companies, associates and joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, have, in all material  respects, an adequate internal financial controls system  over financial reporting and such internal financial  controls over financial reporting were operating  effectively as at 31st March 2017, based on the internal  control over financial reporting criteria established by  the Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India.
Other Matters Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3) of the  Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of  the internal financial controls over financial reporting  in so far as it relates to three subsidiary companies, an  associate and five joint ventures which are companies  incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding  standalone / consolidated reports of the auditors, as  applicable, of such companies incorporated in India.
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3) of the Act  on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the  410 internal financial controls over financial reporting does not include in respect of one associate and one joint  venture, which are companies incorporated in India whose audit reports are not available.

2.
Application of new Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS)  All the Indian Accounting Standards issued and  notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) till the financial  statements are authorized have been considered in  preparing these financial statements.
2.1.
Standards issued but not yet effective  In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs  issued the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying  amendments to Ind AS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’  and Ind AS 102, ‘Share-based payment.
’ These  amendments are in accordance with the recent  amendments made by International Accounting  Standards Board (IASB) to IAS 7, ‘Statement of  cash flows’ and IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payment,’  respectively.
The amendments are applicable to  the Group from April 1, 2017.
Amendment to Ind AS 7:  The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities  to provide disclosures that enable users of financial  statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising  from financing activities, including both changes  arising from cash flows and non-cash changes,  suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between  the opening and closing balances in the balance  sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities,  to meet the disclosure requirement.
The Group is evaluating the requirements of the  amendment and the effect on the Consolidated  Financial Statements is being evaluated.
Amendment to Ind AS 102:  The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific  guidance to measurement of cash-settled awards,  modification of cash-settled awards and awards  that include a net settlement feature in respect of  withholding taxes.
As the Group has not issued any stock option  plans, hence this amendment will have no effect  on the Group’s financial statements.
3.
Significant Group Accounting Policies 3.1.
Statement of compliance  In accordance with the notification dated  16th February, 2015, issued by the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs, the Group has adopted Indian  Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”)  notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) with effect  from April 1, 2016.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared in accordance with Ind AS notified under  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015 (as amended) and Guidance Note on  Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities  (Ind AS) issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
These are the Group’s first  Ind AS Consolidated Financial Statements.
The  date of transition to Ind AS is April 1, 2015.
The  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended March 31, 2017 421Consolidated Financial Statements mandatory exceptions and optional exemptions  availed by the Group on First-time adoption have  been detailed in Note 3.39.
Previous period figures in the Consolidated  Financial Statements have been restated in  compliance to Ind AS.
Up to the year ended March 31, 2016, the  Group had prepared the Consolidated Financial  Statements under the historical cost convention  on accrual basis in accordance with the Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles (Previous  GAAP) applicable in India, applying the Guidance  Note on Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing  Activities (Revised 2013) issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India and the applicable  Accounting Standards as prescribed under the  provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 read with  the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
In accordance with Ind AS 101-“First Time  adoption of Indian Accounting Standards” (Ind  AS 101), the Group has presented a reconciliation  of Shareholders’ equity under Previous GAAP and  Ind AS as at March 31, 2016, and April 1, 2015 and  of the Net Profit as per Previous GAAP and T otal  Comprehensive Income under Ind AS for the year  ended March 31, 2016.
3.2.
Basis of preparation  The Consolidated Financial Statements have been  prepared on the historical cost basis except for  certain financial instruments that are measured at  fair values at the end of each reporting period, as  explained in the accounting policies below:  Historical cost is generally based on the fair value  of the consideration given in exchange for goods  and services.
As the operating cycle cannot be identified in  normal course due to the special nature of industry,  the same has been assumed to have duration of 12  months.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities have  been classified as current or non-current as per the  operating cycle and other criteria set out in Ind  AS-1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and  Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are  presented in Indian Rupees and all values are  rounded off to the nearest two decimal million  except otherwise stated.
Fair value measurement  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date under current market conditions.
The Group categorizes assets and liabilities  measured at fair value into one of three levels  depending on the ability to observe inputs  employed in their measurement which are  described as follows:  • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical assets or  liabilities.
• Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable,  either directly or indirectly, other than quoted  prices included within level 1 for the asset or  liability.
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for  the asset or liability reflecting significant  modifications to observable related market  data or Group’s assumptions about pricing by  market participants.
3.3.
Principles of Consolidation  The Consolidated Financ ial Statements incorporate  the financial statements of the Company and its  subsidiaries (collectively referred as “the Group”).
The Group has investments in joint ventures and  associates which are accounted using equity method  in these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Refer  note 3.7 for the accounting policy of investment  in joint ventures and associate in the Consolidated  Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the  Company.
The Company controls an entity when  it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from  its involvement with the entity and has the ability  to affect those returns through its power to direct  the relevant activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are  consolidated from the date of their acquisition,  being the date on which the Company obtains  control and continue to be consolidated until the  date that such control ceases.
422  The Consolidated Financial Statements are  prepared using uniform accounting policies  consistently for like transactions and other events  in similar circumstances and are presented to  the extent possible, in the same manner as the  Company’s Standalone Financial Statements  except otherwise stated.
When necessary,  adjustments are made to the financial statements  of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies  into line with the Group’s accounting policies.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have  been prepared by combining the financial  statements of  the company and its subsidiaries  on a line-by-line basis by adding together the  book values of like items of assets, liabilities,  equity, income, expenses and cash f low after  eliminating in full intra-group assets, liabilities,  equity, income, expenses and cash f low relating to  intra-group transactions and unrealized profits.
U nrealized losses are also eliminated unless th e  transaction provides evidence of an impairment  of the asset transferred.
Such unrealized profit/ losses are fully attributed to the Company.
Profit or loss and each component of other  comprehensive income are attributed to the  owners of the Company and to the non-controlling  interests.
T otal comprehensive income is attributed  to the owners of the Company and to the non- controlling interests even if this results in the non- controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in  subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for  as equity transactions.
The carrying amounts of  the Group’s interests and the non-controlling  interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in  their relative interests in the subsidiaries.
Any  difference between the amount by which the non- controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value  of the consideration paid or received is recognised  directly in equity and attributed to the owners of  the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary,  a gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss and is calculated as  the difference between (i) the aggregate of the  fair value of the consideration received and the  fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the  previous carrying amount of the assets (including  goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any  non-controlling interests.
All amounts previously  recognised in other comprehensive income in  relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as  if the Group had directly disposed of the related  assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e.
reclassified  to the consolidated statement of profit and loss  or transferred to another category of equity  as specified/permitted by applicable Ind AS).
The fair value of any investment retained in the  former subsidiary at the date when control is lost  is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition  for subsequent accounting under Ind AS 109, or,  when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of  an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
3.4. Business Combination  Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for  using the acquisition method.
The consideration  transferred in a business combination is measured  at fair value which is calculated as the sum of the  acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred  by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to  the former owners of the acquiree and the equity  interests issued by the Group in exchange of  control of the acquiree.
Acquisition related costs  are generally recognised in consolidated statement  of profit and loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised  at their fair value, except that:  - Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets  or liabilities related to employee benefit  arrangements are recognised and measured in  accordance with Ind AS 12 ‘Income T axes’ and  Ind AS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ respectively;  - Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified  as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS  105 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and  Discontinued Operations’ are measured in  accordance with that Standard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of  the consideration transferred, the amount of any  423Consolidated Financial Statements non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the  fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity  interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the  acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed.
In case of a bargain purchase, before recognising  a gain in respect thereof, the Group determines  whether there exists clear evidence of the  underlying reasons for classifying the business  combination as a bargain purchase.
Thereafter,  the Group reassesses whether it has correctly  identified all of the assets acquired and all of the  liabilities assumed and recognises any additional  assets or liabilities that are identified in that  reassessment.
The Group then reviews the  procedures used to measure the amounts that  Ind AS requires for the purposes of calculating  the bargain purchase.
If the gain remains after this  reassessment and review, the Group recognises it  in other comprehensive income and accumulates  the same in equity as capital reserve.
This gain  is attributed to the acquirer.
If there does not  exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for  classifying the business combination as a bargain  purchase, the Group recognises the gain, after  reassessing and reviewing (as described above),  directly in equity as capital reserve.
When the consideration transferred by the Group  in a business combination includes assets or  liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration  arrangement, the contingent consideration is  measured at its acquisition date fair value and  included as part of the consideration transferred  in a business combination.
Changes in the fair  value of the contingent consideration that qualify  as measurement period adjustments are adjusted  retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments  against goodwill or capital reserve, as the case  may be.
Measurement period adjustments are  adjustments that arise from additional information  obtained by the Group during the ‘measurement  period’ about facts and circumstances that existed  at the acquisition date.
Measurement period does  not exceed one year from the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the  fair value of the contingent consideration that do  not qualify as measurement period adjustments  depends on how the contingent consideration  is classified.
Contingent consideration that is  classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent  reporting dates and its subsequent settlement  is accounted for within equity.
Contingent  consideration that is classified as an asset or a  liability is remeasured at fair value at subsequent  reporting dates with the corresponding gain or loss  being recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss.
When a business combination is achieved in  stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest  in the acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition  date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if  any, is recognised in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss.
Amounts arising from interests  in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date  that have previously been recognised in other  comprehensive income are reclassified to the  consolidated statement of profit and loss where  such treatment would be appropriate if that interest  were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination  is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in  which the combination occurs, the Group reports  provisional amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional  amounts are adjusted during the measurement  period recognising additional assets or liabilities  (if any) to reflect new information obtained  about facts and circumstances that existed at the  acquisition date that, if known, would have affected  the amounts recognised at that date.
3.5.
Non-controlling interests  Non-controlling interests represent the proportion  of income, other comprehensive income and net  assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the  Company’s shareholders.
Non-controlling interests are initially measured  at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate  share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s  identifiable net assets.
Subsequent to acquisition,  the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is  the amount of the interest at initial recognition plus  the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent  changes in equity.
424 3.6.
Goodwill on consolidation  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business  is carried at cost as established at the date of  acquisition of the business less accumulated  impairment losses, if any.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is  allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units  (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected  to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more  frequently when there is an indication that the cash  generating unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable  amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its  carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated  first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill  allocated to the cash generating unit and then to  the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the  carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any  impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly  in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
An  impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not  reversed in subsequent periods.
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit,  the attributable amount of goodwill is included in  the determination of the Profit and Loss.
3.7.
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures  An Associate is an entity over which the Group has  significant influence.
Significant influence is the  power to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control  or joint control over those policies.
A Joint Venture is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of  control of an arrangement, which exists only when  decisions about the relevant activities require  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates or  joint ventures are incorporated in the Consolidated  Financial Statements using the equity method  of accounting, except when the investment, or  a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in  which case it is accounted for in accordance with  Ind AS 105 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale  and Discontinued Operations’ .
Under the equity  method, an investment in an associate or a joint  venture is initially recognised in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to  recognize the Group’s share of profit or loss and  other comprehensive income of the associate  or joint venture.
Distributions received from an  associate or a joint venture reduces the carrying  amount of investment.
When the Group’s share of  losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the  Group’s interest in that associate or joint venture  (which includes any long term interests that, in  substance, form part of the Group’s net investment  in the associate or joint venture), the Group  discontinues recognizing its share of further losses.
Additional losses are recognized only to the extent  that the Group has legal or constructive obligations  or made payments on behalf of the associate or  joint venture.
Loans advanced to Joint Venture and Associate,  that have the characteristics of financing through  equity are also included in the investment of the  Group’s consolidated balance sheet.
The Group’s  share of amounts recognized directly in equity by  Joint Venture and Associate is recognized in the  Group’s consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the  group and its Joint venture and Associates are  eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in  Joint venture and Associates.
Unrealized losses are  also eliminated to the extent of Group’s interest  unless the transaction provides evidence of an  impairment of the asset transferred.
If an associate or a joint venture uses accounting  policies other than those of the Group accounting  policies for like transactions and events in similar  circumstances, adjustments are made to make the  associate’s or joint venture’s financial statemetns  confirm to the Group’s accounting policies before  applying the equity method, unless, in case of an  associate where it is impracticable do so.
An investment in an Associate or a Joint Venture  is accounted for using the equity method from the  date on which the investee becomes an Associate  or a Joint Venture.
On acquisition of the investment  425Consolidated Financial Statements in an Associate or a Joint Venture, any excess of the  cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the  net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which  is included within the carrying amount of the  investment.
Any excess of the Group’s share of the  net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  over the cost of the investment, after reassessment,  is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve in  the period in which the investment is acquired.
After application of the equity method of  accounting, the Group de termines whether there  is any objective evidence of impairment as a result  of one or more events that occurred after the initial  recognition of the net investment in an associate  or a joint venture and that event (or events) has  an impact on the estimated future cash flows from  the net investment that can be reliably estimated.
If there exists such an objective evidence of  impairment, then Group recognise impairment  loss with respect to the Group’s investment in  an associate or a joint venture.
When necessary,  the entire carrying amount of the investment  (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in  accordance with Ind AS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’  as a single asset by comparing its recoverable  amount (higher of value in use and fair value less  costs of disposal) with its carrying amount, Any  impairment loss recognised forms part of the  carrying amount of the investment.
Any reversal of  that impairment loss is recognised in accordance  with Ind AS 36 to the extent that the recoverable  amount of the investment subsequently increases.
The Group discontinues the use of the equity  method from the date when the investment ceases  to be an associate or a joint venture, or when the  investment is classified as held for sale.
When the  Group retains an interest in the former associate or  joint venture and the retained interest is a financial  asset, the Group measures the retained interest at  fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded  as its fair value on initial recognition in accordance  with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ .
The  difference between the carrying amount of the  associate or joint venture at the date the equity  method was discontinued, and the fair value of any  retained interest and any proceeds from disposing  of a part interest in the associate or joint venture  is included in the determination of the gain or  loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture.
In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive  income in relation to that associate or joint venture  on the same basis as would be required if that  associate or joint venture had directly disposed of  the related assets or liabilities.
Therefore, if a gain or  loss previously recognised in other comprehensive  income by that associate or joint venture would  be reclassified to the consolidated statement of  profit and loss on the disposal of the related assets  or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss  from equity to the consolidated statement of profit  and loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when  the equity method is discontinued.
The Group continues to use the equity method  when an investment in an associate becomes an  investment in a joint venture or an investment  in a joint venture becomes an investment in an  associate.
There is no remeasurement to fair value  upon such changes in ownership interests.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest  in an associate or a joint venture but the Group  continues to use the equity method, the Group  reclassifies to the consolidated statement of  profit and loss the proportion of the gain or loss  that had previously been recognised in other  comprehensive income relating to that reduction  in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be  reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit  and loss on the disposal of the related assets or  liabilities.
When a group entity transacts with an associate  or a joint venture of the Group, profits and losses  resulting from the transactions with the associate  or joint venture are recognised in the Group’s  consolidated financial statements only to the  extent of interests in the associate or joint venture  that are not related to the Group.
3.8.
Interests in joint operations  A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties that have joint control of the arrangement  have rights to the assets, and obligations for the  liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
Joint control  426 is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an  arrangement, which exists only when decisions  about the relevant activities require unanimous  consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group has Joint Operations in the nature of  Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the  Government of India/other countries and various  body corporates for exploration, development and  production activities.
The Group’s share in the assets and liabilities along  with attributable income and expenditure of the  Joint Operations is merged on line by line basis  with the similar items in the Consolidated Financial  Statements and adjusted for leases, depreciation,  overlift/ underlift, depletion, survey, dry wells,  decommissioning provision, impairment and  sidetracking in accordance with the accounting  policies of the Group.
The hydrocarbon reserves in such areas are taken in  proportion to the participating interest of the Group.
Gain or loss on sale of interest in a joint operation,  is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss, except that no gain is recognized  at the time of such sale if substantial uncertainty  exists about the recovery of the costs applicable to  the retained interest or if the Group has substantial  obligation for future performance.
The gain in  such situation is treated as recovery of cost related  to that block.
3.9.
Non-current assets held for sale  Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying  amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are  classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale  transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the  sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal  group is available for immediate sale in its present  condition subject only to terms that are usual and  customary for sales of such assets.
Management  must be committed to the sale, which should be  expected to qualify for recognition as a completed  sale within one year from the date of classification  as held for sale, and actions required to complete  the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely  that significant changes to the plan will be made or  that the plan will be withdrawn.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and  intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized  once classified as held for sale.
3.10.
Government Grant  Government grants, including non-monetary  grants at fair value, are not recognised until there  is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply  with the conditions attached to them and that the  grants will be received.
Government grants are recognised in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis  over the periods in which the Group recognises as  expenses the related costs for which the grants are  intended to compensate.
Government grants whose primary condition  is that the Group should purchase, construct or  otherwise acquire non-current assets and non- monetary grants are recognised and disclosed as  ‘deferred income’ as non-current liability in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet and transferred to the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a  systematic and rational basis over the useful lives  of the related assets.
The benefit of a government loan at a rate below the  market rate of interest is treated as a government  grant, and is measured as the difference between  proceeds received and the fair value of the loan  based on prevailing market interest rates.
3.11.
Property Plant and Equipment (other than  Oil and Gas Assets)  Land and buildings held for use in the production  or supply of goods or services, or for administrative  purposes, are stated in the Balance Sheet at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses,  if any.
Freehold land and land under perpetual  lease are not depreciated.
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) in the  course of construction for production, supply or  administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any  recognised impairment loss.
The cost of an asset  comprises its purchase price or its construction  427Consolidated Financial Statements cost (net of applicable tax credits), any cost directly  attributable to bring the asset into the location and  condition necessary for it to be capable of operating  in the manner intended by the Management and    decommissioning cost as per note 3.17.
It includes  professional fees and, for qualifying assets,  borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with  the Group’s accounting policy.
Such properties  are classified to the appropriate categories of  PPE when completed and ready for intended  use.
Parts of an item of PPE having different  useful lives and significant value and subsequent  expenditure on Property, Plant and Equipment  arising on account of capital improvement or other  factors are accounted for as separate components.
Expenditure on dry docking of rigs and vessels are  accounted as component of relevant assets.
Depreciation  of these PPE commences when the  assets are ready for their intended use.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed on an annual  basis and if necessary, changes in estimates are  accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation on subsequent expenditure on PPE  arising on account of capital improvement or  other factors is provided for prospectively over the  remaining useful life.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated  over their expected useful lives on the same basis  as owned assets.
Depreciation on additions/deletions to PPE  during the year is provided for on a pro-rata basis  with reference to the date of additions/deletions  except low value items not exceeding `5,000/-  which are fully depreciated at the time of addition  of Asset related to operations in India and items not  exceeding USD 100 which are fully depreciated at  the time of addition of Asset related to operations  outside India.
An item of PPE is de-recognised upon disposal or  when no future economic benefits are expected  to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any  gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement  of an item of PPE is determined as the difference  between the sales proceeds and the carrying  amount of the asset and is recognised in the  consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation of these PPE commences when the  assets are ready for their intended use.
The Group and its Joint venture entities and  Associates account for their depreciation on  following basis:-  (a) Depreciation – PPE of Exploration &  Production (E&P) (other than freehold  land, Oil and Gas Assets and properties  under construction)   Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  of E&P operations less their residual values,  using the written down value method (except  for components of dry docking capitalised)  over the useful life of PPE as stated in the  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013  or based on technical assessment by the  Company.
Estimated useful lives of these  assets are as under: Description Useful life in years Building & Bunk Houses 3 to 60 Plant & Machinery 3 to 40 Furniture and Fixtures 3 to 10 Vehicles 3 to 20 Office Equipment 3 to 20   Depreciation on refurbished/revamped PPE  which are capitalized separately is provided  for over the reassessed useful life which is not  more than the life specified in Schedule II to  the Companies Act, 2013.
Depreciation on expenditure on dry docking  of rigs and vessels capitalized as component  of relevant rig/vessels is charged over the dry  dock period on straight line basis.
Depreciation on PPE including support  equipment and facilities used for exploratory/  development drilling is initially capitalised as  part of drilling cost and expensed/depleted as  per Note 3.15.
Depreciation on equipment/  assets deployed for survey activities is charged to  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
428  (b) Depreciation – PPE of Refinery,  Petrochemical, Crude oil T ransportation  and LNG operation business (other  than freehold land and properties under  construction)   Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  less their residual values of asset associated  with Refinery, Petrochemical, Crude oil  T ransportation and LNG operation business,  using Straight Line Method, over the useful life  as specified in Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013, except in case of certain components  of the Plant and Equipment whose useful lives  are determined based on technical evaluation.
Useful lives are as follows:- Asset categories Useful life in years Buildings 1-60 Plant & Machinery 2-40 Furniture 3-10 Office equipment 3-15 Vehicles 4 -8   Expenditure on overhaul and repairs on  account of planned shutdown which are of  significant value (5% of the value of particular  assets) is capitalized as component of relevant  items of PPE and is depreciated over the  period till next shutdown on straight line basis.
Catalyst whose life is more than one year is  capitalised as property, plant and equipment  and depreciated over the guaranteed useful  life as specified by the supplier when the  catalyst is put to use.
(c) Depreciation – PPE of Rate regulated  business:   Depreciation on asset relating to generation  of electricity  associated with rate regulated  business is charged on Straight Line Method  following the rates and methodology provided  under CERC T ariff regulation, 2014 as  notified by the central Electricity Regulatory  Commission except for IT equipment  (including software) on which depreciation is  charged at rate of 30%.
Useful life of the assets relating to generation  and distribution of electricity is determined as  per CERC T ariff Regulations in accordance  with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.
OPAL – One of the biggest downstream integration  projects in India commissioned in FY’17.
429Consolidated Financial Statements   Depreciation on leasehold improvements  has been provided on a straight line basis for  the lease period or estimated useful life,  whichever is less.
(d) Depreciation – PPE of SEZ business:   Depreciation is provided on the cost of PPE  less their residual values of asset associated  with SEZ business, using Straight Line  Method, over the useful life as specified in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013,  except in case of certain components of the  Plant and Equipment whose useful lives are  determined based on technical evaluation.
Useful lives are as follows:-  Asset Useful life in years Plant & Machinery 7-30 3.12.
Intangible Assets  (i) Intangible assets acquired separately   Intangible assets with finite useful lives that  are acquired separately are carried at cost less  accumulated amortisation and impairment  losses.
Amortisation is recognised on a  straight-line basis over their estimated useful  life not exceeding ten years from the date  of capitalization.
Intangible assets in form  of right to use is amortised on straight line  basis over the useful life of underlying asset.
The estimated useful life is reviewed at the  end of each reporting period and the effect  of any changes in estimate being accounted  for prospectively and tested for impairment.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  that are acquired separately are not subject  to amortisation and are carried at cost less  accumulated impairment losses, if any.
An intangible asset is derecognised on  disposal, or when no future economic benefits  are expected from use or disposal.
Gains  or losses arising from derecognition of an  intangible asset, measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the  carrying amount of the asset, and recognised  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss, when the asset is derecognised.
(ii) Intangible assets under development -   Exploratory Wells in Progress    All exploration and evaluation costs incurred  in drilling and equipping exploratory and  appraisal wells, are initially capitalized as  Intangible assets under development -  Exploratory Wells in Progress till the time  these are either transferred to Oil and Gas  Assets on completion as per note no.
3.15 or  expensed as exploration and evaluation cost  (including allocated depreciation) as and  when determined to be dry or of no further  use, as the case may be.
Cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic  test wells are initially capitalized as Intangible  assets under development - Exploratory  Wells in Progress till the time these are either  transferred to Oil and Gas Assets as per note no.
3.15 or expensed as exploration and evaluation  cost (including allocated depreciation) as  when determined to be dry or the petroleum  exploration license/field/project is surrendered.
Costs of exploratory wells are not carried over  unless it could be reasonably demonstrated  that there are indications of sufficient  quantity of reserves and sufficient progress  has been made in assessing the reserves and  the economic and operating viability of the  project.
All such carried over costs are subject  to review for impairment as per the policy of  the Group.
3.13.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets  other than goodwill  The Group reviews the carrying amount of  its tangible and intangib le assets (Oil and Gas  Assets, Development Wells in Progress (DWIP),  and Property, Plant and Equipment (including  Capital Works in Progress) of a “Cash Generating  Unit” (CGU) at the end of each reporting period  to determine whether there is any indication that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If  any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  of the asset is estimated in order to determine the  extent of the impairment loss (if any).
When it is  not possible to estimate the recoverable amount  430 of an individual asset, the Group estimates the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to  which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and  intangible assets not yet available for use are tested  for impairment at least annually or whenever there  is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value  less costs of disposal and v alue in use.
In assessing  value in use, the estimated future cash flows are  discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the  risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of  future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash- generating unit) is estimated to be less than its  carrying amount, the carrying amount of the  asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to  its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is  recognised immediately in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
An  assessment is made at the end of each reporting  period to see if there are any indications that  impairment losses recognized earlier may no longer  exist or may have come down.
The impairment  loss is reversed, if there has been a change in the  estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable  amount since the previous impairment loss was  recognized.
If it is so, the carrying amount of the  asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable  amount and the carrying amount that have  been determined, net of depreciation, had no  impairment loss been recognized for the asset in  prior years.
After a reversal, the depreciation charge  is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s  revised carrying amount, less any residual value,  on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Reversals of impairment loss are recognized in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Impairment testing during exploratory phase is  carried out at area level when further exploration  activities are not planned in near future or when  sufficient data exists to indicate that although a  development in the specific area is likely to proceed,  the carrying amount of the exploration asset is  unlikely to be recovered in full from successful  development or by sale.
Impairment is reversed  subsequently, to the extent that conditions for  impairment are no longer present.
3.14.Exploration & Evaluation, Development and  Production Costs   (i) Pre-acquisition cost   Expenditure incurred before obtaining the  right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil  and gas are expensed as and when incurred.
(ii) Acquisition cost   Acquisition costs of an Oil and Gas Asset  are costs related to right to acquire mineral  interest and are accounted as follows:-   Exploration and development stage   Acquisition cost relating to projects under  exploration or development are initially  accounted as Intangible Assets under  development - exploratory wells in progress  or Oil & Gas Assets under development -  development wells in progress respectively.
Such costs are capitalized by transferring to  Oil and Gas Assets when a well is ready to  commence commercial production.
In case of  abandonment / relinquishment of Intangible  Assets under development - exploratory wells  in progress, such costs are written off.
Production stage   Acquisition costs of a producing Oil and Gas  Assets are capitalized as proved property  acquisition cost under Oil and Gas Assets and  amortized using the unit of production method  over proved reserves of underlying assets.
(iii) Survey cost   Cost of Survey and prospecting activities  conducted in the search of oil and gas are  expensed as exploration cost in the year in  which these are incurred.
(iv) Oil & Gas asset under development -  Development Wells in Progress   All costs relating to Development Wells are  431Consolidated Financial Statements initially capitalized as ‘Development Wells  in Progress’ and transferred to ‘Oil and Gas  Assets’ on “completion” .
(v) Production costs   Production costs include pre-well head  and post-well head expenses including  depreciation and applicable operating costs of  support equipment and facilities.
(vi) Impairment of Acquisition costs relating to  participating rights   For the purposes of impairment testing,  acquisition cost is allocated to each of the Group’s  CGUs (or groups of CGUs) that is expected to  benefit from the synergies of the combination.
A CGU to which acquisition cost has been  allocated is tested for impairment annually  when there is an indication that the unit may  be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the  cash-generating unit is less than its carrying  amount, the impairment loss is allocated  first to reduce the carrying amount of any  acquisition cost allocated to the unit and then  to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on  the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for acquisition  cost is not reversed in subsequent periods.
On disposal of the relevant CGU, the  attributable carrying amount of acquisition  cost is included in the determination of the  profit or loss on disposal.
3.15.
Oil and Gas Assets  Oil and Gas Assets are stated at historical cost less  accumulated depletion and impairment losses.
These are created in respect of an area / field having  proved developed oil and gas reserves, when the  well in the area / field is ready to commence  commercial production.
Cost of temporary occupation of land, successful  exploratory wells, all development wells (including  service wells), allied facilities, depreciation on  support equipment used for drilling and estimated  future decommissioning costs are capitalised and  classified as Oil and Gas Assets.
Oil and Gas Assets are depleted using the “Unit  of Production Method” .
The rate of depletion is  computed with reference to an area covered by  individual lease / license / asset /field /project  / amortization base by considering the proved  developed reserves and related capital costs incurred  including estimated future decommissioning  / abandonment costs net of salvage value.
Acquisition cost of Oil and Gas Assets is depleted  by considering the proved reserves.
These reserves  are estimated annually by the Reserve Estimates  Committee of the Company, which follows the  International Reservoir Engineering Procedures.
3.16.
Side tracking  In the case of an exploratory well, cost of side- tracking is treated in the same manner as the cost  incurred on a new exploratory well.
The cost of  abandoned portion of side tracked exploratory  wells is expensed as ‘Exploration cost written off.
’  In the case of development wells, the entire cost of  abandoned portion and side tracking is capitalized.
In the case of producing wells and service wells,  if the side-tracking results in additional proved  developed oil and gas reserves or increases the  future economic benefits therefrom beyond  previously assessed standard of performance,  the cost incurred on side tracking is capitalised,  whereas the cost of abandoned portion of the  well is depleted in the normal way.
Otherwise,  the cost of side tracking is expensed as ‘Work over  Expenditure.
’ 3.17.
Decommissioning costs  Decommissioning cost includes cost of  restoration.
Provision for decommissioning costs  are recognized when the Group has a legal or  constructive obligation to plug and abandon a  well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item  of Property, Plant and Equipment and to restore  the site on which it is located.
The full eventual  estimated liability towards costs relating to  dismantling, abandoning and restoring well sites  and allied facilities are recognized in respective  assets when the well is complete/facilities or  Property, Plant and Equipment are installed.
The amount recognized is the present value of the  432 estimated future expenditure determined using  existing technology at current prices and escalated  using appropriate inflation rate till the expected  date of decommissioning and discounted up to  the reporting date using the appropriate risk free  discount rate.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning  provision is recognized along with the cost of  exploratory well or Property, Plant and Equipment.
The decommissioning cost in respect of dry well is  expensed as exploratory well cost.
Any change in the present value of the estimated  decommissioning expenditure other than the  periodic unwinding of discount is adjusted  to the decommissioning provision and the  corresponding carrying value of the related asset.
In case reversal of decommissioning provision  exceeds the corresponding carrying amount of  the related asset, the excess amount is recognized  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The unwinding of discount on provision is charged  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  as finance cost.
Provision for decommissioning cost in respect of  assets under Joint Operations is considered as per  participating interest of the Group.
3.18.
Inventories  (a) Raw material and Stock in Process – Refinery & Petrochemicals   Raw material and Stock in Process is valued  at lower of cost or net realizable value.
Raw material is valued based on First in  First Out (FIFO) basis.
Cost of Stock in  Process comprises of raw material cost and  proportionate Conversion cost.
(b) Finished Goods and semi-finished :-  (i) Exploration and Production Operation (E&P)    Finished goods (other than Sulphur) including  inventories in pipeline s / tanks and carbon  credits are valued at cost or net realisable value  whichever is lower.
Cost of finished goods is  determined on absorption costing method.
Sulphur is valued at net realisable value.
The  value of inventories includes excise duty, royalty  (wherever applicable) but excludes Cess.
Crude oil in semi-finished condition at Group  Gathering Stations (GGS) is valued at cost on  absorption costing method or net realisable  value whichever is lower.
Crude oil in unfinished condition in flow lines  up to GGS / platform is not valued as the same  is not measurable.
Natural Gas is not valued as  it is not stored.
(ii) Refinery & Petrochemicals   Cost of finished goods is determined based  on raw material cost, conversion cost and  excise duty.
Cost of semi-finished goods is determined  based on raw material cost and proportionate  conversion cost.
Duty credit scrips which are generated and  are intended to be sold in ordinary course  of business are classified as inventory.
Inventories in respect to duty credit scrips are  subsequently measured at the lower of cost  and net realisable value.
(c) Store & Spares    Inventory of stores and spare parts is valued  at weighted average cost or net realisable  value, whichever is lower.
Wherever,  weighted average cost or net realisable value  is not available, the cost made available by the  operator is considered for valuation of Stores  and Spares.
Provisions are made for obsolete  and non-moving inventories.
Unserviceable and scrap items, when  determined, are valued at estimated net  realisable value.
3.19.
Revenue recognition   Revenue arising from sale of products is recognized  when the significant risks and rewards of  ownership have passed to the buyer, which is at the  point of transfer of custody to customers, and the  amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it  is probable that the economic benefits associated  with the transaction will flow to the Group.
433Consolidated Financial Statements  Revenue from services is recognized when the  outcome of services can be estimated reliably and it is  probable that the economic benefits associated with  rendering of services will flow to the Group, and the  amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable and represents  amounts receivable for goods and services  provided in the normal course of business, net of  discounts, service tax and sales tax / VAT etc.
Any  retrospective revision in prices is accounted for in  the year of such revision.
Sales are inclusive of all related expenses of the  Group that may be paid by the government based  on the provisions under agreements governing  Group’s activities in the respective field / project.
Any difference as of the reporting date between  the entitlement quantity minus the quantities sold  in respect of crude oil (including condensate), if  positive (i.e.
under lift quantity) the proportionate  production expenditure is treated as prepaid  expenses and, if negative (i.e.
over lift quantity),  a liability for the best estimate of the Group’s  proportionate share of production expenses as  per the Joint Operating Agreement ( JOA) /  Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) is created in  respect of the quantity of crude oil to be foregone  in future period towards settlement of the overlift  quantity of crude oil with corresponding charge to  the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Any payment received in respect of short lifted gas  quantity for which an obligation exists to supply  such gas in subsequent periods is recognised as  Deferred Revenue in the year of receipt.
The same is  recognised as revenue in the year in which such gas is  actually supplied or in the year in which the obligation  to supply such gas ceases, whichever is earlier.
The Group has entered into certain “take or pay”  arrangements with its customers which requires  the Group to deliver specified quantities as per the  arrangement.
In the event of short lifting by the  customer as per the terms of the arrangement, the  Group is entitled to receive revenue in respect of the  short lifted quantities.
Revenue in respect of short  lifted quantities under take or pay arrangements is  recognised when the Group’s obligation to supply  short-lifted quantity ceases as per the arrangement  and it is probable that the economic benefits will  flow to the Group.
Sale of crude oil and natural gas (net of  levies) produced from Intangible assets under  development – Exploratory Wells in Progress / Oil  & Gas assets under development – Development  Wells in Progress is deducted from expenditure on  such wells.

3.21.
Foreign Exchange T ransactions  Items included in the financial statements of each  of the Group’s entities are measured using the  currency of the primary economic environment  in which the entity operates (the “functional  currency”).
The consolidated financial statements  are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is the  Company’s functional currency and the Group’s  presentation currency.
T ransactions in currencies other than the  respective entities’ funct ional currency (foreign  currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange  prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At the  end of each reporting period, monetary items  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  using mean exchange rate prevailing on the last  day of the reporting period.
Non-monetary items  carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign  currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing  at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of  historical cost in a foreign currency are translated  using the exchange rates at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which they arise except  for exchange differences on foreign currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction  for future productive use, which are included in  the cost of those assets when they are regarded as  an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign  currency borrowings.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss in the period in which they arise  except for exchange differences on monetary item  that forms part of a Group’s net investment in a  foreign operation are recognised initially in other  comprehensive income and reclassified from  equity to the consolidated statement of profit and  loss on repayment of the monetary items.
Exchange difference arising in respect of long term  foreign currency monetary items is recognised  in the statement of profit and loss except for the  exchange difference related to long term foreign  currency monetary items recognized as at March  31, 2016, in so far as, these related to the acquisition  of depreciable assets, are adjusted against the cost  of such assets and depreciate the said adjustment,  over the balance life of asset and in other cases  amortised over the balance period  of the long term   foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities.
Exchange differences on monetary items are  recognised in the consolidated statement of  profit and loss in the period in which they arise  except for exchange differences on monetary item  that forms part of a Group’s net investment in a  foreign operation are recognised initially in other  comprehensive income and reclassified from  equity to the consolidated statement of profit and  loss on repayment of the monetary items.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e.
a  disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign  operation, a disposal involving loss of control over  a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a  partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement  or an associate that includes a foreign operation of  which the retained interest becomes a financial  asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated  in equity in respect of that operation attributable to  the owners of the Company are reclassified to the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a  subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that  does not result in the Group losing control over the  subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated  exchange differences are re-attributed to non- 435Consolidated Financial Statements controlling interests and are not recognised in  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
For  all other partial disposals (i.e.
partial disposals  of associates or joint arrangements that do not  result in the Group losing significant influence  or joint control), the proportionate share of the  accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments to identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed through  acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as  assets and liabilities of foreign operation and  translated at rate of exchange prevailing at the end  of each reporting period.
Exchange differences  arising are recognised in other comprehensive  income.

including comparatives)  has been translated at the closing rate at the  date of that balance sheet;  • Equity share capital including equity  component of compound financial  instruments have been translated at exchange  rates at the dates of transaction.
Capital  reserve has been translated at exchange rate at  the dates of transaction.
Other reserves have  been translated using average exchange rates  of the period to which it relates;  • Income and expenses for each consolidated  statement of profit and loss presented have  been translated at exchange rates at the dates  of transaction except for certain items average  rate for the period is used; 3.22.
Employee Benefits  Employee benefits include salaries, wages, provident  fund, gratuity, leave encashment towards un-availed  leave, compensated absences, post-retirement  medical benefits and other terminal benefits.
All short term employee benefits are recognized  at their undiscounted amount in the accounting  period in which they are incurred.
Defined contribution plans  Employee Benefit under defined contribution  plans comprising provident fund, Post Retirement  benefit scheme, Employee Pension Scheme - 1995,  composite social security scheme etc.
is recognized  based on the undiscounted amount of obligations of  the Group to contribute to the plan.
The same is paid  to a fund administered through a separate trust.
Defined benefit plans  Defined retirement benefit plans comprising of  gratuity, post-retirement medical benefits and  other terminal benefits, are recognized based on  the present value of defined benefit obligation  which is computed using the projected unit credit  method, with actuarial valuations being carried out  at the end of each annual reporting period.
These  are accounted either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Net interest on the net defined liability is calculated  by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the  period to the net defined benefit liability or asset  and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  except those included in cost of assets as permitted.
Remeasurement of defined retirement benefit  plans except for leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences,  comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect  of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable)  and the return on plan assets (excluding net  interest as defined above), are recognised in other  comprehensive income except those included in  cost of assets as permitted in the period in which  they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to  profit or loss.
The Group contributes all ascertained liabilities  with respect to gratuity to the respective Gratuity  Fund T rust.
All ascertained liabilities for un-availed  leave are funded with Life Insurance Corporation  of India (LIC) except in case of some subsidiaries.
Other defined benefit schemes are unfunded.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in  436 the Consolidated Financial Statements represents  the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined  benefit plans.
Any surplus resulting from this  calculation is limited to the present value of  any economic benefits available in the form of  reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Other long term employee benefits  Other long term employee benefit comprises of  leave encashment towards un-availed leave and  compensated absences, these are recognized based  on the present value of defined obligation which is  computed using the projected unit credit method,  with actuarial valuations being carried out at the  end of each annual reporting period.
These are  accounted for either as current employee cost or  included in cost of assets as permitted.
Re-measurements of leave encashment towards  un-availed leave and compensated absences are  recognized in the Statement of profit and loss  except those included in cost of assets as permitted  in the period in which they occur.
3.23.
Voluntary Retirement Scheme   Expenditure on Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS) is charged to the Consolidated Statement  of Profit and Loss when incurred.
3.24.
General Administrative Expenses  General administrative expenses which are directly  attributable are allocated to activities and the  balance is charged to Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss.
3.25.
Insurance claims  The Group accounts for insurance claims as  under:-  In case of total loss of asset, by transferring either  the carrying cost of the relevant asset or insurance  value (subject to deductibles), whichever is lower  under the head “Claims Recoverable - Insurance”  on intimation to Insurer.
In case insurance claim is  less than carrying cost, the difference is charged to  consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
In case of partial or other losses, expenditure  incurred/payments made to put such assets back  into use, to meet third party or other liabilities  (less policy deductibles) if any, are accounted for  as “Claims Recoverable-Insurance” .
Insurance  Policy deductibles are expensed in the year the  corresponding expenditure is incurred.
As and when claims are finally received from the  insurer, the difference, if any, between Claims  Recoverable-Insurance and claims received is  recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss.
3.26.
Research and Development Expenditure  Expenditure of capital nature are capitalised and  expenses of revenue nature are charged to the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, as and  when incurred.
3.27.
Income T axes  Income tax expense represents the sum of the  current tax expense and deferred tax.
(i) Current tax   The tax currently payable is based on taxable  profit for the year.
T axable profit differs  from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  because of items of income or expense that  are taxable or deductible in other years and  items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s current tax is calculated using  tax rates and laws that have been enacted  or substantively enacted by the end of the  reporting period.
(ii) Deferred tax   Deferred tax is recognised on temporary  differences between the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated  Financial Statements and the corresponding  tax bases used in the computation of taxable  profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally  recognised for all taxable temporary  differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally  recognised for all deductible temporary  differences to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profits will be available  against which those deductible temporary  differences can be utilised.
Such deferred  tax assets and liabilities are not recognised  if the temporary difference arises from the  437Consolidated Financial Statements initial recognition (other than in a business  combination) of assets and liabilities in a  transaction that affects neither the taxable  profit nor the accounting profit.
In addition,  deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if  the temporary difference arises from the  initial recognition of goodwill.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets  is reviewed at the end of each reporting period  and reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profits will be  available to allow all or part of the deferred tax  asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in  the period in which the liability is settled or  the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities  and assets reflects the tax consequences that  would follow from the manner in which the  Group expects, at the end of the reporting  period, to recover or settle the carrying  amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented  separately in Consolidated Balance sheet  except where there is a right of set-off within  fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle  such balances on a net basis.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for  taxable temporary differences associated with  investment in subsidiaries and associate and  interests in joint ventures, except where the  Group is able to control the reversal of the  temporary difference and it is probable that  the temporary difference will not reverse in  the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets  arising from deductible temporary differences  associated with such interests are recognised  only to the extent that it is probable that  there will be sufficient taxable profits against  which to utilise the benefits of the temporary  differences and they are expected to reverse in  the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum  Alternative T ax (MAT) paid in accordance  with the tax laws in India, which is likely  to give future economic benefits in the  form of availability of set off against future  income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT  is recognised as deferred tax asset in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet when the asset  can be measured reliably and it is probable  that the future economic benefit associated  with asset will be realised.
(iii) Current and deferred tax for the year   Current and deferred tax expense is recognised  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss, except when they relate to items  that are recognised in other comprehensive  income or directly in equity, in which case, the  current and deferred tax are also recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in  equity respectively.
3.28.
Borrowing Costs  Borrowing costs specifically identified to the  acquisition or construction of qualifying assets is  capitalized as part of such assets.
A qualifying asset  is one that necessarily takes substantial period  of time to get ready for intended use.
All other  borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.29.
Rig Days Costs  Rig movement costs are booked to the next location  drilled/planned for drilling.
Abnormal Rig days’ costs  are considered as un-allocable and charged to the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.30.
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and  Contingent Assets   Provisions are recognised when the Group has  a present obligation (legal or constructive) as  a result of a past event, it is probable that the  Group will be required to settle the obligation, and  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the  best estimate of the consideration required to  settle the present obligation at the end of the  438 reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When a provision is measured using the cash  flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its  carrying amount is the present value of those cash  flows (when the effect of the time value of money  is material).
Contingent assets are disclosed in the Consolidated  Financial Statements by way of notes to accounts  when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed in the  Consolidated Financial Statements by way of notes  to accounts, unless possibility of an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefit is remote.
3.31.
Financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are  recognised when Group becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are  initially measured at fair value.
T ransaction  costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition or issue of financial assets and  financial liabilities (other than financial assets  and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from  the fair value of the financial assets or financial  liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
T ransaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets or financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognised immediately in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.32.
Equity instruments  Equity instruments issued by the Company are  recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct  issue costs.
(i) Classification as debt or equity instruments   Debt and equity instruments issued by the  Company are classified as either financial  liabilities or as equity in accordance with the  substance of the contractual arrangements  and the definitions of a financial liability and  an equity instrument.
(ii) Compound financial instruments   The component parts of compound financial  instruments issued by the Group are classified  separately as financial liabilities and equity  in accordance with the substance of the  contractual arrangements.
A conversion  option that will be settled by the exchange of a  fixed amount of cash or another financial asset  for a fixed number of the Company’s own  equity instruments is an equity instrument.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the  liability component is estimated using the  prevailing market interest rate for similar  non-convertible instruments.
This amount  is recognised as a liability on an amortised  cost basis using the effective interest method  until extinguished upon conversion or at the  instrument’s maturity date.
The conversion  option classified as equity is determined  by deducting the amount of the liability  component from the fair value of the  compound financial instrument as a whole.
This is recognised and included in equity, net  of income tax effects, and is not subsequently  remeasured.
In addition, the conversion option  classified as equity will remain in equity until  the conversion option is exercised, in which  case, the balance recognised in equity will be  transferred to other component of equity.
When  the conversion option remains unexercised at  the maturity date of the convertible note, the  balance recognised in equity will be transferred  to retained earnings.
No gain or loss is recognised  in profit or loss upon conversion or expiration of  the conversion option.
T ransaction costs that relate to the issue of the  convertible notes are allocated to the liability  and equity components in proportion to the  allocation of the gross proceeds.
T ransaction  costs relating to the equity component are  recognised directly in equity.
T ransaction  costs relating to the liability component  are included in the carrying amount of the  liability component and are amortised over  the lives of the convertible notes using the  effective interest method 439Consolidated Financial Statements 3.33.
Financial assets  (i) Cash and cash equivalents    The Group considers all highly liquid financial  instruments, which are readily convertible  into known amounts of cash that are subject  to an insignificant risk of change in value and  having original maturities of three months  or less from the date of purchase, to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist  of balances with banks which are unrestricted  for withdrawal and usage.
(ii) Financial assets at amortised cost    Financial assets are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest  method if these financial assets are held within  a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows  and the contractual terms of the financial asset  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that  are solely payments of principal and interest  on the principal amount outstanding.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if  these financial assets are held within a  business whose objective is achieved by  both collecting contractual cash flows and  selling financial assets and the contractual  terms of the financial asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
The Group has made an irrevocable election  to present in other comprehensive income  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity  investments not held for trading.
(iv) Financial assets at fair value through profit  or loss    Financial assets are measured at fair value  through profit or loss unless it is measured at  amortised cost or at fair value through other  comprehensive income on initial recognition.
(v) Impairment of financial assets    The Group assesses at each Consolidated  Balance Sheet date whether a financial asset or  a group of financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS  109 ‘Financial Instruments’ requires expected  credit losses to be measured through a loss  allowance.
The Group recognises lifetime  expected losses for trade receivables that do  not constitute a financing transaction.
For all  other financial assets, expected credit losses  are measured at an amount equal to 12 month  expected credit losses or at an amount equal  to lifetime expected losses, if the credit risk on  the financial asset has increased significantly  since initial recognition.
(vi) Derecognition of financial assets   The Group derecognises a financial asset when  the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  asset expire, or when it transfers the financial  asset and substantially all the risks and rewards  of ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in  its entirety (except for equity instruments  designated as FVTOCI), the difference  between the asset’s carrying amount and  the sum of the consideration received and  receivable is recognised in the Consolidated   Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.34.
Financial liabilities   (i) Financial liabilities    Financial liabilities are measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest method.
(ii) Derecognition of financial liabilities   The Group derecognises financial liabilities  when, and only when, the Group’s obligations  are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
The  difference between the carrying amount of  the financial liability derecognised and the  consideration paid and payable is recognised in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
440 3.35.
Derivative financial instruments   The Group enters into a variety of derivative  financial instruments to manage its exposure  to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks,  including foreign exchange forward contracts and  interest rate swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value  at the date the derivative contracts are entered  into and are subsequently remeasured to their  fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit  or loss immediately unless the derivative is  designated and effective as a hedging instrument,  in which event the timing of the recognition in  profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedging  relationship and the nature of the hedged item.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host  contracts that are not financial assets within the  scope of Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’ are  treated as separate derivatives when their risks  and characteristics are not closely related to those  of the host contracts and the host contracts are  not measured at fair value through profit & Loss  (FVTPL).
3.36.
Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing  the net profit after tax by the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the  period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed  by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted  average number of equity shares considered for  deriving basic earnings per share and also the  weighted average number of equity shares that  could have been issued upon conversion of all  dilutive potential equity shares.
3.37.
Cash Flow Statement  Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any  deferrals or accruals of past or future operating  cash receipts or payments and item of income or  expenses associated with investing or financing  cash flows.
The cash flows are segregated into  operating, investing and financing activities.
3.38.
Segment Reporting  Operating segments are identified and reported  taking into account the different risks and returns,  the organization structure and the internal reporting  systems.
The geographical segments are based on  assets as primary segments and business segments  as secondary segments.
3.39.
First-time adoption – mandatory exceptions  and optional exemptions   (i) Overall principle:   The Group has prepared the opening balance  sheet as per Ind AS as at April 1, 2015  (the transition date) by recognising all assets  and liabilities whose recognition is required  by Ind AS, not recognising items of assets or  liabilities which are not permitted by Ind AS,  by reclassifying certain items from Previous  GAAP to Ind AS as required under the Ind  AS, and applying Ind AS in the measurement  of recognised assets and liabilities.
However,  this principle is subject to certain mandatory  exceptions and certain optional exemptions  availed by the Group as detailed below.
(ii) Derecognition of financial assets and  financial liabilities   The Group has applied the derecognition  requirements of financial assets and financial  liabilities prospectively for transactions occurring  on or after April 1, 2015 (the transition date).
(iii) Classification of debt instruments   The Group has determined the classification  of debt instruments in terms of whether they  meet the amortised cost criteria or the fair  value through other comprehensive income  (FVTOCI) criteria based on the facts and  circumstances that existed as of the transition  date.
(iv) Impairment of financial assets   The Group has applied the impairment  requirements of Ind AS 109 “Financial  Instrument” retrospectively; however, as  permitted by Ind AS 101 “First Time Adoption  441Consolidated Financial Statements of Indian Accounting Standard” , it has used  reasonable and supportable information  that is available without undue cost or effort  to determine the credit risk at the date that  financial instruments were initially recognised  in order to compare it with the credit risk at  the transition date.
Further, the Group has  not undertaken an exhaustive search for  information when determining, at the date of  transition to Ind ASs, whether there have been  significant increases in credit risk since initial  recognition, as permitted by Ind AS 101.
(v) Deemed cost for Property, Plant and  Equipment, Oil and Gas assets and  intangible assets   The Group (except for ONGC Videsh Ltd  where there has been a change in functional  currency due to which this exemption is not  available  as per para D7AA of Ind AS 101 )  has elected to continue with the carrying value  of all of its Property, Plant and Equipment,  Oil and Gas assets and intangible assets  recognised as of April 1, 2015 (transition  date) measured as per the Previous GAAP  and use that carrying value as its deemed cost  as of the transition date except adjustment  related to  decommissioning liabilities.
(vi) Determining whether an arrangement  contains a lease   The Group has applied ‘ Appendix C’ of Ind  AS 17 “Leases” for determining whether an  arrangement contains a Lease at the transition  date on the basis of facts and circumstances  existing at that date.
(vii) Equity investments at fair value through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)   The Group has designated investments in  equity shares as at FVTOCI on the basis of  facts and circumstances that existed at the  transition date.
(viii) Assessment of embedded derivatives   The Group has assessed whether an embedded  derivative is required to be separated from the  host contract and accounted for as a derivative  on the basis of the conditions that existed at  the later of the date it first became a party  to the contract and the date when there has  been a change in the terms of the contract  that significantly modifies the cash flows  that otherwise would be required under the  contract.
(ix) Investments in joint ventures and  associates   The Group has elected to recognise  investment in joint ventures at the aggregate  of the carrying amount of the assets and  liabilities that the group has proportionately  consolidated under previous GAAP on the  transition date, including any goodwill arising  from acquisition.
(x) Decommissioning costs   The Group has availed optional exemption  available with respect to decommissioning  costs included in the Oil and Gas Assets.
Accordingly, the Group has measured the  decommissioning provision in accordance  with Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent  Liabilities and Contingent Assets’ as at  transition date.
The Group has computed  the estimate of the amount that would have  been included in the cost of the related  Oil and Gas Assets by discounting the  decommissioning provision computed at  transition date using its best estimate of the  historical risk adjusted discount rate to the  date when decommissioning liability first  arose.
Thereafter, the Group has computed  depletion / depreciation on Oil and Gas assets  on the aforesaid estimated amount using the  accounting policy mentioned in Note No 3.15  above.
442  (xi) Business combinations   The Group has elected to not to apply Ind AS  103 ‘Business Combinations’ retrospectively  to past business combinations that occurred  before the transition date.
(xii) Government Loans   The Group has applied the exception available  and accordingly carried the amount pertaining  to government loans at the carrying amount  under Previous GAAP at the transition date.
(xiii) Long term foreign currency monetary  items   The Group has adopted the same accounting  policy as per Previous GAAP for the  treatment of exchange differences arising  from translation of long-term foreign  currency monetary items (including assets  under finance leases) recognized in the  Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements for  the year ended March 31, 2016.
(xiv) Non-current assets held for sale   The Group has measured non-current assets  held for sale at the lower of carrying value and  fair value less cost to sell at the date of transition  to Ind ASs in accordance with Ind AS 105.
(xv) Foreign Currency T ranslation Reserve   The Group has elected to continue with  the carrying value of Foreign Currency  T ranslation Reserve, recognized as of April  1, 2015 (transition date) measured as per the  Previous GAAP and adjusted for changes in  foreign currency on account of translation  from functional currency to presentation  currency.
(xvi) Non-controlling interest   The Group has elected to continue with the  carrying value of non-controlling interest,  recognized as of April 1, 2015 (transition  date) measured as per the Previous GAAP and  adjusted for changes in equity under Ind AS.

Critical  Accounting Judgments, Assumptions  and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty  Inherent in the application of many of the accounting  policies used in preparing the Consolidated Ind AS  Financial Statements is the need for Management  to make judgments, estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and  liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues  and expenses.
Actual outcomes could differ from  the estimates and assumptions used.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to  accounting estimates are recognised in the period  in which the estimates are revised and future  periods are affected.
Key source of judgme nts, assumptions and  estimation uncertainty in the preparation of the  Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements which  may cause a material adjustment to the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities within the next  financial year, are in respect of functional currency,  Oil and Gas reserves, impairment, useful lives  of Property, Plant and Equipment, depletion of  oil and gas assets, decommissioning provision,  employee benefit obligations, provisions, provision  for income tax,  measurement of deferred tax assets  and contingent assets & liabilities.
5.1 Cr itical  judgments in applying accounting  policies  The following are the critical judgements, apart from  those involving estimations (Refer note 5.2), that the  Management have made in the process of applying  the Group’s accounting policies and that have the  significant effect on the amounts recognized in the  Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.
(a) Determination  of functional currency   Currency of the primary economic environment  in which the Group’s entities operates (“the  functional currency”) is Indian Rupee (`)  in which the entities primarily generates and  expends cash.
However, primary economic  environment in which OVL group (ONGC  Videsh Ltd and its subsidiaries) is US Dollar  which is the currency in which it primarily  generates and expends cash and accordingly  the functional currency of OVL group has been  assessed as US Dollar.
(b) Classification  of investment   Judgement is required in assessing the level of  control obtained in a transaction to acquire  an interest in another entity; depending upon  the facts and circumstances in each case, the  Company may obtain control, joint control  or significant influence over the entity or  445Consolidated Financial Statements arrangement.
T ransactions which give the  Company control of a business are business  combinations.
If the Company obtains joint  control of an arrangement, judgement is also  required to assess whether the arrangement  is a joint operation or a joint venture.
If  the Company has neither control nor joint  control, it may be in a position to exercise  significant influence over the entity, which is  then classified as an associate.
(i) In ONGC Petro additions Limited as joint  venture (OPAL)   The Company has 49.36% equity interest in  OPAL.
The Company has also subscribed for  1,922 million share warrants on August 25,  2015 entitling the Company to exchange each  warrant with an equity share of face value of   `10 each against which `9.75 has been paid.
Further the Company has also entered into an  arrangement on July 2, 2016 for backstopping  support towards repayment of principal and  cumulative coupon amount for compulsory  convertible debentures amounting to `56,150  Million and cumulative interest thereon  amounting to `3,612.06 Million issued by  OPAL.
The Management has however evaluated the  interest in OPAL to be in the nature of joint  venture as the shareholder agreement between  all the shareholders provides for sharing of  control of the decisions of relevant activities  that require the unanimous consent of all the  parties sharing control.
The Company has  49.36% equity interest in OPAL.
The Management has however evaluated the  interest in OPAL to be in the nature of joint  venture as the shareholder agreement between  all the shareholders provides for sharing of  control of the decisions of relevant activities  that require the unanimous consent of all the  parties sharing control.
(ii) In associates despite participating share  being less than 20%   Considering the power to participate in the  financial and operating policy decisions  of the investees exercised by the Group in  accordance with the applicable agreements  and/or otherwise, the following entities ae  considered associates of the Group despite the  participating interest/shareholding percentage/ right percentage being less than 20%:  • JSC Vankorneft (shareholding of the Group  was 15% for the period May 31, 2016 to  October 28, 2016; shareholding of the Group  increased to 26% from October 28, 2016)  • South East Asia Gas Pipeline (shareholding of  the Group 8.347%)  • Petro Carabobo S.A., Venezuela (shareholding  of the Group 11%)   The Company has 12.50% equity interest in  PLL.
It was classified as Joint Venture in Previous  GAAP , however, in terms of Para 7 of Ind AS 111  “Joint Arrangements” , unanimous consent of all  promoters is not required in relevant activities in  PLL and therefore PLL is not classified as Joint  Venture.
The Company has significant influence  on PLL by way of having right to appoint a  director in PLL and participate in its business  decisions, therefore the same has been classified  as an Associate of the Company.
(c) Determining  whether an arrangement  contain leases and classification of leases   The group enters into service/hiring  arrangements for various assets/services.
The  determination of lease and classification of the  service/hiring arrangement as a finance lease  or operating lease is based on an assessment  of several factors, including, but not limited  to, transfer of ownership of leased asset at end  of lease term, lessee’s option to purchase and  estimated certainty of exercise of such option,  proportion of lease term to the asset’s economic  life, proportion of present value of minimum  lease payments to fair value of leased asset and  extent of specialized nature of the leased asset.
(d) Evaluation  of indicators for impairment of  Oil and Gas Assets   The evaluation of applicability of indicators  446 of impairment of assets requires assessment of  external factors (significant decline in asset’s  value, significant changes in the technological,  market, economic or legal environment,  market interest rates etc.)
and internal factors  (obsolescence or physical damage of an asset,  poor economic performance of the asset etc.)
which could result in significant change in  recoverable amount of the Oil and Gas Assets.
(e) Oil & Gas Accounting   The determination of whether potentially  economic oil and natural gas reserves have  been discovered by an exploration well  is usually made within one year of well  completion, but can take longer, depending  on the complexity of the geological structure.
Exploration wells that discover potentially  economic quantities of oil and natural gas and  are in areas where major capital expenditure  (e.g.
an offshore platform or a pipeline) would  be required before production could begin,  and where the economic viability of that major  capital expenditure depends on the successful  completion of further exploration work in the  area, remain capitalized on the consolidated  balance sheet as long as additional exploration  or appraisal work is under way or firmly planned.
It is not unusual to have exploration wells  and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells  remaining suspended on the consolidated  balance sheet for several years while additional  appraisal drilling and seismic work on the  potential oil and natural gas field is performed  or while the optimum development plans and  timing are established.
All such carried costs  are subject to regular technical, commercial  and management review on at least an annual  basis to confirm the continued intent to  develop, or otherwise extract value from, the  discovery.
Where this is no longer the case,  the costs are immediately expensed.
(f ) Deferred tax liability / deferred tax asset  in respect of undistributed profits/losses  of subsidiaries, branches, investments in  associates and joint ventures   The management exercises judgement in  accounting for deferred tax liability / deferred  tax asset in respect of Group’s investments  in respect of undistributed profits/losses  of subsidiaries, branches, investments  in associates and joint ventures.
In the  judgement of the management, in respect of  undistributed profits/losses of subsidiaries,  branches, investments in joint ventures, the  management is able to control the timing of  the reversal of the temporary differences and  the temporary differences will not be reversed  in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Group does not recognise  a deferred tax liability for all taxable  temporary differences associated with  investments in subsidiaries, branches and  interests in joint ventures.
5.2.
Assumptions and key  sources of estimation  uncertainty  Information about estimates and assumptions  that have the significant effect on recognition and  measurement of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses is provided below.
Actual results may  differ from these estimates.
a) Estimation  of provision  for  decommissioning    The Group estimates provision for  decommissioning as per the principles of  Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets’ for the future  decommissioning of Oil & Gas assets at the  end of their economic lives.
Most of these  decommissioning activities would be in the  future, the exact requirements that may have  to be met when the removal events occur  involve uncertainty.
T echnologies and costs  for decommissioning are constantly changing.
The timing and amounts of future cash flows  are subject to significant uncertainty.
The timing and amount of future expenditures  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,  together with rate of inflation for escalation of  current cost estimates and the interest rate used  in discounting the cash flows.
The economic life  447Consolidated Financial Statements of the Oil & Gas assets is estimated on the basis  of long term production profile of the relevant  Oil & Gas asset.
b) Impairment  of assets   Determination as to whether, and by  how much, a CGU is impaired involves  Management estimates on uncertain matters  such as future prices, the effects of inflation  on operating expenses, discount rates,  production profiles for crude oil, natural gas  and value added  products.
For Oil & Gas  assets, the expected future cash flows are  estimated using Management’s best estimate  of future crude oil and natural gas prices,  production and reserves volumes.
The company’s present values of cash  flows are determined by applying pre tax- discount rates for crude oil and value added  products revenue, which are measured  in USD.
Future cash inflows from sale of  crude oil and value added products are  computed using the future prices, on the  basis of market-based average prices of the  Dated Brent crude oil as per assessment by  ‘Platt’s Crude Oil Market wire’ and its co- relations with benchmark crudes and other  petroleum products.
Future cash flows from  sale of natural gas are also computed based  on the expected future prices on the basis of  the notification issued by the Government  of India and discounted applying the rate  applicable to the cash flows measured in  USD in view of the new pricing guidelines  issued by GoI.
Further, the subsidiary company ONGC  Videsh Ltd,  present values of cash flows are  determined by applying pre tax-discount rates  that reflects current market assessments of  time value of money and the risks specific to  the liability in respect of each of the CGUs.
Future cash inflows from sale of crude oil  are computed using the future prices, on  the basis of market-based forward prices of  the Dated Brent crude oil as per assessment  by Bloomberg and its co-relations with  benchmark crudes a nd other petroleum  products.
Future cash flows from sale of  natural gas are also computed based on the  expected future prices on the basis of the prices  determined in accordance with the respective  agreements and / or market forecast.
The discount rate used is based upon the cost  of capital from an established model.
The Value in use of the producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage  approach, wherein future cash flows are  initially estimated based on Proved Developed  Reserves.
Under circumstances where the  further development of the fields in the CGUs  is under progress and where the carrying  value of the CGUs is not likely to be recovered  through exploitation of proved developed  reserves alone, the Proved and probable  reserves (2P) of the CGUs are also taken for  the purpose of estimating future cash flows.
In  such cases, full estimate of the expected cost  of evaluation/development is also considered  while determining the value in use.
The discount rates applied in the assessment of  impairment calculation are re-assessed each year.
c) Estimation of reserves   Management estimates production profile  (proved and developed reserves) in relation to  all the Oil and Gas Assets based on the policies  and procedures determined by the Reserves  Estimation Committee of the Company  (REC).
The estimates so determined are  used for the computation of depletion and  impairment testing.
The year-end reserves of the Group  have been estimated by the REC which  follows international reservoir engineering  procedures consistently.
The Company has  adopted deterministic approach for reserves  estimation and is following Society of  Petroleum Engineers (SPE) – 1997 guidelines  which defines reserves as “estimated volumes  of crude oils, condensate, natural gas,  natural gas liquids and associated substances  448 anticipated to be commercially recoverable  from known accumulations from a given date  forward, under existing economic conditions,  by established operating practices, and  under current Government regulations.
”  Volumetric estimation is the main procedure  in estimation, which uses reservoir rock and  fluid properties to calculate hydrocarbons in- place and then estimate that portion which  will be recovered from it.
As the field gets  matured with reasonably good production  history available then performance methods  such as material balance, simulation, decline  curve analysis are applied to get more accurate  assessments of reserves.
The annual revision of estimates is based  on the yearly exploratory and development  activities and results thereof.
New in- place  Volume and Ultimate Reserves are estimated  for new field discoveries or new pool  discoveries in already discovered fields.
Also,  appraisal activities lead to revision in estimates  due to new sub-surface data.
Similarly,  reinterpretation exercise is also carried out for  old fields due to necessity of revision in petro- physical parameters, updating of static and  dynamic models and performance analysis  leading to change in reserves.
Intervention  of new technology, change in classifications  and contractual provisions also necessitate  revision in estimation of reserves.
The Group uses the services of third party  agencies for due diligence and it gets the  reserves of its assets audited by third party  periodically by internationally reputed  consultants who adopt latest industry  practices for their evaluation.
d) Determination  of cash generating unit (CGU)   The Group is engaged mainly in the business  of oil and gas exploration and production in  Onshore and Offshore.
In case of onshore  assets, the fields are using common  production/transportation facilities and are  sufficiently economically interdependent  to constitute a single cash generating unit  (CGU).
Accordingly, impairment test of  all onshore fields in India is performed in  aggregate of all those fields at the Asset  Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field  is generally considered as CGU except for  fields which are developed as a Cluster,  for which common facilities are used, in  which case the impairment testing is  performed in aggregate for all the fields  included in the cluster.
e) Defined  benefit obligation (DBO)    Management’s estimate of the DBO is  based on a number of critical underlying  assumptions such as standard rates of  inflation, medical cost trends, mortality,  discount rate and anticipation of future salary  increases.
Variation in these assumptions may  significantly impact the DBO amount and the  annual defined benefit expenses.

Matter of Dispute on Delivery Point of Panna- Mukta gas between Government of India  and PMT JO Partners arose due to differing  interpretation of relevant PSC clauses.
According to the JV Partners, Delivery Point  for Panna-Mukta gas is at Offshore, however,  MoP&NG and GAIL maintained that the  delivery point is onshore at Hazira.
The  gas produced from Panna-Mukta fields was  transported through Company’s pipelines.
Owing to the delivery point dispute neither the  seller (PMT JO) nor the buyer of gas (GAIL)  was paying any compensation to ONGC for  usage of its pipeline for gas transportation.
Hon’ble Gujarat High Court  decided that  the Panna Mukta oil fields from where the  movement of goods is occasioned fall within  the customs frontiers of India Consequently,  the sale of goods cannot be said to have taken  place in the course of import of goods into the  territory of India.
The state Government of  Gujarat has filed a petition with the Hon’ble  Supreme Court of India against the decision  of Hon’ble Gujarat High Court.
Since the said matter of determination of  delivery point is pending with the Hon’ble  Supreme Court of India, the amount is  maintained in the escrow accounts by the JO  Partners.

45.5.6   These plans typically expose the Group  to actuarial risks such as: investment risk,  interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary  risk.
Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined  by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
When there is a deep  market for such bonds; if the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.
Currently, for  these plans, investments are made in government securities, debt instruments, Short term debt instruments,  Equity instruments and Asset Backed, Trust Structured securities as per notification of Ministry of Finance.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an  increase in the return on the plan’s investments.
Consolidated Financial Statement  515 Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the  mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life expectancy of the  plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.
In respect of the above plans, the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan  assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out as at March 31, 2017 by a member firm of the Institute of Actuaries  of India.

Financial risk management objectives  While ensuring liquidity is sufficient to  meet Group’s operational requirements, the  Group financial management committees  also monitors and manages key financial risks  relating to the operations of the respective  companies by analyzing exposures by degree  and magnitude of risks.
These risks include  market risk (including currency risk and price  risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
In case of subsidiary OVL, the Company’s  management seeks to minimise the effects  of these risks by using derivative financial  instruments to hedge risk exposures.
The  use of financial derivatives is governed by the  company’s policies approved by the Board of  Directors, which provide written principles  on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,  credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and  non-derivative financial instruments, and the  investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with  policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the  internal auditors on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial  instruments, including derivative financial  instruments, for speculative purposes.
48.4.
Market Risk  Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising  from possible market price movements and  their impact on the future performance of a  business.
The major components of market risk  are commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and  interest rate risk.
The primary commodity price risks that the  Group is exposed to include international crude  oil prices that could adversely affect the value of  the Group’s financial assets or expected future  cash flows.
Substantial or extended decline in  international prices of crude oil and natural  gas may have an adverse effect on the Group’s  reported results.
Subsidiary Company OVL enters into a variety  of derivative financial instruments to manage its  exposure to foreign currency risk and interest  rate risk, including:  (a) interest rate swaps to mitigate the variable of  rising interest rate  (b) forward foreign exchange contract to hedge  its exposure in respect of Euro bond issued  by the Company and for certain payments in  Russian Rouble.
48.5.
Foreign currency risk management  In case of company, selling price of crude oil  is denominated in United States dollar (USD)  though billed and received in Indian Rupees  (INR).The Company is, therefore, exposed to  foreign currency risk principally out of INR  appreciating against USD.
Foreign currency  exchange risks are managed by netting off  naturally-occurring opposite exposures through  export earnings, wherever possible and carry  unhedged exposures for the residual considering  the natural hedge available to it from domestic  sales.
The company undertakes transactions  denominated in different foreign currencies  and consequently exposed to exchange rate  fluctuations.
Exchange rate exposures are  managed within approved policy parameters.

Exchange  rate exposures are managed within approved  policy parameters.
In respect of subsidiary company OVL, the  functional currency is USD.
The company  undertakes transactions denominated in  different foreign currencies and is consequently  exposed to exchange rate fluctuations due to  overseas operations.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and  monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting  period are as follows: 48.5.1.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis   The Group is principally exposed to foreign currency risk against currency other than functional currency.
Sensitivity of profit or loss arises mainly against EURO and INR borrowing in case of OVL and from USD  denominated receivables and payables in other cases.
In respect of the Company As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of +/- 5% between USD-INR  currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstand ing foreign currency denominated monetary items at the  period end is presented below: Consolidated Financial Statement  543 (` in million) USD sensitivity at year end 2016-2017 2015-2016 Receivables: Weakening of INR by 5% 603.80 562.98 Strengthening of INR by 5% (603.80) (562.98) Payable Weakening of INR by 5% (3,341.60) (3,479.51) Strengthening of INR by 5% 3,341.60 3,479.51 In respect of subsidiary company MRPL (` in million) USD sensitivity at year end 2016-2017 2015-2016 Receivables: Weakening of INR by 5% 385.91 299.15 Strengthening of INR by 5% (385.91) (299.15) Payable Weakening of INR by 5% (2,786.80) (10,422.38) Strengthening of INR by 5% 2,786.80 10,422.38 In respect of subsidiary company OVL, As per management’s assessment of reasonable possible changes in the exchange rate of +/- 5% between USD-EURO  and USD-INR currency pair, sensitivity of profit or loss only on outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary  items at the period end is presented below:       (` in million) USD sensitivity at year end 2016-2017 2015-2016 Borrowings Euro-USD appreciation by 5%  1,819.24  1,971.76  Euro-USD depreciation by 5%  (1,819.24)  (1,971.76) USD-INR appreciation by 5%  193.17  519.38  USD-INR depreciation by 5%  (193.17)  (519.38) In case of Company, sensitivity of profit or loss before tax to change in +/- 1 USD in prices of crude oil, natural gas and  value added products (VAP) and +/- Re.1 in exchange rate between INR-USD currency pair is presented as under:             (` in million) Sensitivity of profit or loss before tax 2016-2017 2015-2016 Impact on profit or loss before tax for USD in prices of crude oil, natural gas  and VAP ( +/-) 50,010.72 ( +/-) 50,180.09 Impact on profit or loss before tax for exchange rate (+/-) 8,640.13 (+/-) 10,406.84 In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrep resentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because  the exposure at the end of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year.
48.5.2.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The subsidiary company OVL generally enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency  payments and receipts to reduce foreign exchange fluctuation risk.In current year, the Company has entered certain  forward contracts to cover exposure towards EURO bond.
544 48.6.
Interest rate risk management  The Group has availed borrowings at fixed  and floating interest rates, hence is exposed to  interest rate risk.
48.6.1.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis In respect of subsidiary company MRPL, The sensitivity analyses below have been determined  based on the exposure to interest rates at the end of  the reporting period.
For floating rate borrowings,  the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the  borrowings outstanding at the end of the reporting  period was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis  point increase or decrease is used for disclosing the  sensitivity analysis.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower  and all other variables were  held constant, the Group’s  profit for the year ended March 31, 2017 would  decrease/increase by ` 404.64 million (for the year  ended March 31, 2016: decrease/increase by `477.15  million).This is mainly attributable to the Group’s  exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
In respect of subsidiary company OVL, The sensitivity analyses below have been determined  based on the exposure to interest rates for both  derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the end  of the reporting period.

Disclosure of Interests in Joint Arrangements  and Associates:  Disclosure of related to joint venture and  associate has been disclosed at note no.12.1.3  and 12.1.4.

Disclosure under Indian Accounting Standard  36 – Impairment of Assets 51.1.
The Company is engaged mainly in the business  of oil and gas exploration and production in  On-shore and Offshore.
In case of onshore  assets, the fields are using common production/ transportation facilities and are sufficiently  economically interdependent to constitute a  single cash generating unit (CGU).Accordingly,  impairment test of all onshore fields is  performed in aggregate of all those fields at the  Asset Level.
In case of Offshore Assets, a field  is generally considered as CGU except for fields  which are developed as a Cluster, for which  common facilities are used, in which case the  impairment testing is performed in aggregate  for all the fields included in the cluster.
51.2.
The Value in Use of producing/developing  CGUs is determined under a multi-stage  approach, wherein future cash flows are  initially estimated based on Proved Developed  Reserves.
Under circumstances where the  further development of the fields in the CGUs is  under progress and where the carrying value of  the CGUs is not likely to be recovered through  exploitation of proved developed reserves  alone, the Proved and probable reserves (2P)  of the CGUs are also taken for the purpose of  estimating future cash flows.
In such cases, full  estimate of the expected cost of evaluation/ development is also considered while  determining the value in use.
51.3.
In assessing v alue in use, the estimated future cash  flows from the continuing use of assets and from its  disposal at the end of its useful life are discounted to  their present value.
The present value of cash flows  has been determined by applying discount rates of  14.88% (as at March 31, 2016 -19.06%) for Rupee  transactions and 10.57% (as at March 31, 2016-  13.37%) for crude oil and value added products  revenue, which are measured in USD.
Future cash  inflows from sale of crude oil and value added  products have been computed using the future  prices, on the basis of market-based average prices  of dated Brent crude oil as per ‘Platt’s Crude oil  market wire’ and its Co-relations with benchmark  crude and other petroleum products.
Future cash  flows from sale of natural gas is also computed  based on the expected future prices on the basis  of the notification issued by the Government of  India and discounted applying the rate applicable  to the cash flows measured in USD in view  of the new pricing guidelines issued by GOI.
(Refer Note 34.3) 51.4.
The Company had provided for an impairment  loss of ` 32,520.07 million in the previous  Consolidated Financial Statement  565 year, mainly pertaining to on onshore CGU  Sibsagar amounting to ` 29,972.00 million  and ` 1,569.00 million in Pre NELP JV block  RJ-ON-90/1 considering the major decrease  in crude oil prices in the international market.
However, there has been improvement in prices  of crude oil and reduction in the Gas prices  in the current financial year.
Accordingly, the  Company has assessed the impairment as at  March 31, 2017 for its CGUs.
As a result of the  change in prices and other variables, there has  been a reversal of an amount of ` 13,979.63  million (Previous year ` 254.21 million) mainly  consisting of ` 12,203.54 million for onshore  CGU Sibsagar and ` 1,569 million in Pre NELP  JV block RJ-ON-90/1.
Balance reversal of  impairment loss amounting to ` 207.09 million  pertains to other CGUs.
51.5.
During the year ` 715.62 million has been provided  for impairment loss mainly consisting of ` 468.11  million in respect of RJ-ON-6 (Previous year  `127.09 million) and ` 235.11 million in respect  of onshore CGU Silchar and Jodhpur (Previous  year ` 18.87million).
Balance impairment loss  amounting to ` 12.41 million (Previous year  `833.11million) pertains to other CGUs.
51.6.
The following 2P reserves for respective CGU were  considered as a basis for the impairment testing: Name of the CGU Quantity of Reserves  used for Impairment  Assessment (In MMT) G1 GS 15 8.97 Jodhpur Onshore Asset 1.06 Silchar Onshore Asset 0.31 RJ-ON-90/1 (Pre NELP PSC  Block) 6.77 B-193 15.23 Sibsagar Onshore Asset 43.56 WO 16 12.32 Rajahmundry Onshore 13.99 51.7.
In respect of Company, impairment testing of  assets under exploratory phase (Exploratory  wells in progress) has been carried out as on  March 31, 2017 and an amount of ` 4,539.44  million ( ` 626.36 million for the year ended  March 31, 2016) has been provided during  the year 2016-17 as impairment loss.
Further,  `966.05 million (` 3,466.20 million for the year  ended March 31, 2016) impairment losses has  been reversed in the Standalone statement of  Profit and Loss as exploratory phase assets have  been transferred to Oil and Gas Assets 51.8.
In respect of subsidiary OVL, carried out  impairment test as at March 31, 2017 in  respect of its Cash Generating Units (CGUs)  based on value in use method.
The Company  identified write back of impairment in respect  of two CGUs and impairment in respect of  three CGU and recognised net impairment  provision of ` 10,062.78 million during the  year ended March 31, 2017 (for the year ended  March 31, 2016 impairment provision of `  47,166.83 million was recognised in respect  of 4 CGUs).The current year provision for  impairment is considered as exceptional item.

In terms of the statutory provisions of  Oilfields (Regulation and Development)  Act, 1948 (ORDA), Petroleum & Natural  Gas (PNG) Rules 1959 and Notifications  issued thereunder; the Company is liable to  pay royalty to Central Government (GoI) and  State Governments, on production of Crude  Oil and Natural Gas from offshore fields and  onshore fields, respectively.
Since 2008-09, in  terms of GoI directives, the Company had been  paying royalty on crude oil at realized price  which was net of discount (share of under- recovery of the OMCs as per GoI directives).
On an application filed by the State of Gujarat,  Consolidated Financial Statement  567 The Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat in its  order dated November 30, 2013 had directed  the Company to pay the shortfall of royalty on  crude oil produced from the onshore fields  in the State of Gujarat on pre-discount prices  from April 1, 2008 onwards.
Based on the  Special Leave Petition filed by the Company  against the said order of The Hon’ble High  Court of Gujarat, pending further orders,  Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated  February 13, 2014 stayed the operation of the  impugned judgment subject to the condition  that the Company pays royalty to the State of  Gujarat on pre-discounted price of crude oil  w.e.f.February 1, 2014 onwards.
Accordingly,  w.e.f.
February 1, 2014, the Company had  started depositing royalty with the State of  Gujarat on pre-discount prices in respect of  crude oil production from Gujarat.
Government of Assam had also filed a Writ  Petition in The Hon’ble High Court of  Guwahati for payment of differential royalty  on pre- discount sale price of crude oil for  the period 2008-09 to 2013-14 which was  pending adjudication.
Government of Assam  had also filed an Interlocutory Application  seeking payment of royalty on pre-discount  sale price of crude oil w.e.f.
February 1, 2014in  terms of The Hon’ble Supreme Court order  dated February 13, 2014.
In the meantime in terms of GoI order dated  July 15, 2016, the Company paid royalty w.e.f.
February 1, 2014to other similarly placed  states at pre-discount prices.
Pending the final outcome of the SLP  filed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court,  differential royalty (royalty on pre-discount  price minus royalty on post-discount price)  of `148,722.46 million on this account for the  period from April, 2008 to March, 2016 had  been considered as Contingent Liability as at  March 31, 2016.
Differential royalty amounting to  `24,444.27million paid to the State  Governments w.e.f.
February, 2014 had been  considered as deposit.
During the year, a settlement was made by  GoI on February 17, 2017 amongst GoI, State  of Gujarat/ Assam and the Company wherein  following was agreed:  (i) The outstanding amount towards differential  royalty would be paid by the GoI directly to  the Government of Gujarat and Assam.
(ii) Any payments already made to the State  Governments by the Company shall not be  re-opened and will not be reimbursed or paid  by GoI.
(iii) All other mutual claims and liabilities shall be  extinguished on the basis of the agreement.
Subsequently, based on affidavits filed by the  Petitioners, Hon’ble Supreme Court disposed  the pending SLP with Supreme Court and  Writ Petition with Guwahati High Court.
In  view of settlement and disposal of pending  SLP , the Company has charged differential  royalty amounting to `24,444.27 million paid  to State Governments w.e.f.

MMTOE denotes “Mill ion metric T onne Oil  Equivalent” and for calculating Oil equivalent  of Gas, 1000 M3 of Gas has been taken to be  equal to 1 MT of Crude Oil.
Variations in  totals, if any, are due to internal summations  and rounding off.
53.3 The year-end reserves of the company have  been estimated by the Reserves Estimation  Committee (REC) which follows international  reservoir engineering procedures consistently.
The company has adopted deterministic  approach for reserves estimation and is  following Society of Petroleum Engineers  (SPE) – 1997 guidelines which defines reserves  as “estimated volumes of crude oils, condensate,  natural gas, natural gas liquids and associated  substances anticipated to be commercially  recoverable from known accumulations from  a given date forward, under existing economic  conditions, by established operating practices,  and under current Government regulations.
”  Volumetric estimation is the main procedure  in estimation, which uses reservoir rock and  fluid properties to calculate hydrocarbons in- place and then estimate that portion which  will be recovered from it.
As the field gets  matured with reasonably good production  history is available then performance method  such as material balance, simulation, decline  curve analysis are applied to get more accurate  assessments of reserves.
The Company uses the services of third party  agencies for due diligence and it gets the reserves  of its assets audited by third party periodically by  internationally reputed consultants who adopt  latest industry practices for their evaluation.
The annual revision of estimates is based on the  yearly exploratory and development activities  and results thereof.
New in- place Volume and  Ultimate Reserves are estimated for new field  discoveries or new pool discoveries in already  discovered fields.
Also, appraisal activities lead  to revision in estimates due to new subsurface  data.
Similarly, reinterpretation exercise is also  carried out for old fields due to necessity of  revision in petro-physical parameters, updating  of static and dynamic models and performance  analysis leading to change in reserves.
Intervention of new technology, change in  classifications and contractual provisions also  necessitates revision in estimation of reserves.

(ii) Adjustment to Oil and gas assets and  Decommissioning Provisions:  Under the  Previous GAAP , discounting of provisions was  not required whereas under Ind AS, provisions  are measured at discounted amounts, if the  effect of time value of money is material.
Accordingly, decommissioning provisions  have been re-measured (as mentioned in note  5.2.
(a) at the transition date by availing optional  exemption as per para D21 of Ind AS 101 ‘First  time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards’ .
This has resulted in change in decommissioning  provisions and related effect of depletion on oil  and gas assets by ` 1,088.43 million as at April 1,  2015 and by ` 1,597.84 million as at March 31,  2016.

(v) Classification of preference shares:   Preference shares were classified as equity  under Previous GAAP .
On transition to Ind  AS, preference shares are to be classified under  equity or liability depending upon the terms  and conditions attached with preference shares.
The preference shares issued do not meet the  definition of equity and therefore the same have  been classified as liability.
This has resulted in  decrease in equity by ` 10,385.70 million as at  April 01, 2015 and by ` 10,083.03 as at March  31, 2016.
(vi) Expected credit loss: Impairment for doubtful  receivables were created based on incurred loss  model under previous GAAP , on transition  to Ind AS, impairment of receivables has been  done based on expected credit loss method.

` 13,136.26 million for the year ended  March 31, 2016.. (iv) Adjustments on account of decommissioning provision: As stated at note no.
55.1.ii Oil and gas assets  were adjusted as on the transition date consequent to  application of para D21 of Ind AS 101 on First time  Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards.
This has resulted in decrease in carrying value of oil and gas assets  as at the transition date.
Accordingly, the depletion under Ind AS for the year ended 31st March 2016 has  reduced by ` 7,520.33 million.
Further impairment shown as exceptional item under previous GAAP has a  reducing impact on profit by` 843.72 million on account of the same.
Any change in the present value of the estimated decommissioning expenditure other than the periodic  unwinding of discount is adjusted to the dec ommissioning provision and the carrying value of the  corresponding asset.
In case reversal of provision exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the excess  amount is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
On remeasurement of decommissioning provision  where the provision exceeded the carrying amount of the related assets, the excess provision of ` 6,084.86  million has been written back as other income during the year ended 31st March, 2016.
Further there is  a decrease in other expenditure amounting to ` 225.57 million due to foreign exchange difference on re- measurement of decommissioning provisions.
(v) Deferred T ax: Deferred tax has been recognized on the account of adjustments made due to application of Ind AS.
These adjustments have resulted in an decrease in deferred tax by ` 4,237.18 million during year ended March 31,  2016.
