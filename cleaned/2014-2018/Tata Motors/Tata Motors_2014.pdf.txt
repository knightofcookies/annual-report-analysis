Both the products  have created high levels of excitement  among the potential customers.
Dear Shareholders, The global economic situation showed signs of strengthening, with  US economy speeding up, but the environment in the Eurozone  remained weak with some early signs of improvement.
GDP growth  in China and India were low as compared to the high growth rates  in the past.
However, both these economies continue to hold a  great promise for leading global growth in future.
The global auto industry recorded a surge in sales with impressive  growth,riding on the back of strong demand in the world’s top  two automobile markets – China and the United States.
The  automotive industry in the US came back to strength from the poor  period of recession, supported by low interest rates and improving  consumer sentiment.
Sales in China- the world’s largest auto market  since 2009- also crossed the 20 million cars mark.
Pressure on  local carmakers built up, as foreign automakers stepped up their  investments in China.
Europe did show some early signs of recovery,  but with high levels of unemployment continuing to prevail in  southern Europe, a clear turnaround was not visible.
Consumer  behavior in that region remains cautious.
CHAIRMAN’S  MESSAGE 05 INDIAN AUTO INDUSTRY AND TATA MOTORS India’s GDP growth continued to be below 5% and Industrial  growth remained in negative territory.
Consequently, the Indian  auto industry witnessed a decline in both passenger vehicles and in  commercial vehicles segment by 4.7% and 22.4% respectively.
For  most of last year, the economy was hamstrung by rising inflation  and high interest rates, leading to relatively low consumer interest  in buying new vehicles, and, in many cases, postponement of  purchase.
In the later part of the year, reduction in excise duty and  partial lifting of mining bans did help in recovery of sentiment, but  only to a limited extent.
High delinquencies in vehicle financing led  to tightening of lending norms by financiers, which badly impacted  the sales of small commercial vehicles and passenger cars.
Tata Motors domestic business, in this tough environment, lost  market share in both commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles  business.
While the competition in both the segments remained  quite aggressive with almost all the players resorting to huge  discounting, Tata Motors’ approach was cautious and responsible.
As integral part of this approach, the Company focused on keeping  inventory levels low in order to reduce the burden on its channel  partners.
On the product front, the company showcased several  impressive new products at the Auto Expo ’14, with a lineup that  included Tata Bolt and Tata Zest, due to be launched in the coming  months.
Both the products have created high levels of excitement  among the potential customers.
The new Prima LX and Ultra  range in commercial vehicles also showcased great promise to be  category leaders.
They aptly demonstrate Tata Motors’ technological  capabilities and the company’s pursuit to offer world-class products  and experience to its customers.
To ensure long-term competitiveness of Tata Motors, the company  also took several steps under the Horizonext strategy- new  products, quality improvement and enhancement of the consumer  experience- that will help improve sustainable profitability of the  Corporate Information Mission, Vision and Values (04-07) Chairman’s Message To ensure long-term competitiveness  of Tata Motors, the company also took  several steps under the Horizonext  strategy- new products, quality  improvement and enhancement of the  consumer experience- that will  help improve sustainable profitability  of the business in long-term.

LOOKING AHEAD The global economy is on the path of recovery, with consumer  sentiment showing signs of improvement in all the major markets.
The auto industry in India too, after one of its worst years, is  seeing early signs of recovery and renewed confidence amongst  consumers,particularly with a stable government at the centre.
We  expect a turnaround of the industry by the later part of this financial  year with a hope that the Government would also come out with  policy interventions that support the growth of auto industry, given  its critical importance to development of the economy.

We are powering the diesel variant of Zest with the first-in-class  F-Tronic technology-enabled, 5-speed Automated Manual  Transmission and a segment-leading 90PS engine with 200 Nm  of uninterrupted flat torque to offer a peppy drive with seamless  delivery of power.
Further, we are introducing EPAS (Electronic Power Assisted  System), with ‘Active Return’ function and speed  sensitive power steering in both cars – the Zest and Bolt – a  first for both segments.
Safety is enhanced with the new and  advanced ABS for improved braking efficiency and with yet another  segment-first, the Cornering Stability feature.
The improved dual- path suspension provides effective isolation from road inputs  without compromising on the body control, translating into a class  leading balance between ride and handling.
This provides for a very  comfortable but engaging drive experience.
A silent, quieter cabin  will ensure a pleasant and superlative drive experience.
21 REVOTRON, our  disruptive Petrol Engine  Technology   With the launch of REVOTRON 1.2T, the  Turbocharged Intercooled Multi-point  Fuel Injected (MPFi) Petrol engine, we  made a strategic shift towards a more  complete portfolio in our passenger  vehicles business.
The REVOTRON series has been  designed based on extensive feedback  from car owners, car enthusiasts and  expert drivers from across the globe;  observing their driving habits followed  by extensive testing in gruelling  climatic conditions in India as well as in  countries like the UK and Korea.
The engine has been manufactured to  be lightweight and low on  friction, delivering high performance  and fuel economy.
The engine comes with another  segment-first – a selectable multi- drive mode and uses low viscosity,  fuel efficient engine oil.
An optimised  water-jacket and head gasket, using  Computational Fluid Dynamics  (CFD) technology, ensures efficient  combustion and reduces thermal inertia.
Embracing new standards in driving comfort We are committed to enhance the driving experience introducing new standards with  innovative technology in the Commercial Vehicles segment.
In Commercial Vehicles, it  is all about catering to customer needs, with new standards in drivability and comfort.
For instance, the LPS 4923 LiftAxle is the first prime mover in India with a lift axle  technology and first 6x2 tractor in the 49-tonne gross vehicle weight (GVW) category.
The resultant hub reduction on the drive axle leads to better drivability, longer axle life  and lesser wear and tear of the tyres.
The Prima 4038.S Truck goes a step further with  massive power of 370 BHP@2,100 RPM and has undergone modifications to match  international standards of the Truck Racing environment, in terms of enhanced safety  and stands for sheer adrenalin.

The said dividend, if approved by the  Members, would involve a cash outflow of `742 crores (previous  year: `728 crores) including dividend distribution tax, resulting in  a payout of 222% (FY 2012-13: 241%) of the standalone profits for  the year and 5% (previous year: 7%) of the consolidated profits of  the Company.
OPERATING RESUL TS AND PROFITS The Global operating environment improved considerably in FY  2013-14, as economic activity strengthened and spending in most  economies began to recover, however in a sporadic manner.
Whilst the  advanced economies, particularly the US and UK, led the rebound, as  growth became broader and more entrenched, Europe saw the first  tentative signs of recovery after a long and painful slowdown.
India’s  economic growth rate in the current financial year remained weak at  4.7% (Previous Year: at 4.5%).
The Industrial activity remained weak  and the stagnation was broad based.
Mining and manufacturing  output remained negative and the economy witnessed decline in  investment in new projects in line with slowdown in overall growth.
FY 2013-14 was a challenging year for the Company as the Indian  economy continued to be under severe stress.
The Tata Motors Group  recorded a 22.2% growth in   gross turnover from `193,698 crores in the previous year to  `236,626 crores in FY 2013-14.
This is the highest turnover recorded  by the Group.
The consolidated revenues (net of excise) for   FY 2013-14 of `232,834 crores grew by 23.3% over last year on the  back of strong growth in volumes across products and markets at  Jaguar Land Rover.
The consolidated EBITDA margins for FY 2013-14  stood at 16.1%.
Consequently, Profit Before Tax and Profit After Tax  were `18,869 crores and `13,991 crores, respectively.
Tata Motors Limited recorded a gross turnover of `37,758 crores,  23.4% lower from `49,320 crores in the previous year.
On top of  a 16.7% decline in FY 2012-13, a decline of more than 40% over a   2 year period was witnessed.
Sustained deceleration in the economic  growth, high inflation, higher fuel prices, reduced availability of finance and  elevated interest rate regime continued to impact demand for the Indian  auto industry in general and commercial vehicle industry in particular.
Additionally, the need to increase marketing expenses on account of  severe competitive intensity and depressed market scenario impacted  EBITDA margins from positive 4.8% in FY 2012-13 to negative 1.4% for FY  2013-14.
The reduction of profits from operations was offset by dividend  from subsidiary companies of `1,574 crores (including dividend from JLR)   as compared to `1,584 crores for the previous year and profit of   `1,966 crores on divestment of investments in certain foreign  subsidiaries to TML Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore, a wholly owned  subsidiary.
Loss Before Tax and Profit After Tax for the FY 2013-14 were  at `1,026 crores and  `335 crores respectively, as compared to Profit   Before Tax and Profit After Tax of `175 crores and `302 crores respectively  in FY 2012-13.
With the expected positive momentum in the Indian economy, the  Company is focused on growth and achieving profitability through  a superior new product pipeline along with a renewed commitment  to enhance quality and customer service and to reduce costs.
The  Horizonext strategy unveiled in the Delhi Auto Expo shed light on  some of the new and exciting product initiatives like Zest, Bolt,  improved Nano, Ultra trucks variants on Prima truck platform and  a slew of other modified and refreshed products which will be  introduced in the near future, boosting the Company’s revenues.
Investment in the right products and vehicle platforms are being  made to ensure a competitive pipeline for the future.
Together  with forward looking product strategy, the Company is also  focusing extensively on right sizing the business and operational  improvements through various strategic projects for operational  excellence and cost cutting initiatives.
Jaguar Land Rover  recorded a turnover of GB£19,386 million, a  growth of 22.8% from GB£15,784 million in the previous year.
JLR  had a successful year of continued growth in all markets with overall  volumes up by 16%, reflecting continued product successes including  the launch of the new Range Rover Sport and Jaguar F-TYPE and a  full year of sales of the new Range Rover.
More established models  have also been performing well, in particular derivatives such as the  XF Sportbrake and all-wheel drive and smaller engine options across  the range.
Consolidated EBITDA for FY 2013-14 was a record GB£3,393  million, an increase of 45.1% compared to FY 2012-13.
The EBITDA  improvement comprises increased sales volumes and revenues, as  well as favourable product and market mix.
Profit before tax (PBT) for  FY 2013-14 was GB£2,501 million, an increase of GB£827 million (49%)  55 Notice Directors’ Report (53-68) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report compared to FY 2012-13.
In FY 2013-14, JLR incurred one off costs  for redemption of the higher coupon GB£500 million and US$410  million 2018 Notes (at 8.125% and 7.75% coupon respectively).
The   bond redemption was pre-financed by the successful issuances  of US$700 million 4.125% 2018 Notes and GB£400 million 5% 2022  Notes, to reduce the Company’s overall cost of debt in line with the  improving credit.
(Jaguar Land Rover’s figures are as per IFRS) Tata Motors Finance Limited , the Company’s captive financing  subsidiary, registered total revenues of `3,026 crores higher by 7%  of FY 2012-13 revenues and reported a Profit After Tax of `101 crores  in FY 2013-14 (FY 2012-13: `309 crores).
The results for the year were  impacted due to tightness in the financial market, stress in the business  environment and the consequent higher provision on account of  Non-Performing Assets.
Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company Limited , South  Korea registered revenues of KRW 884.1 billion ( `4,906 crores),  a growth of 7.3% over the previous year.
The positive impact of  higher volume, various cost control initiatives and price increase  in export market allowed company to achieve profit after tax of  KRW 23.5 billion ( `130.4 crores) [FY 2012-13: loss of KRW 9.2 billion   ( `45 crores)] (TDCV Figures are as per Korean GAAP).
VEHICLE SALES AND MARKET SHARES The Tata Motors Group sales for the year stood at 10,20,546 vehicles,  lower by 14.4% as compared to FY 2012-13.
Global sales of all  Commercial Vehicles were 432,600 vehicles, while sales of Passenger  Vehicles were at 587,946 vehicles.
TATA MOTORS Tata Motors recorded sales of 569,677 vehicles, a decline of 30.2%  over FY 2012-13.
Industry decline during the year was at 9.3%, resulting  in the Company’s market share decreasing to 16.6% in the Indian  automotive industry from 22.1% in the previous year.
The Company  exported 49,922 vehicles, lower by 2.0%, as compared to FY 2012-13.
Commercial Vehicles Within the domestic market, the Company sold 3,77,909 Commercial  Vehicles (CV) , a decline of 29.5% from FY 2012-13.
This represented  a market leadership share of 54.1% in the domestic CV market which  was mainly supported by consolidation in M&HCV segment.
Some of the highlights for the year were:   While the overall industry of M&HCV sales declined, the  Company was able to improve market share by 1.6% to stand  at 54.9%.
A series of products were launched in this segment  to augment the portfolio of product offerings and increase  market share.
These included the Prima LX series of trucks –   a perfect combination of economy and technology – 2523T,  3123T, 4028S (Single reduction and Hub reduction) and 4928S  (Single reduction and Hub reduction), 4923.S LX, Prima 4938  Tractor, 3138K Tipper, LPT 3723 - India’s first 5 axle truck and LPK  3118, and Prima LX series of Tippers  – 2523K, 3123K, 2528K  and 3128K.
Other activities to stimulate market sentiments included the  pioneering T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship  event  as well as the successful value added services, power of five  campaign for trucks focusing on – 1) Better KMPL, 2) Best  Vehicle Uptime, 3) Highest Resale Value, 4) Best in class four year  warranty, and 5) Lowest maintenance cost and five powerful  offerings – a) Triple benefit insurance, b) Increased Oil change  interval, c) four Year AMC, d) Tata Alert, and e) Fleetman.
The bus segment also witnessed reversal in market share  through intensive sales efforts coupled with launch of buses  with mechanical Fuel Injection Pump (FIP), introduction of  Starbus Ultra in Stage carriage, marketing initiatives such as  ‘Humare Bus Ki Baat Hain’ and ‘Dream it to win it’ program.
The warranty for M&HCV buses and trucks were increased  to three years and four years respectively, symbolizing  improvement in quality.
The ‘Tata Alert’ service, to return a  vehicle back on road within 48 hours, has been expanded  across all national highways.
The LCV segment , which registered good growth last year,  did not continue its run this year.
More specifically a decline  in SCV segment due to vehicle financing constraints was a  major problem.
Fund availability is the most critical element  for SCV segment.
The high default rates in CV loans coupled  with early delinquencies have instigated financiers to tighten  lending norms, reduce the (LTV) ratio with focus on collections  impacted the SCV Cargo and SCV Passenger segments quite  sharply.
Some of launches this year included the Ace and  Magic DICOR and facelifts.

Foreign Exchange Earnings and Outgoings  (` in crores) Earning in foreign currency 6,941.73 Expenditure in foreign currency  (including dividend remittance) 2,853.21 On behalf of the Board of Directors  CYRUS P MISTRY Chairman Mumbai, May 29, 2014 69 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report BUSINESS OVERVIEW India’s GDP growth continues to remain weak, at 4.7% in FY 2013-14  (advance estimates) after growing at 4.5% in FY 2012-13.
Industrial  activity continues to remain weak.
Index of Industrial production  (IIP) was negative at 0.1% during FY 2013-14.
The stagnation in  the industrial activity was broad-based.
While mining output  registered a negative of 1.1%, manufacturing output registered a  negative of 0.7% during the same period.
FY 2013-14 witnessed a  decline in investments in new projects in line with slowdown in   overall growth.
Growth rate in GDP   FY 2012-13 FY 2013-14 Q1 4.5 4.7 Q2 4.6 5.2 Q3 4.4 4.6 Q4 4.4 4.6 4.5 4.7 Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme implementation MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  As a result, the domestic auto industry saw decline after a long time.
With the continued high interest rates and inflation, households  were forced to spend more on essentials and discretionary spend  reduced, leading to deferring of purchase decisions.
The consistent  stagnation of the industrial growth mainly in the areas of mining and  quarrying, manufacturing and infrastructure adversely impacted the  domestic auto industry.
On the global economy front, it was still a struggle, with the Euro  zone in recession for much of 2013.
However, in the developed  world which had started as an uneven and patchy, recovery began  to strengthen.
The US economy, despite having to cope with feuding  over its budget, seems to have sped up.
It has been creating jobs  and its housing market and stock indicator have moved up sharply.
By the end of the year 2013, the UK had become, on some counts  the fastest growing large developed economy.
UK labour market  conditions improved as employment increased.
Rising consumer  and business confidence helped to underpin stronger retail sales  and investment spending, while the recovery in house prices helped  shore up household wealth.
This was led by higher consumption, in  turn leading to fears of overheating in the housing market.
Germany had a solid year, reducing unemployment and boosting  living standards.
However, across the Mediterranean the pattern  was more disappointing, with Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece all  enduring a year of rising unemployment.
Europe and the euro are  not out of trouble, but the acute phase of their difficulties may be  past.
However, there is still a long way to go: deflation risks remain,  the sovereign and banking crisis is not fully resolved, and there  is a considerable gulf in performance between the core and the  periphery.
The structural shift from the developed world towards the emerging  world continued but at a slightly slower pace than before.
Industrial  activity picked up pace throughout the year, supporting continued  employment growth.
With asset prices buoyant and confidence  returning, the pillars of support for consumer spending fell back into  place during 2013.
In the emerging markets due to announcement  by the US Federal Reserve in May, that it would soon begin  reducing its monthly asset purchases (so-called “tapering”), caused  currencies to depreciate, stock markets to fall and borrowing costs  to rise.
Countries with large current account and fiscal deficits were  worst affected.
On the back of tight monetary policy, limited Fiscal spending, rising  Inflation and slowing investments, over the previous year, FY 2013- 14 saw many of the same challenges continuing into the year.
FY 2013-14 was marked by the challenge to the Government to  contain the fiscal deficit, and the Government expenditure on  infrastructure and other key sectors suffered.
Current account  deficit was brought in control .

Tata Motors Business:  Consequent to the macro economic factors as explained above, the Indian automobile industry posted a decline of 9.3% in FY 2013-14, as  compared to 1.1% growth in the last fiscal.
The commercial vehicles declined by 22.4% (last year growth of 1.7%) and passenger vehicles  declined by 4.7% (last year growth of 0.9%).

Passenger vehicles include Fiat and Jaguar Land Rover branded cars INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS Commercial Vehicles:  The demand for Commercial vehicles remained depressed throughout the year.
For FY 2013-14 the Commercial vehicle industry volumes  at 698,907 reflect a decline of 22.4% over FY 2012-13.
The Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV) segment recorded a further  negative of 25.2% on the back of 23.3% decline in the last fiscal.
The ban on mining, fleet underutilization, fall in resale value and low  economic activities contributed to the fall.
However, over the last few months, the decline has slowed down and volumes have stabilized  through efforts taken by the Government to revive the sector by 4% reduction in excise duty, partial lifting of mining bans and increase in  freight rates, indicating that the economy may be nearing the end of the down-cycle.
While the M&HCV segment had declined in the last  fiscal, the contraction of the Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) segment by 21.2% is more significant because it was the growth driver in the  past, growing by 17.9% in the last fiscal.
The fall in this segment has been led by the drop in the Small Commercial Vehicle (SCV) volumes  where fund availability is the most critical element.
The high default rates in loans coupled with early delinquencies prompted the financiers  to tighten lending norms, reduce the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and go into a collection mode impacting the SCV segment quite sharply.
The Company registered a decline of 29.5% to 377,909 units, primarily due to fall in LCV volumes coupled with the falling demand in M&HCV.

Even under these difficult conditions, the Company has been able  to gain market share in the critical M&HCV segment.
The Company  has been focusing intensely on market and customer activities  to stimulate the buying sentiments.
Activities included the Prima  Truck Racing Championship event in March, 2014 the first of its kind  initiative in the Indian trucking history.
The Prima LX series of trucks –  a combination of economy &technology - were launched in FY2013- 14 which included – 2523T, 3123T, 4028S (Single reduction and Hub  reduction) and 4928S (Single reduction and Hub reduction), 4923.S  LX, Prima 4938 Tractor, 3138K Tipper, LPT 3723 - India’s first 5 axle  truck and LPK 3118, and Prima LX series of Tippers – 2523K, 3123K,  2528K & 3128K.
One of the successful marketing initiatives was the  Power of Five campaign for M&HCV trucks which was conducted  across various locations across the country to counter competition.
The campaign focuses on five advantages of the Company’s  vehicles – 1) Better KMPL, 2) Best Vehicle Uptime 3) Highest Resale  Value, 4) Best in class four year warranty, 5) Lowest maintenance  cost and five powerful offerings – i) Triple benefit insurance, ii)  Increased Oil change interval, iii) 4 Year AMC, iv) Tata Alert, v)  Fleetman.
The bus segment also witnessed growthin market share  for the Company, due to intensive sales efforts coupled with launch  of buses with mechanical FIP , introduction of Starbus Ultra in Stage  carriage, marketing initiatives such as ‘Humare Bus Ki Baat Hain’ and  ‘Dream it to win it’ program.
The warranty for M&HCV buses and  trucks were increased to three years and four years respectively  symbolizing improvement in quality.
The Tata Alert service, to  return a vehicle back on road within 48 hours, has been expanded  across all national highways.
The Company registered a decline in the market share of LCV  segment due to the sharp fall in volumes of the high share SCV  segment.
The newly launched Ultra trucks have started to receive  good response from the market.
There have been various other  initiatives such as the Freedom campaign and Triumph through  trials campaign of back-to-back and standalone fuel trials to  establish the superior fuel efficiency of vehicles.
The Company tied  up with various PCGs (Public sector, Co-operative & Gramin banks)  and has brought out several lucrative financing schemes to ease the  financing situation.
The Companyalso launched a major initiative  called, ‘Saathi’ , a Parts retailers’ customer referral program for entire  SCV range, to leverage their customer base.
Some of launches this  year were the Ace, Magic DICOR and facelifts.
Passenger Vehicles:  The Passenger Vehicle Industry contracted for the first time in the  last five years, in FY 2013-14 with decline of 4.7%.
The last such  instance was during the economic slowdown of FY 2008-09 when  it remained close to flat at negative 0.5%.
The decline in sales  volumes is seen across segments, but sedans bore the biggest  brunt.
Hatchbacks and UV’s continue to be the volume segments.

Jaguar Land Rover’s performance in key geographical  markets on retail basis  United Kingdom: Against the backdrop of improved labour market  conditions, rising consumer and business confidence and buoyed  by cash compensation from the mis-selling of payment protection  insurance, total vehicle sales jumped 12.5% compared to the  previous year.
Jaguar Land Rover sales climbed 6.2% on the year,  supported by a strong performance from Jaguar (10.7% growth)  and the launch of JLR F-TYPE convertible.
5% annual growth in  Land Rover sales reflects JLR dominant market position in the UK  for SUVs.
United States and North America:  In FY 2013-14, total passenger  car sales expanded by 6.2%.
The launch of the Jaguar F-TYPE and  new Range Rover Sport helped Jaguar Land Rover beat the US  market three times, growing sales by 19.2%.
Alongside a strong  expansion of business in Canada, total Jaguar Land Rover sales in  North America grew 20.2%.
Europe: In Germany, Jaguar Land Rover sales grew 6.5%, against  a meagre 0.2% for total passenger cars.
In Italy, Jaguar Land Rover  sales edged up 1.1%, driven by Land Rover, against a total market  contraction of 1.3%.
Although in France sales fell across the board,  the most surprising performance came from Spain where, after  three years of double-digit contraction, the market rebounded by  11.7% and Jaguar Land Rover sales rose 14.7%.
China: Passenger car sales reached a new peak of almost 18.4  million units in the year to March, growing faster than either of  the previous two years.

Jaguar volumes more than  doubled to 19,891, while Land Rover sales reached 83,186.
75 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report Although it is already the largest car market in the world, unlike the  UK or US, China’s car market remains immature, with low vehicle  ownership rates and huge growth potential.
A rapidly expanding  middle class, fast rising incomes, and a strong preference for  premium vehicles mean considerable opportunities exist for JLR to  increase sales further.
Emerging markets:  In Brazil, rising interest rates and falling  consumer confidence left total new vehicle registrations down 4.5%  year-on-year.
Despite this backdrop, JLR expanded its sales by 21.1%  to over 11,000 vehicles.
Meanwhile, in India and Russia the total  vehicle markets also contracted (by 6.2% and 6.0% respectively),  but JLR grew its sales by 8.6% and 14.7%.
Only in South Africa  did the economic situation overcome JLR sales momentum.
The  25% depreciation in the Rand against Sterling forced JLR to raise  prices to prevent losses being made on several models.
JLR sales  contracted by 9.9% on the previous year.
Asia Pacific: Total JLR sales increased by 27.7% year-on-year to  22,795.
Of the three NSCs in the region, South Korea experienced  the fastest expansion.
On the back of a rebound in economic  growth following the slowdown in 2012, JLR sales jumped 51.8%.
In Japan, advanced purchases of vehicles to beat the increase in the  consumption tax in April 2014 more than offset the deterioration  in consumer sentiment.
Total JLR sales increased by 33.2% against  growth in the total passenger car market of 9.0% in FY 2013-14.
Finally, in Australia, the unwinding of the mining boom and growing  slack in the economy were compounded by dwindling consumer  confidence and rising unemployment.
Total new car sales growth  was a meager 1.3% after over 8% the year before.
JLR sales were  buoyant though, and grew by 15.3%.
Jaguar Land Rover’s Sales & Distribution:  JLR markets products  in over 170 countries, through a global network of 18 national  sales companies (NSCs), 84 importers, 53 export partners and 2,518  franchise sales dealers, of which 784 are joint Jaguar and Land Rover  dealers.

On the other hand  Export volumes (including KD) decreased by 14.6% as compared  to the previous year mainly due to adverse economic conditions  in global markets.
TDCV’s total sales volume increased by 5% in FY  2013-14 compared to FY 2012-13.
Total market for Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) in Korea was  almost stagnant during FY 2013-14 as compared to the previous  year; however the TDCV achieved growth rate of 25.7% with sales of  2,995 units of HCV in FY 2013-14 as compared to 2,383 units in the  previous year.

TDCV exported 4,016 units in FY 2013-14, a reduction of 14.6% as  compared to 4,700 units sold in the previous year.
TDCV’s sales  decreased significantly in some of its traditional export markets like  Russia, Laos, South Africa, Vietnam etc.
Sales in previous year were  high due to few specific tenders (eg.
Kuwait, Iraq) which are not  yearly requirement.
Tata Motors Finance Ltd (TMFL): Due to severely strained market  conditions, total disbursements (including refinance) by TMFL  declined by 22% at `8,767.56 crores as compared to `11,180.03  crores.
TMFL financed a total of 157,886 vehicles reflecting decline  of 38% over the 254,086 vehicles financed in the previous year.
Disbursements for commercial vehicles were at `7,504.35 crores  (123,989 units) as compared to `8,814.90 crores (183,514 units) of  the previous year.
Disbursements of passenger vehicles declined  by 49% to `1,213.46 crores (32,637 units) as compared to `2,363.53  Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 76 Financial Statements crores (70,563 units) in previous year.
Due to weak operating and economic environment in India,  movement of commercial vehicles has slowed down in all  segments and large and small fleet operators have large waiting  period and reduced trips.
Delay in receipt of payments by large fleet  operators from companies is further delaying payments to attached  vehicles of smaller operators.
This has resulted in low income and  increased levels of provisioning, due to loss of contracts by small  fleet operators / First time users in M&HCV / LCV segment since last  few months.
The performance of HCV loans was the weakest due to  slow economic growth, overcapacity and rising input costs.
Various monetary and fiscal measures were unable to stimulate  growth across segments resulting sluggish growth and consequent  lower demand of all commercial and passenger vehicles.
However,  with a highly motivated employee workforce, significantly greater  customer orientation and an increased branch network / field  infrastructure, TMFL is poised for significant, sustainable growth and  is confident that it would deliver on its vision for the future.
With a view to de-risk the portfolio and explore additional sources  of revenue, the used vehicle finance business was re-launched  by seeding the business in select geographies during the year.
Disbursements achieved under refinance were at `49.74 crores  (1,260 vehicles) during FY 2013-14 as against `1.60 crores (9  vehicles) in the previous year.
TMFL increased its reach by opening a number of limited services  branches (called Spoke branches) exclusively in Tier 2 & 3 towns.
This has also helped in reducing the turn-around-times to improve  customer satisfaction.
TMFL ’s new initiative of Channel Finance and fee based Insurance  support business has also helped improve its profitability.
TMFL is  confident of significantly adding to its revenues and profitability  through these new businesses in the coming period.
TMFL has  also tied up with the Company’s used vehicle business for working  together to improve realizationvalue from the sale of repossessed  stocks by refurbishing them and selling them through the  Company’s dealers.
TMFL has further enhanced its “Office of the Customer initiative”    as well as its spokes branch ne twork & infrastructure and is  confident that these investments will pay rich dividends through  significantly increased interactions/relations with its customers  and dealers.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF JLR (AS PER IFRS) The financial statement of JLR is prepared as per International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable in the UK.
This  information is given to enable the readers to understand the  performance of JLR Revenue: During the year, JLR generated record revenue and  profits.
This was primarily driven by increased demand for both  brands as well as a strong product and market mix.
Consolidated  revenues for FY 2013-14 were GB£19,386 million, an increase of  22.8% compared to FY 2012-13.
EBITDA: Consolidated EBITDA for FY 2013-14 was a record  GB£3,393 million, an increase of 45% compared to FY 2012-13.
The EBITDA improvement comprises increased sales volumes and  revenues, as well as favourable product and market mix, as higher  margin products were sold in higher margin destinations, notably  China.
Also JLR has been able to keep costs in check, through cost  discipline, and various efficiencies and improvement initiatives.
Material cost of sales for the year was GB£11,904 million, equivalent  to 61.4% of revenue.
This represents an improvement of 1.3% from  FY 2012-13 in part due to decreases in raw material prices  Employee costs for FY 2013-14 were up GB£320 million (24%)  to GB£1,654 million as JLR has increased permanent and agency  headcount, particularly in product development and manufacturing,  to support the JLR’s growth agenda.. 89 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report Other expense including those relating to manufacturing, launch,  freight and distribution, warranty, product development expense,  selling and fixed marketing, were GB£3,717 million in the year, an  increase of GB£642 million (21%) versus FY 2012-13.
From FY 2013- 14 onwards EBITDA now includes mark to market of current assets  and liabilities and realised gains on matured FX and commodity  hedges for the full year in line with policy under IFRs accounting.
Development costs of GB£1,266 million represent an increase  of GB£208 million (20%).
This reflected the increased spend on  future model development for both brands.
Of the total spending,  GB£1,030 million was capitalised (last year GB£ 860 million).
Profit before tax (PBT) for FY 2013-14 was GB£2,501 million, an  increase of GB£827 million (49%) compared to FY 2012-13.
PBT  performance reflects higher EBITDA plus gains of GB£137 million  arising from mark to market of unrealised FX options and commodity  hedges and revaluation of foreign currency loans.
This compares to  a GB£47 million loss in FY 2012-13.
PBT also captures depreciation  and amortization charges, up GB£253 million to GB£875 million  for FY 2013-14 given increased product development and facilities  investment.
Higher net finance expense of GB£154 million includes  GB£62 million of one off costs incurred in the redemption of the  higher coupon GB£500 million and US$410 million 2018 notes  (at 8.125% and 7.75% coupon respectively) and a GB£47 million  reversal of gain on related bond call options.
The bond redemption  was pre-financed by the successful issuances of US$700 million  4.125% 2018 notes and GB£400 million 5% 2022 notes.
This served  to reduce JLR’s overall cost of debt in line with the improving credit  and market conditions.
Profit after tax, at an effective rate of 25%, was GB£1,879 million.
Cash Flow  Net cash from operating activities was GB£3,422 million in FY 2013- 14, in line with profits plus positive working capital of GB£393 million  versus GB£382 million in prior period, less tax paid of GB£402 million  (GB£248 million in FY 2012-13).
This compares to operating cash  flow of GB£2,429 million in FY 2012-13.
JLR invested significantly  in the year, up GB£527 million to GB£2,444 million for the year.
This demonstrates JLR’s commitment to product development and  also capacity increases, including facilities in China and the UK.
Net  cash used in financing activities was GB£498 million in FY 2013-14  compared to GB£178 million in FY 2012-13.

Opportunities and Risks – JLR and Tata Motors businesses constitute  Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 90 Financial Statements a significant portion of Revenue, Income and assets / liabilities.
Accordingly, we have given below key opportunities and risks.
OPPORTUNITIES: The new Govern ment at the centre has expressed a mandate of  infrastructure oriented spending for national development.
The  resultant fiscal spending will give a boost to transport & mining  sectors.
Lifting of mining bans is also expected to ramp up through  the year.
Demand for trucks, tippers as well as last mile transport  solutions will go up as economic activity revives.
The changes are  however expected towards the later part of the financial year, given  the time taken to form and execute policies.
FDI is also likely to be opened up, albeit cautiously, including in  sectors like Defence.
The Company is focusing on increasing their  offerings in defence sector from providing only pure logistics  solutions to tactical and combat solutions.
This provides the  opportunity for capturing a larger share in a growing market.
Growing wealth in rural markets in India also provides an added  opportunity to expand sales reach and volumes.
The sales reported  out of areas earlier considered rural is growing year on year.
The  overall gap of automobile purchase between rural and urban areas  is narrowing in India.
The Company is focusing on reaching rural  target market to address the latent need, in cost effective ways With increasing awareness and education of the Indian customer,  a range of non-vehicular products and services like spares, after  sales, annual maintenance contracts etc are also gaining popularity  in demand.
The Company is poised to address this growing need,  thereby providing additional sources of revenue, which are non- cyclical in nature, to hedge for otherwise cyclical demand in the  auto industry.
The growing demands and sensibilities of customers in the ILCV  segment is also something Tata Motors is poised to address with  its new range of vehicles.
The evolving infrastructure in India will  change the way transportation industry matures, with demand  for better quality and more comfortable vehicles.
The company  has already inve sted in new platforms to cater to such evolving  demands.
India has emerged as a major hub for global manufacturing with  its advantage of lower input costs, availability of local supplier  base and high domestic demand.
As an established domestic  manufacturer, the Company is ideally placed to take advantage for  targeting lucrative international markets, either through the fully  built export or CKD route.
In addition to the above, the Company also has the advantage of a  strong in-house design and development facility and professionals.
Thus the Company’s R &D group is capable of developing solutions  for different regulatory and emission norms as per market  specifications in minimal time.
The Company is focusing on increasing its global presence, as an  effective hedge against domestic downturn as well as a growth  opportunity.
While the company is already present in Africa and  some parts of ASEAN, it is focusing on inc reasing presence in more  key markets in ASEAN and LATAM.
The Company is also actively  considering expanding its global manufacturing footprint in key  international markets to take advantage of import duty differentials  and local sourcing benefits.
Jaguar Land Rover Opportunities through products and  markets: JLR offers products in the premium performance car and  all-terrain vehicle segments, and intends to grow the business by  diversifying the product range within these segments.
For instance,  the Range Rover Evoque defined the market segment for smaller,  lighter and more“urban” off road vehicles, complementing the more  mature Range Rover, Freelander and Discovery markets.
Similarly  for Jaguar, the 2.2L Diesel XF caters well for a wide customer  base, notably including the corporate market segment, and theXF  Sportbrake adds a premium estate model to the portfolio, and of  course the Jaguar F TYPE, available in both soft top and now coupé,  provides a vivid representation of the confidence and ambition of  thebrand.
As well as the core product family, various options, such  as long wheel base, smaller engine and all-wheel drive derivatives,  help to strengthen overall product offering.
JLR also has ambitious but robust plans to continue to develop the  product range.
Including the Jaguar XE, the eagerly anticipated mid- sized sedan, and Jaguar crossover based on the C X17 concept and  for Land Rover, the announcement of the Discovery Sport, available  91 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report for sale in 2015 andto be the first in a new family of Discovery’s.
As  well as hybrid and long wheel base derivatives of existing models.
Complementing the new products, JLR intends to also expand its  global footprint, particularly into those emerging, affluent countries  with growing sales potential and appetite for the Company’s  distinctive, premium products.
There are three specific aspects to  JLR’s strategy of geographic expansion:  Increase marketing and dealernetwork in emerging markets.
For example, in China, JLR established an NSC in 2010 to  expand our presence in this key market and have increased  network of sales dealerships to 170 dealerships as at March  31, 2014.
Similarly, JLR expect to continue to grow its presence  in the Indian market by opening additional dealerships across  the country.
Establish new manufacturing facilities, assembly points and  suppliers in selected markets.
This includes a manufacturing  and assembly joint venture in China with Chery Automobile  Company Ltd.; an assembly facility in India operated by  Tata Motors; and amanufacturing facility in Brazil.
JLR also  continues to explore further broadening our manufacturing  base, including opportunities in Saudi Arabia.
Leverage relationship with Tata Motors and the synergies we  can achieve in the areas of research and product development,  supply sourcing, manufacturing and assembly and other  operations.
RISKS: Deterioration in global economic conditions:  The automotive  industry, and the demand for automobiles, is influenced by  general economic conditions, including among other things, rates  of economic growth, availability of credit, disposable income of  consumers, interest rates, environmental and tax policies, safety  regulations, freight rates and fuel and commodity prices.
Negative  trends in any of these factors impacting the regions where the  Company operates could materially and adversely affect our  business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Indian automotive industry is affected materially by the  general economic conditions in India and around the world.
Muted industrial growth in India during FY 2013-14 along with  continuing higher inflation and interest rates continue to pose  risks to overall growth in this market.
The automotive industry in  general is cyclical and economic slowdowns in the recent past have  affected the manufacturing sector including the automotive and  related industries in India.
Persistence of negative economic trends  or further deterioration in key economic factors such as growth  rate, interest rates and inflation as well as reduced availability of  financing for vehicles at competitive rates could materially and  adversely affect the Company automotive sales in India and results  of operations.
Jaguar Land Rover business has significant operations in the United  Kingdom, North America, continental Europe and China, as well  as sales operations in many major countries across the globe.
The global economic downturn significantly impacted the global  automotive markets, particularly in the United States and Europe,  including the United Kingdom, where Jaguar Land Rover operations  have significant sales exposure.
During Fiscal 2014, the automotive  market in the United Kingdom and Europe continued to experience  challenges.
Confidence in financial markets and general consumer  confidence have been further eroded by recent political tensions  in North Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine, and concerns of an  economic slowdown in China.
Strategy with respect to Jaguar  Land Rover operations, which includes new product launches and  expansion in growing markets such as China, India, Russia and  Brazil, may not be sufficient to mitigate the decrease in demand  for our products in established markets and this could have a  significant adverse impact on our financial performance.
If industry  demand softens because of lower or negative economic growth in  key markets, including China, or other factors, results of operations  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
Economic outlook in India:  The Indian automotive industry is  affected substantially by the general economic conditions in India  and around the world.
The demand for automobiles in the Indian  market is influenced by factors including the growth rate of the  Indian economy, easy availability of credit, and increase in disposable  income among Indian consumers, interest rates, freight rates and  fuel prices.
Demand for automobiles, particularly passenger vehicles  and commercial vehicles were adversely impacted during FY 2013- 14 due to lower GDP growth, high interest rates and high fuel prices.
During FY 2013-14, RBI increased the key policy rates by 75 basis  Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 92 Financial Statements points to control inflation.
Interest rates remained firm thus making  it difficult to purchase consumer durable items on finance.
High  costs of borrowing and elevated consumer price inflation adversely  affected household consumer sentiment and spending.
On the  other hand, slowdown in GDP growth has been due to decline  in both consumption and investment growth.
Investments were   stalled because of high interest rates, poor demand conditions,  and regulatory issues.
While mining output declined on a year- on-year basis owing to policy, clearance and legal obstructions,  the decline in capital goods production was due to a downturn in  the investment cycle.
Consumer durables sector performance was  affected adversely by low income growth, elevated interest rates,  and subdued consumer sentiment.
From 4.8% of GDP in FY 2012- 13, current account deficit during the first three quarters of FY 2013- 14 (April-December) remained around 2.3% of GDP .
This has led to  hardening of rupee and fuel prices remained firm.
The automotive  industry in general is cyclical and economic slowdowns in the past  have affected the manufacturing sector including the automotive  and related industries.
Input Costs / Supplies: Prices of commodity items used in  manufacturing automobiles, including steel, aluminium, copper,  zinc, rubber, platinum, palladium and rhodium have become  increasingly volatile in recent years.
Further price movements  would closely depend on the evolving economic scenarios across  the globe.
While the Company continues to pursue cost reduction  initiatives, an increase in price of input materials could severely  impact the Company’s profitability to the extent such increase  cannot be absorbed by the market through price increases and  / or could have a negative impact on the demand.
In addition,  because of intense price competition high level of fixed costs,  the Company may not be able to adequately address changes  in commodity prices even if they are foreseeable.
Increases  in fuel costs also pose a significant challenge to automobile  manufacturers worldwide including the Company, especially in  the commercial and premium vehicle segments where increased  fuel prices have an impact on demand.
Restrictive covenants in financing agreements: Some of the  Company’s financing agreements and debt arrangements set  limits on and/or require the Company to obtain lender consents  before, among other things, pledging assets as security.
In addition,  certain financial covenants may limit the Company’s ability to  borrow additional funds or to incur additional liens.
In the past, the  Company has been able to obtain required lender consents for such  activities.
However there can be no assurance that the Company  will be able to obtain such consents in the future.
If the financial  or growth plans require such consents and such consents are not  obtained, the Company may be forced to forego or alter plans,  which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations  and financial condition.
In the event that the Company breach these covenants, the  outstanding amounts under such financing agreements could  become due and payable immediately and/or resulting in increased  costs.
A default under one of these financing agreements may also  result in cross-defaults under other financing agreements and result  in the outstanding amounts under such other financing agreements  becoming due and payable immediately.
Defaults under one or  more of financing agreements could have a material adverse effect  on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Environmental Regulations: The automotive industry is subject  to extensive Governmental regulations regarding vehicle emission  levels, noise, safety and levels of pollutants generated by the  production facilities.
These regulations are likely to become more  stringent and compliance costs may significantly impact the  future results of operations.
In particular, the US and Europe have  stringent regulations relating to vehicular emissions.
The proposed  tightening of vehicle emissions regulations by the European Union  will require significant costs for compliance.
While the Company  is pursuing various technologies in order to meet the required  standards in the various countries in which the Company sell its  vehicles, the costs for compliance with these required standards  can be significant to the operations and may adversely impact the  results of operations.
To comply with current and future environmental norms, the  Company may have to incur additional capital expenditure  and R&D expenditure to upgrade products and manufacturing  facilities, which would have an impact on the Company’s cost of  production and the results of operations and may be difficult to  pass through to its customers.
If the Company is unable to develop  commercially viable technologies within the time frames set by the  new standards, the Company could face significant civil penalties  93 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report or be forced to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in  compliance.
Moreover, meeting Government mandated safety  standards is difficult and costly because crash worthiness standards  tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to  meet emissions and fuel economy standards.
Intensifying Competition: The global automotive industry is highly  competitive and competition is intense in view of the continuing  globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive  industry.
Competition is especially likely to increase in the premium  automotive categories as each market participant intensifies its  efforts to retain its position in established markets while also  developing a presence in emerging markets, such as China, India,  Russia, Brazil and parts of Asia.
The factors affecting competition  include product quality and features, innovation and time to  introduce new product, ability to control costs, pricing, reliability,  safety, fuel economy, environmental impact and perception thereof,  customer service and financing terms.
The Company faces strong competition in the Indian market  from domestic as well as foreign automobile manufacturers.
Improving infrastructure and robust growth prospects compared  to other mature markets, have attracted a number of international  companies to India either through joint ventures with local partners  or through independently owned operations in India.
International  competitors bring with them decades of international experience,  global scale, advanced technology and significant financial  resources.
Consequently, domestic competition is likely to further  intensify in the future.
Exchange and interest rate fluctuations: The Company’s operations  are subject to risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates with  reference to countries in which it operates.
The Company imports capital equipment, raw materials and  components from, manufactures vehicles in, and sells vehicles  into, various countries, and therefore its revenues and cost have  significant exposure to the relative movements of the GBP , the  US dollar, the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Russian Ruble, the  Japanese Yen and the Indian Rupee.
In particular the Indian Rupee decline significantly relative to  the US dollar during FY 2013-14.
Moreover, the Company has  outstanding foreign currency denominated debt and is sensitive  to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company  has experienced and expects to continue to experience foreign  exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign  currencies in respect of its borrowings and foreign currency assets  and liabilities due to currency fluctuations.
JLR has outstanding  USD denominated debt and is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign  currency exchange rates.
The Company also has interest-bearing assets (including cash  balances) and interest bearing liabilities, which bear interest at  variable rates.
The Company is therefore exposed to changes in  interest rates in the various markets in which it borrows.
Although the Tata Motors group engage in managing our interest  and foreign exchange exposure through use of financial hedging  instruments such as forward contracts, swap agreements and  option contracts, adverse interest rates and a weakening of the  Indian rupee against major foreign currencies may have an adverse  effect on cost of borrowing, which could have a significant adverse  impact on the Company’s results of operations.
New products, emissions and technology: The competitors  can gain significant advantages if they are able to offer products  satisfying customer needs earlier than the Company is able to and  this could adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of  operations.
Unanticipated delays or cost overruns in implementing  new product launches, expansion plans or capacity enhancements  could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.
Customer preferences especially in many of the developed  markets seem to be moving in favour of more fuel efficient and  environmentally friendly vehicles.
Further, in many countries there  has been significant pressure on the automotive industry to reduce  carbon dioxide emissions.
In many markets these preferences are  driven by increased Government regulation and rising fuel prices  and customers environmental considerations.
The Company’s  operations may be significantly impacted if the Company  experience delays in developing fuel efficient products that  reflect changing customer preferences, especially in the premium  automotive category.
Further a deterioration in the quality of the  Company’s vehicle could force it to incur substantial cost and  damage its reputation.
Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 94 Financial Statements Underperformance of distribution channels and supply chains:  The Company products are sold and serviced through a network of  authorized dealers and service centers across the domestic market,  and a network of distributors and local dealers in international  markets.
The Company monitors the performance of its dealers  and distributors and provides them with support to enable them  to perform to the expectations.
Any under-performance by the  dealers or distributors could adversely affect the Company’s sales  and results of operations.
The Company relies on third parties to supply raw materials, parts and  components used in the manufacture of products.
Furthermore, for  some of these parts and components, the Company is dependent  on a single source.
The Company’s ability to procure supplies in a  cost effective and timely manner is subject to various factors, some  of which are not within its control.
While the Company manages  its supply chain as part of the vendor management process, any  significant problems with supply chain in the future could affect the  results of operations.
Natural disasters and man-made accidents,  adverse economic conditions, decline in automobile demand, lack  of access to sufficient financing arrangements among others could  have a negative financial impact on the Company’s suppliers and  distributors, in turn impairing timely availability of components,  or increases in costs of components Similarly, impairments to the  financial condition of our distributors may adversely impact our  performance in some markets.
In addition, if one or more of the  other global automotive manufacturers were to become insolvent,  this would have an adverse effect on the supply chains and may  further affect the Company’s results of operations in an adverse  manner.
With respect to JLR operations, as part of a separation agreement  from Ford, the Company has entered into supply agreements  with Ford and certain other third parties for critical components.
Any disruption of such transitional services could have a material  adverse impact on the operations and financial condition.
Changes in tax, tariff or fiscal policies and regulations:   Imposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to limit  the use of automobiles could adversely affect the demand for  the Company‘s vehicles and the results of operations.
Changes in  corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export  and other incentives given by the various Governments could  also adversely affect the results of operations.
For example, the  Company benefits from excise duty exemptions for manufacturing  facilities in the State of Uttarakhand and other incentives in certain  states of India either through subsidies or loans from such states  where it has manufacturing operations.
The Government of India  had proposed a comprehensive national goods and services tax, or  GST, regime that will combine taxes and levies by the central and  state Governments into one unified rate structure.
While both the  Government of India and other state Governments of India have  publicly announced that all committed incentives will be protected  following the implementation of the GST, given the limited  availability of information in the public domain concerning the  GST the Company is unable to provide any assurance as to this and  any of the aspect of tax regime following implementation of the  GST.
The implementation of this rationalized tax structure might be  affected by any disagreement between certain state Governments,  which could create uncertainty.
The timelines of the proposed  transition is uncertain at this point of time.
The Direct Tax Code Bill 2010, or DTC, proposes to replace the  existing Income Tax Act, 1961 and other direct tax laws, with a view  to simplify and rationalize the tax provisions into one unified code.
The various proposals included in DTC bill are subject to review by  Indian parliament and as such impact if any, is not quantifiable at  this stage.
Political instability, wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts,  natural disasters, fuel shortages / prices, epidemics, labour  strikes: The Company’s products are exported to a number  of geographical markets and the Company plans to expand  international operations further in the future.
Consequently, the  Company is subject to various risks associated with conducting  the business outside the domestic market and the operations may  be subject to political instability in those markets, wars, terrorism,  regional and / or multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel  shortages, epidemics and labour strikes.
In addition, conducting  business internationally, especially in emerging markets, exposes  the Company to additional risks, including adverse changes  in economic and Government policies, unpredictable shifts in  regulation, inconsistent application of existing laws and regulations,  unclear regulatory and taxation systems and divergent commercial  and employment practices and procedures.
Any significant or  95 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report prolonged delay in the Company’s operations related to these risks  could impact its results of operations.
Product liability, warranty and recall: The Company is subject  to risks and costs associated with product liability, warranties and  recalls, should the Company supply defective products, parts,  or related after-sales services, including by generating negative  publicity, which may adversely affect the Company’s business, results  of operations and financial conditions.
Such events also require the  Company, to expend considerable resources in correcting these  problems and could adversely affect the demand for the products.
The Company may also be subject to class actions or other large  scale product liability or other lawsuits in various jurisdictions where  it has a significant presen ce.
Jaguar Land Rover Pension obligations: The Company provides  post-retirement and pension benefits to its employees, some of  which are defined benefit plans.
The pension liabilities are generally  funded and the pension plan assets are particularly significant in  respect the JLR Pension plan.
All new employees in the operations  from April 19, 2010, have joined a new defined contribution   pension plan.
Lower return on pension fund assets, changes in market conditions,  changes in interest rates, changes in inflation rates and adverse  changes in other critical actuarial assumptions, may impact its  pension liabilities and consequently increase funding requirements,  which will adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and  results of operations.
Automobile financing business and selling arrangements: In  India the Company is subject to risks associated with its automobile  financing business carried out by its subsidiary Tata Motor Finance  Ltd.
In order to support the sale of its vehicle.
Any defaults by the  customers or inability to repay installments as due, could adversely  affect the Company’s business, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings may  increase the borrowing costs and restrict the access to the debt  markets.
Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit  rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory  changes or otherwise, the Company may need to reduce the  amount of financing receivables it originates, which could adversely  affect the ability to support the sale of vehicles.
Jaguar Land Rover has consumer finance arrangements in place  with local providers in a number of key markets.
Any reduction in  the supply of available consumer financing for purchase of new  vehicles could create additional pressures to increase marketing  incentives in order to maintain demand for its vehicles, which could  materially and adversely affect the Company’s sales and results of  operations.
Further, Jaguar Land Rover also offers residual value  guarantees on the leases of certain vehicles in some markets.
Any  adverse movement in used car valuation could impact our result  of operations.
Labour unrest: The Company’s permanent employees, other  than officers and managers, in India and most of the permanent  employees in South Korea and the United Kingdom, including  certain officers and managers, in relation to automotive business, are  members of labour unions and are covered by wage agreements,  where applicable with those labour unions.
In general, the Company considers labour relations with all of  employees to be good.
However, in the future the Company may be  subject to labour unrest, which may delay or disrupt the operations  in the affected regions, including the acquisition of raw materials  and parts, the manufacture, sales and distribution of products and  the provision of services.
If work stoppages or lock-outs at the  Company’s facilities or at the facilities of the major vendors occur or  continue for a long period of time, the business, financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected.
JLR operations in key mature market: JLR, which contributes  large portion of the Company’s consolidated revenues, generate  a significant portion of its sales in the United Kingdom, North  American, continental European markets where the automotive  industry was severely impacted during the global economic  downturn in FY 2008-09.
Even though sales of passenger cars in  certain of these markets were aided by Government-sponsored  car-scrap incentives, these incentives primarily benefited the  compact and micro-compact car segments and had virtually no  slowing effect on the sales declines in the premium car or all- terrain vehicle segments, in which JLR operates.
Although demand  in these markets has recovered strongly, any decline in demand for  the Company’s vehicles in these major markets may in the future  significantly impair the Company’s business, financial position and  results of operations.
In addition the Company’s strategy, which  includes new product launches and further expansion into growing  Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 96 Financial Statements markets, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, may not be sufficient  to mitigate a decrease in demand for the Company’s products in  mature markets in the future which could have a significant effect  on the Company’s financial performances.
Growing business through mergers and acquisitions: The  Company believes that its acquisitions provide opportunities to  grow significantly in the global automobile markets by offering  premium brands and products.
The acquisitions have provided  access to technology and additional capabilities while also offering  potential synergies.
However, the scale, scope and nature of the  integration required in connection with acquisitions, present  significant challenges, and the Company may be unable to integrate  the relevant subsidiaries, divisions and facilities effectively within the  expected schedule.
An acquisition may not meet the Company’s  expectations and the realization of the anticipated benefits may be  blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of numerous factors, some  of which are outside the Company’s control.
The Company will continue to evaluate growth opportunities  through suitable mergers and acquisitions in the future.
Growth  through mergers and acquisitions involves business risks, including  unforeseen contingent risks or latent business liabilities that may  only become apparent after the merger or acquisition is completed.
The key success factors will be seamless integration and effective  management of the merged/acquired entity, retention of key  personnel, and generating cash flow from synergies in engineering  and sourcing, joint sales and marketing efforts, and management  of a larger business.
Business is seasonal in nature: The sales volumes and prices  for the Company’s vehicles are influenced by the cyclicality and  seasonality of demand for these products.
The automotive industry  has been cyclical in the past and the Company expects this  cyclicality to continue.
In the Indian market, demand for vehicles  generally peaks between January and March, although there is a  decrease in demand in February just before release of the Indian  fiscal budget.
Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up  again in the festival season from September onwards, with a decline  in December due to year-end.
JLR business is impacted by the bi-annual registration of vehicles  in the UK where the vehicle registration number changes every  six months, which in turn has an impact on the resale value of  vehicles.
This leads to an increase in sales during the period when  the aforementioned change occurs.
Most other markets such as the  United States are driven by introduction of new model year products  which typically occurs in the autumn of each year.
Furthermore,  western European markets tend to be impacted by the summer  and winter holidays.
Markets in China tend to show higher demand  for vehicles around the Chinese New Year.
The summer and winter  shutdowns of manufacturing plants also have a significant seasonal  impact on the Company’s cash flows.
The resulting sales profile  influences operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Inability to protect or preserve  intellectual property: With  respect to JLR, the Company owns or otherwise has rights to  a number of patents relating to the products the Company  manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years.
In  connection with the design and engineering of new vehicles and the  enhancement of existing models, the Company seeks to regularly  develop new technical designs for use in its vehicles.
The Company  also uses technical designs which are the intellectual property of  third parties with such third parties’ consent.
These patents and  trademarks have been of value in the growth of the business and  may continue to be of value in the future.
Although the Company  does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon  any single patent or related group of patents, an inability to protect  this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some  or a large group of our intellectual property rights, would have a  materially adverse effect on the Company’s operations, business  and / or financial condition.
The Company may also be affected by  restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights held by third  parties and it may be held legally liable for the infringement of the  intellectual property rights of others in its products.
Inability to manage growing international business: The  Company’s growth strategy relies on the expansion of its operations  by introducing certain automotive products in other parts of the  world, including Europe, China, Russia, Brazil, the US, Africa, and other  parts of Asia.
The costs associated with entering and establishing in  new markets, and expanding such operations, may be higher than  expected, and the Company may face significant competition in  those regions.
In addition, the Company’s international business is  subject to many actual and potential risks and challenges, including  97 Notice Directors’ Report (69-103) Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report language barriers, cultural differences and other difficulties in  staffing and managing overseas operations, inherent difficulties and  delays in contract enforcement and the collection of receivables  under the legal systems of some foreign countries, the risk of non- tariff barriers, other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  sanctions, and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of  foreign laws and regulations.
Insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us  against all potential losses: While the Company believes that  the insurance coverage that it maintain is reasonably adequate to  cover all normal risks associated with the operation of its business,  there can be no assurance that insurance will be sufficient, that any  claim under insurance policies will be honored fully or timely or  that the insurance premium will not increase substantially.
To the  extent that the Company, suffer loss or damage that is not covered  by insurance or which exceeds the insurance coverage or are  required to pay higher insurance premium the Company’s financial  condition may be affected.
Disruption in the manufacturing, design and engineering  facilities: The Company has manufacturing facilities and design and  engineering centres, located in India, the UK, South Korea, Thailand,  and South Africa and have established a presence in Indonesia.
The  Company could experience disruption to its manufacturing, design  and engineering capabilities for a variety of reasons, including,  among others, extreme weather, fire, theft, system failures, natural  catastrophes, mechanical or equipment failures and similar risks.
Any  significant disruptions could adversely affect the Company’s ability  to design, manufacture and sell the Company’s products and, if any  of those events were to occur, the Company cannot be certain that  the Company would be able to shift i ts design, engineering and  manufacturing operations to alternative sites in a timely manner  or at all.
Any such disruption could therefore materially affect the  Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of production facilities: The Company’s production  facilities are subject to a wide range of environmental, health and  safety requirements.
These requirements address, among other  things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, accidental releases  into the environment, human exposure to hazardous materials,  storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of wastes and  hazardous materials, investigation and c leanup of contamination,  process safety and maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace.
Many of the Company’s operations require permits and controls  to monitor or prevent pollution.
The Company has incurred, and  will continue to incur, substantial on-going capital and operating  expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future  environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or their more  stringent enforcement.
Other environmental, health and safety laws  and regulations could impose restrictions or onerous conditions on  the availability or the use of raw materials the Company need for  the Company’s manufacturing process.
For JLR operations, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, an EU-wide  system in which allowances to emit greenhouse gases are issued  and traded, is anticipated to cover more industrial facilities and  become progressively more stringent over time, including by  reducing the number of allowances that will be allocated free of  cost to manufacturing facilities.
In addition, a number of further  legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas  emissions, including national laws and the Kyoto Protocol, are in  various phases of discussion or implementation.
These measures  could result in increased costs to: (i) operate and maintain the  Company’s production facilities; (ii) install new emissions controls  or reduction technologies; (iii) purchase or otherwise obtain  allowances to emit greenhouse gases; and (iv) administer and  manage the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions programmes.
Inability to attract and retain skills: The Company believes that  the Company’s growth and future success depend largely on the  skills of the Company’s workforce, including executives and officers,  as well as the designers and engineers and the attraction of critical  skills.
The loss of the services of one or more of these employees  could impair the C ompany’s ability to continue to implement its  business strategy.
The Company’s success also depends, in part, on  its continued ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified  employees, particularly qualified engineers with expertise in  automotive design and production.
In view of intense competition  and the Company’s inability to continue to attract, retain and  motivate employees could adversely affect its business and plans  to invest in the development of new designs and products.
Operational risks, including risks in the connection with the  use of information technology: Operational risk is the risk of loss  resulting from inadequa te or failed internal processes, people and  Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 98 Financial Statements systems or from external events.
This includes, among other things,  losses that are caused by lack of controls within internal procedures,  violation of internal policies by employees, disruption or malfunction  of IT systems, computer networks and telecommunication systems,  mechanical or equipment failures, human error, natural disasters or  malicious acts by third parties.
Any unauthorized access to or misuse  of data processed on our IT systems, human errors associated with  therewith or technological failures of any kind could disrupt the  Company’s operations, including the manufacturing, design and  engineering processes and, consequently the Company’s financial  conditions.
Deterioration in the performance of any of our subsidiaries,  joint ventures and affiliates: The Company has made and may  continue to make capital commitments to subsidiaries, joint  ventures and affiliates, and if the business or operations of any  of these subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates deteriorates, the  value of the Company’s investments may be adversely affected.
OUTLOOK While the start of the new fiscal has continued from the moderate  performance of last year, there is a cautious optimism that FY 2014- 15 would see the start of the revival in the global and domestic  economies.
The Indian economy is also expected to look up  marginally from growth in GDP of 5% in the last year.
Growth in first half of FY 2014-15 is unlikely to be much different  than in FY 2013-14 as industrial and services sector growth is still  weak.
It is expected to be in the range 5% to 5.5%.
A new stable Government will take steps to improve investor  confidence and thereby leading to revival of economy in the  second half of FY 2014-15.
M&HCV truck sales, which are reflective  of the economic sentiment, have seen an arrest in the declining  trend in the start of the new fiscal.
Infrastructure spending as well  as regulation in areas like mining is expected to receive a positive  shot in the arm While current account deficit is under control, fiscal deficit will  continue to be priority for the Gove rnment and striking a balance  between controlling expenditure and encouraging growth will be  key for this year.
On the background of pressure on volumes in India and limited  headroom in pricing due to the intensely competitive market  dynamics, the focus will be on effective cost management- both  direct and indirect to maintain margins.
Even in this challenging  environment, as envisioned in its Mission statement, the Company  is looking to ‘passionately anticipate’ and provide vehicles and  solutions that ‘excite customers globally’ .
The objective remains to  be the ‘most admired’ Company by all our stakeholders.
One of the key elements of this strategy would be to improve the  relationship with the customer – the experience the customer has  with the Company at each touch point from sale to service and  replacement sales experiences.
This would include improving the  physical look of the setup, setting up right processes and forums  for speedy resolution of customer issues.
The Company will also actively pursue growth in the right  International markets and look to consolidate its position in markets  where it is already present.
While Europe remains uncertain in the short term, JLR will continue  to focus on growth from other markets, in particular the emerging  markets.
With entry been established in China last year, growing and  consolidating presence in this market would be key to JLR’s strategy  for the coming year.
Investment in new products and technologies  along with enhancing capacity as required in the right geographies  would continue for both Jaguar and Land Rover.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY The Company has an adequate system of internal controls in place.
It has documented policies and procedures covering all financial  and operating functions.
These controls have been designed to  provide a reasonable assurance with regard to maintaining of proper  accounting controls for ensuring reliability of financial reporting,  monitoring of operations, protecting assets from unauthorized  use or losses, compliances with regulations.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Accounting Standards  notified under the Companies Act, 1956 (“the Act”) (which continue  to be applicable in respect of Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 in terms of  General Circular 15/2013 dated September 13, 2013 of the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs) and in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and  maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In  making those risk assessments, the auditor considers  internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the   Company’s  internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting  estimates made by the Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the  aforesaid financial statements give the information required  by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India: (a) in the case of the Balance Sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2014; (b) in the case of the Statement of Profit and Loss, of the profit of the Company for the year ended on that date; and (c) in the case of the Cash Flow Statement, of the cash flows of the Company for the year ended on that date.

According to the information and explanation given to us,  no material discrepancies were noticed on such verification;   (c) The fixed assets disposed off during the year, in our opinion, do not constitute a substantial part of the fixed assets of the Company and such  disposal has, in our opinion, not affected the going concern status of the Company.

(c) The receipts of principal amounts have been as per stipulations.
However, there are delays in receipt of interest.
(d) In respect of overdue interest amounts of over Rs.
1 lakh remaining outstanding as at the year-end, as explained to us, Management has taken  reasonable steps for recovery of the interest amount.

(b)  Use of estimates      The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of these  financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected.
(c)  Revenue recognition    The Company recognises revenues on the sale of products, net of discounts and sales incentives, when the products are delivered to the dealer /  customer or when delivered to the carrier for export sales, which is when risks and rewards of ownership pass to the dealer / customer.
Sales include income from services,  and exchange fluctuations relating to export receivables.
Sales include export and other recurring and non- recurring incentives from the Government at the national and state levels.
Sale of products is presented gross of excise duty where applicable, and  net of other indirect taxes.
Revenues are recognised when collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured.
Dividend from investments is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established and when no significant uncertainty as to  measurability or collectability exists.
Interest income is recognized on the time basis determined by the amount outstanding and the rate applicable and where no significant uncertainty  as to measurability or collectability exists.
(d)  Depreciation and amortisation    (i) Depreciation is provided on Straight Line Method (SLM), at the rates and in the manner prescribed in Schedule XIV to the Companies    Act, 1956 except in the case of :       • Leasehold Land – amortised over the period of the lease      • Technical Know-how – at 16.67% (SLM)     • Laptops – at 23.75% (SLM)      • Cars – at 23.75% (SLM)     • Assets acquired prior to April 1, 1975 – on Written Down Value basis at rates specified in Schedule XIV to the Companies Act,     1956.

(ii) Product development costs are amortised over a period of 36 months to 120 months or on the basis of actual production to planned    production volume over such period.
(iii) In respect of assets whose useful life has been revised, the unamortised depreciable amount has been charged over the revised    remaining useful life.
(iv) Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and asset is ready for its    intended use.
(v) Capital assets, the ownership of which does not vest with the Company, other than leased assets, are depreciated over the estimated    period of their utility or five years, whichever is less.
(e)  Fixed assets   (i) Fixed assets are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation / amortization and accumulated    impairment, if any.
(ii) Product development cost incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognised as fixed assets,    when feasibility has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other resources to complete the    development and it is probable that asset will generate future benefits.
(iii) Cost includes purchase price, taxes and duties, labour cost and directly attributable overhead expenditure for self constructed assets    incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use.
Borrowing cost incurred for qualifying assets is capitalised up to the date    the asset is ready for intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate    of all other borrowings, if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
The cost of acquisition is further adjusted for    exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency borrowings attributable to the acquisition of depreciable asset w.e.f.
April    1, 2007.
(iv) Software not exceeding `25,000 and product development costs relating to minor product enhancements, facelifts and upgrades are    charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.
(f ) Impairment    At each Balance Sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that the fixed assets with finite lives may be impaired.
If any such  NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 135 indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where it is not possible  to estimate the recoverable amount of individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the  asset belongs.
As of March 31, 2014 none of the fixed assets were considered impaired.
(g) Leases   (i) Finance lease     Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair    value of the assets and the  present  value of minimum lease payments.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the    lease term so as to produce a constant  periodic rate of  interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets given under finance    leases are recognised as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and the finance income is based on a    constant rate of return on the outstanding net investment.
(ii) Operating lease     Leases other than finance lease, are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet.
Payments under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Exchange differences considered as borrowing     cost are capitalized to the extent these relate to the acquisition / construction of qualifying assets and the balance amount is     recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(2) Exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency monetary assets / liabilities are accounted for with effect from April     1, 2007 in the following manner:     - Differences relating to borrowings attributable to the acquisition of the depreciable capital asset are added to / deducted from      the cost of such capital assets.
- Other differences are accumulated in Foreign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account, to be amortized over      the period, beginning April 1, 2007 or date of inception of such item, as applicable, and ending on March 31, 2011 or the date      of its maturity, whichever is earlier.
- Pursuant to notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on December 29, 2011, the exchange differences on long      term foreign currency monetary items (other than those relating to acquisition of depreciable assets) are amortised over the      period till the date of maturity or March 31, 2020, whichever is earlier.
(ii) Hedge accounting     The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to    highly probable forecast transactions.
With effect from April 1, 2008, the Company designates such forward contracts in a cash flow    hedging relationship by applying the hedge accounting principles set out in Accounting Standard 30- Financial Instruments:    Recognition and Measurement.
These forward contracts are stated at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of these forward and option contracts    that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in Hedging Reserve Account under    Reserves and Surplus, net of applicable deferred income taxes and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit    and Loss.
Amounts accumulated in Hedging Reserve Account are reclassified to Profit and Loss in the periods during which the forecasted    transaction occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies    for hedge accounting.
For forecasted transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Hedging    Reserve Account is retained there until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Hedging Reserve Account    is immediately transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Foreign currency options and other derivatives are stated at fair value as    at the year end with changes in fair value recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the  consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from  material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s  preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
An audit  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the  Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
As stated in the Other Matters paragraph below, our opinion, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of the subsidiaries,  jointly controlled entity and associates not audited by us, is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of the reports of the  other auditors on the financial statements of the subsidiaries, and associates and based on the consideration of the unaudited financial statements  of the subsidiaries, jointly controlled entity and associates; referred to below in the Other Matters paragraph, the aforesaid consolidated financial  statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India: a) in the case of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, of the state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2014; b) in the case of the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, of the profit of the Group for the year ended on that date; and c) in the case of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, of the cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.
Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to Note k (i) under significant accounting policies.
As stated in the note, the changes in actuarial valuation (net) amounting to  R1,343.67 crores (debit) (net of tax of R40.39 crores) for the year ended March 31, 2014 and R7,568.38 crores (debit) as at March 31, 2014, have been  accounted in “Reserves and Surplus” in respect of a group of subsidiary companies.
Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.
171 (170-171) Other Matters a)  We did not audit the financial statements of 12 subsidiaries whose financial statements reflect total assets (net) of R62,024.11 crores as at  March 31, 2014, total revenues of R1,96,754.68 crores and net cash inflows amounting to R4,075.15 crores for the year ended on that date, as  considered in the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements also include the Group’s share of net profit of R9.71  crores for the year ended March 31, 2014, as considered in the consolidated financial statements, in respect of 2 associates, whose financial  statements have not been audited by us.
These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished  to us by the Management and our opinion, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries and  associates, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
b) The consolidated financial statements include the unaudited financial statements of 7 subsidiaries and 1 jointly controlled entity, whose financial  statements reflect total assets (net) of R438.21 crores as at March 31, 2014, total revenue of R2,438.99 crores and net cash outflows amounting  to R110.90 crores for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements  also include the Group’s share of net loss of R71.01 crores for the year ended March 31, 2014, as considered in the consolidated financial  statements, in respect of 2 associates, based on their unaudited financial statements.

Basis of Consolidation and Significant Accounting Policies  (I) Basis of consolidation:   The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to Tata Motors Limited (the Company), its subsidiary companies, joint ventures and associates.
The Company  and its subsidiaries constitute the Group.
(a) Basis of preparation      The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis of accounting in accordance with the generally accepted  accounting principles, Accounting Standards notified under Section 211 (3C) of the Companies Act, 1956 (the “Act”) and the relevant provisions thereof,  which continue to be applicable in respect of Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 in terms of General Circular 15/2013 dated September 13, 2013 of  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.
(b) Use of estimates       The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of these financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected.
(c) Principles of consolidation:     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:     i.
The financial statements of the subsidiary companies / joint ventures / associates used in the consolidation are drawn upto the same reporting  date as of the Company i.e.
year ended March 31, 2014.     ii.
The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like  items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The intra-group balances and intra-group transactions and unrealised profits have been fully  eliminated.
iii.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the share of profit / loss of the associate companies which has been accounted as per the ‘Equity  method’ , and accordingly, the share of profit / loss of each of the associate companies (the loss being restricted to the cost of investment) has  been added to / deducted from the cost of investments.
An associate is an enterprise in which the investor has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the investor.
iv.
The financial statements of the joint venture companies have been combined by using proportionate consolidation method and accordingly,  venturer’s share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entity is reported as separate line items in the  Consolidated Financial Statements.
v.  The excess of cost to the Company of its investments in the subsidiary companies / joint ventures over its share of equity of the subsidiary  companies / joint ventures, at the dates on which the investments in the subsidiary companies / joint ventures are made, is recognised as  ‘Goodwill’ being an asset in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Alternatively, where the share of equity in the subsidiary companies / joint  ventures as on the date of investment is in excess of cost of investment of the Company, it is recognised as ‘Capital Reserve’ and shown under  the head ‘Reserves and Surplus’ , in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
vi.
Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries consists of the amount of equity attributable to the minority shareholders at  the dates on which investments are made by the Company in the subsidiary companies and further movements in their share in the equity,  subsequent to the dates of investments as stated above.
(d) The following subsidiary companies are considered in the Consolidated Financial Statements: % of holding either directly or through subsidiaries Sr No.

The cost of acquisition is further adjusted for exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency  borrowings attributable to the acquisition of depreciable asset w.e.f.
April 1, 2007.
(iv)  Software not exceeding Rs.
25,000 and product development costs relating to minor product enhancements, facelifts and upgrades are charged off to  the Profit and Loss Statement as and when incurred.
(d) Impairment of Tangible Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill         At each Balance Sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that the tangible assets, intangible assets including Goodwill may be  impaired.
If any such impairment indicators exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where it  is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which  the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to  reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that unit  and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of carrying amount of each asset  in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period unless there are changes in external events.
As of March 31, 2014  none of the tangible and intangible assets were considered impaired except for amounts disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
179  (e) Leases             (i) Finance lease       Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the present value of minimum  lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to periods  during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets given under finance leases are recognised  as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and the finance income is based on a constant rate of return on the outstanding  net investment.
(ii) Operating lease      Leases other than finance lease ,are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet.
Payments under  operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(f) Transactions in foreign currencies and accounting of derivatives  (i) Exchange differences   Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and  liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates.
(1)  Exchange differences arising on settlement of transactions and translation of monetary items other than those covered by (2) below are recognised as  income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Exchange differences considered as borrowing cost are capitalised to the extent these relate to the  acquisition / construction of qualifying assets and the balance amount is recognised in the Statement of Profit & Loss.
(2)  Exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency monetary assets / liabilities are accounted for with effect from April 1, 2007 in the following  manner:     -  Differences relating to borrowings attributable to the acquisition of the depreciable capital asset are added to / deducted from the cost of such  capital assets.
-  Other differences are accumulated in Foreign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account, to be amortised over the period,  beginning April 1, 2007 or date of inception of such item, as applicable, and ending on March 31, 2011 or the date of its maturity, whichever is  earlier.
-  Pursuant to notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, on December 29, 2011, the exchange differences on long term foreign  currency monetary items (other than those relating to acquisition of depreciable asset) are amortised over the period till the date of maturity or  March 31, 2020, whichever is earlier.
(3)  On consolidation, the assets, liabilities and goodwill or capital reserve arising on the acquisition, of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange  rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expenditure items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year/month.
Exchange differences  arising in case of Integral Foreign operations are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and exchange differences arising in case of Non integral Foreign  Operations are recognised in the Group’s Translation Reserve classified under Reserves and surplus.
(ii) Hedge accounting   The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast  transactions.
With effect from April 1, 2008, the Company designates such forward contracts in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge  accounting principles set out in Accounting Standard 30- Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These forward contracts are stated at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts that are designated and effective  as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in Hedging Reserve Account under Reserves and Surplus, net of applicable deferred income taxes and  the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Amounts accumulated in Hedging Reserve Account are reclassified to profit and loss in the same periods during which the forecasted transaction affects  Statement of Profit and Loss   Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
For  forecasted transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is retained there until the forecasted  transaction occurs.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is immediately  transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Foreign currency options and other derivatives are stated at fair value as at the year end with change in fair  value recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(iii) Premium or discount on forward contracts other than those covered in (ii) above is amortised over the life of such contracts and is recognised as income and expense.
(g) Product warranty expenses   The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold.
These estimates are established using historical information on the nature,  frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product failures.
The  timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise - being typically upto five years.
(h) Income on vehicle loan   Interest income from loan contracts in respect of vehicles and income from plant given on lease, are accounted for by using the Internal Rate of Return method.
Consequently, a constant rate of return on the net outstanding amount is accrued over the period of contract.
The Company and its subsidiary provides an  allowance for finance receivables that are in arrears for more than 11 months, to the extent of an amount equivalent to the outstanding principal and amounts due  but unpaid considering probable inherent loss including estimated realisation based on past performance trends.
In respect of loan contracts that are in arrears for  more than 6 months but not more than 11 months, allowance is provided to the extent of 10% of the outstanding and amount due but unpaid.
(i) Sale of finance receivables   One of the subsidiary sells finance receivables to Special Purpose Entities (“SPE”) in securitisation transactions.
Recourse is in the form of the subsidiary’s investment  in subordinated securities issued by these special purpose entities, cash collateral and bank guarantees.
The loans are derecognised in the balance sheet when they are sold  and consideration has been received by the subsidiary.
Sales and transfers that do not meet the criteria for surrender of control are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Gains or losses from the sale of loans are recognised in the period the sale occurs based on the relative fair value of the portion sold and the portion allocated to  NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Independent Auditors’ Report Balance Sheet (176-206) Statement of Profit and Loss Cash Flow Statement Notes to Accounts Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 69th Annual Report 2013-14 180 Financial Statements (Consolidated) retained interests, except for subsidiaries which are governed by prudential norms for income recognition issued by the Reserve Bank of India  for Non Banking  Financial Companies (NBFC), where gains or losses on sale are accounted for as per these norms.
The estimated liability for servicing expenses in respect of assigned receivables is made based on the ratio between the cost incurred for servicing current receivables  and the collection made during the year.
(j) Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of raw materials and consumables are ascertained on a moving weighted average / monthly  moving weighted average basis, except for Jaguar and Land Rover which is on FIFO basis.
Cost, including variable and fixed overheads, are allocated to work-in- progress and finished goods determined on full absorption cost basis.
Net realisable value is estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated  cost of completion and selling expenses.
(k) Employee benefits  (i) Pension plans    One of the major subsidiary group, Jaguar Land Rover, operates several defined benefit pension plans, which are contracted out of the second state pension  scheme.
The assets of the plan are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans provide for monthly pension after retirement as per salary drawn  and service period as set out in rules of each fund.
Contributions to the plans by the subsidiary group take into consideration the results of actuarial valuations.
The plans with a surplus position at the year end  have been limited to the maximum economic benefit available from unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future contributions.
Where the subsidiary group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting value of the liabilities, an onerous  obligation is recognised.
During the year ended and as at March 31, 2014, R1,343.67 crores (debit) (net of tax) and R7,568.38 crores (debit) (net of tax) respectively have been accounted,  to “Reserves and Surplus” , representing changes in actuarial valuation of pension plans of a subsidiary company in the UK, in accordance with IFRS principles  and as permitted by AS 21 in the consolidated financial statements.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when asset is realised or the liability is settled, based  on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The tax expense is not comparable with the profit before tax, since it is consolidated on a line-by-line addition for each subsidiary company and no tax effect is  recorded in respect of consolidation adjustments.
This accounting treatment is as per accounting standard AS-21.
