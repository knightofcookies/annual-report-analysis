FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY 52 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements DIVIDEND  Considering the continued weak operating environment in the  standalone business and in view of the losses for the year, no dividend  is permitted to be paid to the Members for Fiscal 2015, as per the  Companies (Declaration and Payment of Dividend) Rules, 2014.
TRANSFER TO RESERVES The loss for the Fiscal Year is `4,738.95 crores.
After the appropriation,  the balance of `3,667.96 crores defi  cit is debited to the Profi  t and  Loss account.
OPERATING RESULTS AND PROFITS The Global growth remained moderate in Fiscal 2015 with uneven  prospects across the major economies.
The outlook for advanced  economies is improving while growth in emerging market and  developing economies is projected to be lower, primarily refl  ecting  weaker prospects for some large emerging market economies  and oil & raw material exporting economies.
The US economy  has been creating jobs resulting in decline in unemployment  rate and its housing market as well as stock indicator have moved  up demonstrating the continued recovery in the US.
Euro zone  was in recession for much of 2014, but showed signs of pickup  in the fourth quarter and in early 2015.
Eurozone is expected to  benefi  t from QE supported by lower oil prices, lower interest rates  and weaker Euro.
UK grew by 2.6% in 2014, backed by consumer  spending on account of lower infl  ation and higher wage growth.
In China the growth rate declined, refl  ecting a slowdown in the  broader economic parameters including in the real estate sector.
But government continued to support the economy with several  measures including the easing of monetary policy.
India’s economic  growth rate in Fiscal 2015 came at 7.3% (Previous Year 6.9%.
(4.7%  as per earlier methodology).
India’s economy was in the midst of  a recovery with lower fi  scal and current account defi  cit, slowing  infl  ation, lowering interest rate and weak commodity prices  coupled with steep decline in oil price over the previous year.
All  these led to revival and growth in some sector of the economy.
As  a result, the domestic auto industry witnessed growth during the  fi  scal year 2015, after witnessing de-growth in the previous fi  scal  year.
Expectation of higher capital formation, revival in the areas  of mining, and quarrying as well as manufacturing initiated the  replacement of old vehicles and thus supported the growth for the  domestic auto industry.
The Tata Motors Group  recorded a 12.6% growth in gross turnover  to `266,345 crores in Fiscal 2015 from `236,626 crores in the previous  year.
This is the highest turnover recorded by the Group.
The  consolidated revenue (net of excise) for Fiscal 2015 of `262,796 crores  grew by 12.9% over last year on the back of strong growth in wholesale  volumes across products and richer product mix markets at Jaguar  Land Rover and strong M&HCV sales in India (during second half of the  year).
The consolidated EBITDA margins for Fiscal 2015 stood at 16.0%.
Consequently, Profi  t Before Tax and Profi  t After Tax were `21,703 crores  and `13,986 crores respectively.
Tata Motors Limited  recorded a gross turnover of `39,524 crores,  4.7% higher from `37,758 crores in the previous year.
Improved  freight availability and improved profi  tability of truck operators, fl  eet  replacement demand mainly in the high tonnage segment, supported  the Company sales growth.
However, the need to increase marketing  expenses on account of severe competitive intensity and depressed  market scenario has impacted EBITDA margins decreasing it from  negative 1.4% to negative 2.2% for Fiscal 2015.
Loss Before Tax and  After Tax for the Fiscal 2015 were lower at `3,975 crores and `4,739  crores respectively, as compared to Loss Before Tax of `1,026 crores  and Profi  t After Tax of `335 crores, respectively for the corresponding  period last year.
The Company is focused on growth and achieving profi  tability through  a superior new product pipeline along with a renewed commitment  to enhance quality and customer service and reduce costs.
During the  year, the Company had launched Zest, Bolt, and Ultra Truck which has  received an encouraging response from the customers.
As a part of  the Horizonext strategy, the Company is committed to introduce new,  modifi  ed and refreshed products which will improve the Company’s  revenue.
Investment in right products and vehicle platform are being  made to ensure a competitive pipeline for the future.

A break-up of median remuneration for employees  is given below: (` in lakhs) Employee Group Median White Collar - 8.16 EG 33.97 - TM  9.33 - SUP  5.58 - Blue Collar - 4.87 Total employees - 5.29 b) The percentage increase in the median remuneration of  employees in the fi  nancial year is given below:  (` in lakhs) Employee Group %increase in the median  remuneration for Fiscal 2015  White Collar - 10.87 EG 6.01 - TM 9.70 - SUP 4.80 - Blue Collar - 7.55 c) The number of permanent employees on the rolls of Company  as on March 31, 2015 : 27,997 2.
The explanation on the relationship between average  increase in remuneration and Company performance:   The Gross revenues of the Company during the Fiscal Year of  `39,524.34 crores were higher by 4.7% over the previous year.
However, the need to increase the marketing expenses on  account of sever competitive intensity and depressed market  scenario has impacted the EBITDA margins decreasing it from  1.4% to negative 2.2% and the Loss After Tax of `4,738.95 crores  was incurred for the Fiscal Year 2015.
The total employee cost  for the Fiscal Year 2015 was ` 3,091.46 crores against `2,877.69  crores for the Fiscal Year 2014, indicating an overall increase of  7.43%.
The average increase in the remuneration during Fiscal  2015 is as mentioned in point no.1 above as compared to the  previous Fiscal Year.
Average increase in the remuneration is guided by factors like  economic growth, infl  ation, mandatory increases, external  competitiveness and talent retention.
Whilst the Company  endeavors on cost eff  ective initiatives including employees  cost being one of the key areas of cost monitoring and  control, the results of any structural initiatives needs to be  measured over a long term horizon and cannot be strictly  compared with annual performance indicators.
On an average an employee receives an annual increase of  10.63%.
The wage increments for blue collar are governed by  plant-wise settlements which are held every 3-5 years.
The  wage revision for white collar employees is done annually.
In order to ensure that remuneration refl  ects Company  performance, the performance pay & annual increment  are also linked to organization performance, apart from an  individual’s performance.
The individual increments for white  collar employees varied from 0% to 20% on Total Fixed Pay &  the performance pay varied from 0% to 30% of the Total Fixed  Pay.
The Increase in remuneration is in line with the market  trends.
The Company remains committed to pursuing the long  term interest of all stakeholders, which includes recruiting  and retaining an industry proven management team  and ensuring that the Company’s leadership and talent  base is appropriately remunerated, notwithstanding cyclical  phases.
This is especially imperative when the Company has  ongoing signifi  cant turnaround and growth strategies under  execution.

92 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements ECONOMY OVERVIEW INDIA In the wake of a new Central Government, higher spending on  g ross capital formation, slowing infl  ation, lowering interest rates  and crude oil price compared to the previous fi  scal year, some  sectors of the economy have started showing signs of revival and  higher growth.
Both fi  scal and current account defi  cits remained  relatively stable, which contributed to growth.
As adjusted for a methodological revision in India’s GDP calculation,  GDP for Fiscal 2014 increased by 6.9% (compared to a previous  estimate of 4.7%) and GDP for Fiscal 2015 increased by 7.3%  (compared to a previous estimate of 5.5%).
Growth in Agriculture  and Industry decreased in Fiscal 2015 by 1.1% as compared to 3.7%  while services sector growth increased by 8.4% as compared to  11.1% in the same period.
IIP growth has shown signs of revival  based on increases in IIP between November 2014 to March 2015.
IIP increased by 2.8% in Fiscal 2015 as compared to a decrease of  0.1% in Fiscal 2014.
Signifi  cant factors infl  uencing IIP growth in Fiscal  2015 included a 1.4% increase in the mining sector in Fiscal 2015  compared to a decrease of 0.6% in Fiscal 2014, and an increase in  the manufacturing sector of 2.3%, compared to a decrease of 0.8%  in Fiscal 2014.
However, consumer durables continue to remain  negative at 12.5% (negative 12.2% in Fiscal 2014) (Source: Ministry  of Statistics and Programme implementation).
The domestic auto industry witnessed growth during Fiscal 2015,  compared to a contraction in the previous year.
Lower interest rates  and infl  ation in Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014 contributed to  an improvement in consumer sentiment, which in turn contributed  to an increase in automobile purchases.
Expectations of higher  capital expenditures and revivals in the mining, quarrying and  manufacturing sectors contributed to replacements of old vehicles  in commercial fl  eets, which in turn contributed to growth in the  domestic auto industry.
WORLD Global growth remains moderate with uneven prospects across the  major economies .
The outlook for advanced economies is improving,  while growth in emerging market and developing economies is  projected to be lower, primarily refl  ecting weaker prospects for certain  large emerging market economies alongside oil and raw material  exporting economies.
Oil prices have declined during the year due  to weaker than expected global activity and a weaker demand for  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  oil against the available supply.
Exchange rate movements in recent  months have been sizable, refl  ecting changes in expectations  about growth and monetary policy across major economies.
Long- term government bond yields have declined in major advanced  economies, refl  ecting in part lower infl  ation expectations, the sharp  decline in oil prices and weak domestic demand.
The US economy growth was stronger than expected and has been  creating jobs, resulting in a decline in the unemployment rate.
Furthermore, lower oil prices, increases in incomes and improved  consumer confi  dence have resulted in growth in the US.
The Eurozone was in a recession for much of 2014, but showed  signs of economic improvement in the fourth quarter and in early  2015, with consumption supported by lower oil prices and higher  net exports.
Growth in the Eurozone is gradually picking up, driven  by lower energy prices, a weaker Euro and a loose monetary policy  by the European Central Bank.
Germany and France continue to be  growth engines of the region.
However, Italy, Spain, Portugal and  Greece experienced high unemployment and diminishing growth  in Fiscal 2015.
In 2014, the GDP in the UK grew by 2.6%.
UK labour  market conditions improved as employment increased.
Rising  consumer and business confi  dence contributed to stronger retail  sales and investment spending.
Economic expectations and results for emerging markets diff  ered  across regions, and were impacted by various economic factors.
Growth in Latin America in the second half of 2014 was modest,  refl  ecting weak economic activity in Brazil, lower than expected  growth in Mexico, and weakening momentum in other economies  in the region.
In China the growth rate declined, refl  ecting an overall  economic slowdown, including in the real estate sector.
The Chinese  government continues to support the economy, including through  the easing of monetary policy.
Economic performance in Russia was  impacted by the increase in geopolitical tensions, lower crude oil  prices and economic sanctions.
In Japan, growth in 2014 was close  to zero, refl  ecting weak consumption and decreasing investment  by households.
In South Africa, domestic growth remains weak due  to weak external demand, which has been off set by lower oil prices  and infl  ation.
Risk Factors R isk associated with the Company’s Business and the  Automotive Industry.
Deterioration in global economic conditions could have a  93 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) material adverse impact on the Company’s sales and results of  operations.
The automotive industry and the demand for automobiles are  infl  uenced by general economic conditions, including, among other  things, rates of economic growth, credit availability, disposable  income of consumers, interest rates, environmental and tax policies,  safety regulations, freight rates and fuel and commodity prices.
Negative trends in any of these factors impacting the regions where  the Company operates could materially and adversely aff  ect the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
The Indian automotive industry is materially aff  ected by the  general economic conditions in India and around the world.
Muted  industrial growth in India in recent years along with continuing  higher infl  ation and interest rates continue to pose risks to overall  growth in this market.
The automotive industry in general is  cyclical and economic slowdowns in the recent past have aff ected  the manufacturing sector in India, including the automotive and  related industries.
A continuation of negative economic trends or  further deterioration in key economic metrics such as the growth  rate, interest rates and infl  ation as well as reduced availability of  fi  nancing for vehicles at competitive rates could materially and  adversely aff  ect the Company’s automotive sales in India and results  of operations.
In addition, the Indian automotive market and the Indian economy  are infl  uenced by economic and market conditions in other  countries.
Although economic conditions are diff  erent in each  country, investors’ reactions to economic developments in one  country can have adverse eff  ects on the securities of companies  and the economy as a whole in other countries, including India.
A loss of investor confi  dence in the fi  nancial systems of other  emerging markets may cause volatility in Indian fi  nancial markets  and, indirectly, in the Indian economy in general.
Any worldwide  fi  nancial instability could also have a negative impact on the Indian  economy, including the movement of exchange rates and interest  rates in India.
A slower than expected global economic recovery or  a signifi  cant fi  nancial disruption could have a material adverse eff ect  on the Company’s cost of funding, portfolio of fi  nancing loans,  business, prospects, results of operations, fi  nancial condition and  the trading price of the Company’s shares or American Depositary  Shares, or ADSs.
The Company’s Jaguar Land Rover business has signifi  cant  operations in the United Kingdom, North America, continental  Europe and China as well as sales operations in many major  countries across the globe.
While the automotive market in the  United States, United Kingdom and Europe experienced healthy  growth in Fiscal 2015, headwinds remain.
Low economic growth  in the Eurozone prompted the European Central Bank to engage  in quantitative easing beginning in January 2015, and uncertainty  over debt negotiations with Greece remains.
Economic sanctions  and declining energy prices continue to impact Russia.
Recessionary  concerns are mounting in Brazil whereas China’s economy is  showing signs of slowing.
Jaguar Land Rover’s ambitions for growth  in emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, may  not materalise as expected, which could have a signifi  cant adverse  impact on the Company fi  nancial performance.
If automotive  demand softens because of lower or negative economic growth  in key markets (notably China) or other factors, the Company’s  operations and fi  nancial condition could be materially and adversely  aff ected.
Restrictive covenants in fi  nancing agreements may limit the  Company operations and fi  nancial fl exibility and materially  and adversely impact the Company’s fi  nancial condition,  results of operations and prospects.
Some of the Company’s fi  nancing agreements and debt  ar rangements set limits on or require it to obtain lender consent  before, among other things, pledging assets as security.
In addition,  certain fi  nancial covenants may limit the Company’s ability to  borrow additional funds or to incur additional liens.
In the past, the  Company has been able to obtain required lender consent for such  activities.
However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to  obtain such consents in the future.
If the Company’s liquidity needs,  or growth plans, require such consents and such consents are not  obtained, it may be forced to forego or alter plans, which could  materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s fi  nancial condition  and results of operations.
If the Company breaches its fi  nancing agreements, the outstanding  amounts due thereunder could become due and payable  immediately or result in increased costs.
A default under one of  these agreements may also result in cross-defaults under other  fi  nancing agreements and result in the outstanding amounts under  such other fi  nancing agreements becoming due and payable  immediately.
The Company’s lenders and guarantors could impose  additional operating and fi  nancial restrictions on the Company,  or otherwise seek to modify the terms of its existing fi  nancial  agreements.
This could have a material adverse eff  ect on the  Company’s fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
94 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements In Fiscal 2014, the Company had been in breach of fi  nancial  covenants relating to the ratio of total outstanding liabilities  to tangible net worth, and to the debt service coverage ratio  in various fi  nancing agreements.
The Company requested and  obtained waivers of its obligations from the lenders and guarantors  to pay additional costs as a consequence of such breaches.
These  breaches have not resulted in an event of default in the Company’s  fi  nancing agreements or the payment of penalties.
In Fiscal 2015, the Company has prepaid the above borrowings  and hence there has not been any breach of fi  nancial covenants.
However, there can be no assurances that the Company will  succeed in obtaining consents or waivers in the future from its  lenders or guarantors in the future, and future non-compliance  with the fi  nancial covenants contained in the Company’s fi  nancial  agreements may lead to increased cost for future fi  nancings.
Exchange rate and interest rate fl  uctuations could materially  and adversely aff  ect the Company’s fi  nancial condition and  results of operations.
The Company’s operations are subject to risks arising from  fl  uctuations in exchange rates with reference to countries in which  the Company operates.
The Company imports capital equipment,  raw materials and components from, manufactures vehicles in, and  sells vehicles in various countries, and therefore the Company’s  revenues and costs have signifi  cant exposure to the relative  movements of the GBP , the US dollar, the Euro, the Russian Ruble,  the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen and the Indian rupee.
Moreover, the Company has outstanding foreign currency- denominated debt and is sensitive to fl  uctuations in foreign  currency exchange rates.
The Company has experienced and  expects to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and  gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect  of the Company’s borrowings and foreign currency assets and  liabilities due to currency fl  uctuations.
The Company also has interest-bearing assets (including cash  balances) and interest-bearing liabilities, which bear interest at  variable rates.
The Company is therefore exposed to changes in  interest rates in the various markets in which it borrows.
Although  the Company manages its interest and foreign exchange exposure  through the use of fi  nancial hedging instruments such as forward  contracts, swap agreements and option contracts, higher interest  rates and foreign exchange volatility could signifi  cantly increase the  Company’s cost of borrowing, which could have a material adverse  eff ect on its fi  nancial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Intensifying competition could materially and adversely  aff  ect the Company’s sales, fi nancial conditions and results of  operations.
The global automotive industry is highly competitive and  competition is lik ely to further intensify in light of continuing  globalisation and consolidation in the worldwide automotive  industry.
Competition is especially likely to increase in the premium  automotive categories as each market participant intensifi  es its  eff orts to retain its position in established markets while also  expanding in emerging markets, such as China, India, Russia, Brazil  and parts of Asia.
Factors aff  ecting competition include product  quality and features, innovation and the timing of the introduction of  new products, cost control, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy,  environmental impact (and perception thereof ), customer service  and fi  nancing terms.
There can be no assurance that the Company  will be able to compete successfully in the global automotive  industry in the future.
The Company also faces strong competition in the Indian market  from domestic as well as foreign automobile manufacturers.
Improving infrastructure and robust growth prospects compared  to other mature markets have attracted a number of international  companies to India either through joint ventures with local partners  or through independently owned operations in India.
International  competitors bring with them decades of international experience,  global scale, advanced technology and signifi  cant fi  nancial resources.
Consequently, domestic competition is likely to further intensify in  the future.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able  to implement future strategies in a way that will mitigate the eff ects  of increased competition in the Indian automotive industry.
Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive  and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery,  research and development, product design, engineering,  technology and marketing in order to meet both customer  preferences and regulatory requirements.
If competitors consolidate  or enter into other strategic agreements, they may be able to  take better advantage of economies of scale or enhance their  competitiveness in other ways.
Competitors may also be able to  benefi  t from the cost savings off ered by consolidation or alliances,  which could adversely aff ect the Company’s competitiveness with  respect to those competitors, which could also materially reduce  the Company’s sales as well as materially and adversely aff ect its  business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
95 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) The Company’s future success depends on its ability to  satisfy changing customer demands by off  ering innovative  products in a timely manner and maintaining such products’  competitiveness and quality.
The Company’s competitors may gain signifi  cant advantages if they  ar e able to off  er products satisfying customer needs earlier than the  Company is able to, which could adversely impact, the Company’s  sales and profi  tability.
Unanticipated delays or cost overruns in  implementing new product launches, expansion plans or capacity  enhancements could also adversely impact the Company’s results  of operations.
Customer preferences, especially in many of the developed  markets, seem to be moving in favour of more fuel-effi   cient and  environmentally-friendly vehicles.
Increased government regulation,  rising fuel prices, and evolving environmental preferences of  consumers has brought signifi  cant pressure on the automotive  industry to reduce CO 2 emissions.
The Company’s operations may  be signifi  cantly impacted if it experiences delays in developing  fuel-effi  cient products that refl  ect changing customer preferences.
In addition, deterioration in the quality of vehicles could force the  Company to incur substantial cost and damage to its reputation.
There can be no assurance that the market acceptance of the  Company’s future products will meet sales expectations, in which  case the Company may be unable to realise the intended economic  benefi  ts of the investments, and its revenues and profi  tability may  decrease materially.
Private and commercial users of transportation increasingly use  modes of transportation other than the automobile.
The reasons for  this include the rising costs of automotive transport, increasing traffi  c  density in major cities and environmental awareness.
Furthermore,  the increased use of car-sharing concepts and other innovative  mobility initiatives facilitates access to other methods of transport,  thereby reducing dependency on the private automobile.
A shift in  consumer preferences away from private automobiles would have a  material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s general business activity  and on its sales, fi  nancial position and results of operations as well  as prospects.
To stimulate demand, competitors in the automotive industry have  off ered customers and dealers price reductions on vehicles and  services, which has led to increased price pressures and sharpened  competition within the industry.
As a provider of numerous high- volume models, the Company’s profi  tability and cash fl  ows are  signifi  cantly aff ected by the risk of rising competitive and price  pressures.
Special sales incentives and increased price pressures  in the new car business also infl  uence price levels in the used car  market, with a negative eff ect on vehicle resale values.
This may  have a negative impact on the profi  tability of the used car business  in the Company’s dealer organisation.
The Company is subject to risks associated with product  liabilit y warranties and recalls.
Should it supply defective products, parts, or related after-sales  ser vices, the Company is subject to risks and costs associated with  product liability, including negative publicity, which may have  a material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial  conditions and results of operations.
These events could also require  the Company to spend considerable resources in correcting these  problems and could signifi  cantly reduce demand for the Company’s  products.
In Fiscal 2015, the Company implemented product recalls  for Jaguar Land Rover vehicles sold in North America and China.
The  Company may also be subject to class actions or other large-scale  product liability or other lawsuits in various jurisdictions where it  has a presence.
The Company is subject to risks associated with the automobile  fi nancing  business.
The Company is subject to risks associated with its automobile  fi  nancing business in India.
In Fiscal 2015, the market share of the  Company’s automobile fi  nancing business, which supports sales of the  Company vehicles, declined to 24.0% from 30.0% in Fiscal 2014.
Any  default by the Company’s customers or inability to repay installments  as due could materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s business,  fi  nancial condition, results of operations and cash fl  ows.
The sale of the Company’s commercial and passenger vehicles is  heavily dependent on funding availability for the customers.
Rising  delinquencies and early defaults have contributed to a reduction  in automobile fi  nancing, which, in turn, has had an adverse eff  ect  on funding availability for potential customers.
This reduction in  available fi  nancing may continue in the future and have a material  adverse eff  ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and  results of operations.
Jaguar Land Rover has consumer fi  nancing arrangements in place  with local providers in a number of key markets.
Any reduction in  the supply of available consumer fi  nancing for purchase of new  vehicles could create additional pressures to increase marketing  incentives in order to maintain demand for the Company’s  vehicles.
This could materially reduce the Company’s sales and net  96 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements income.
Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rover also off  ers residual value  guarantees on the leases of certain vehicles in some markets.
Any signifi  cant declines in used car valuations could materially  and adversely aff ect the Company’s sales, fi  nancial condition and  results of operations.
Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit rating  downgrade, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory changes  or otherwise, the Company may need to reduce the amount of  fi  nancing receivables that it originates, which could severely disrupt  the Company’s ability to support the sale of its vehicles.
Underperformance of the Company’s distribution channels  and supply chains may hav e a material adverse eff  ect on the  Company’s sales, fi nancial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s products are sold and serviced through a network  of author ised dealers and service centres across the domestic  market and via a network of distributors and local dealers in  international markets.
The Company monitors the performance  of its dealers and distributors and provides them with support  to enable them to perform to the Company’s expectations.
There can be no assurance, however, that these expectations  will be met.
Any underperformance by the Company dealers  or distributors could adversely aff ect the Company’s sales and  results of operations.
The Company relies on third parties to supply raw materials, parts  and components used in the manufacture of products.
For some  of these parts and components, the Company is dependent on a  single source.
The Company’s ability to procure supplies in a cost  eff ective and timely manner is subject to various factors, some  of which are not within its control.
While the Company manages  its supply chain as part of the vendor management process, any  signifi  cant problems with supply chain in the future could disrupt  its business and materially aff ect the results of operations as well  as its sales and net income.
Natural disasters and man-made accidents, adverse economic  conditions, a decline in automobile demand, a lack of access to  suffi  cient fi  nancing arrangements, among others things, could have  a negative fi  nancial impact on the Company’s suppliers, thereby  impairing timely availability of components to the Company or  causing increases in the costs of components.
Similarly, impairments  to the fi  nancial condition of the Company’s distributors for any reason  may adversely impact the Company’s performance.
In addition, if  one or more of the other global automotive manufacturers were  to become insolvent, this would have an adverse eff ect on the  Company’s supply chains and may have a material adverse eff  ect  on the Company’s results of operations.
In respect of the Jaguar Land Rover operations, as part of a  separation agreement from Ford Motor Company, the Company has  entered into long-term supply agreements for critical components  with Ford Motor Company and certain other third parties for critical  components which requires Jaguar Land Rover to purchase fi  xed  quantities of parts through take-or-pay contracts.
Any disruption  of such services or invocation of take-or-pay contracts could have  a material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
Increases in input prices may have a material adverse eff ec t on  the Company results of operations.
In Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the consumption of raw materials,  components and agg regates and purchase of products for sale  (Consolidated) approximately 60.9% and 61.7%, respectively,  of the Company’s total revenues.
Prices of commodity items  used in manufacturing automobiles, including steel, aluminium,  copper, zinc, rubber, platinum, palladium and rhodium, have  become increasingly volatile in recent years.
Further price  movements would closely depend on the evolving economic  scenarios across the globe.
While the Company continues  to pursue cost-reduction initiatives, an increase in the price  of input materials could severely impact its profi  tability, to  the extent such increase cannot be absorbed by the market  through price increases and/or could have a negative impact  on demand.
In addition, an increased price and supply risk could arise  from the need for rare and frequently sought-after raw materials  for which demand is high, such as rare earths, which are  predominantly found in China.
Rare earth metal prices and supply  remain uncertain.
In the past, China has limited the export of  rare earths from time to time.
Due to intense price competition  and the Company’s high level of fi  xed costs, the Company may  not be able to adequately address changes in commodity prices  even if they are foreseeable.
Increases in fuel costs also pose a  signifi  cant challenge, especially in the commercial and premium  vehicle categories where increased fuel prices have an impact  on demand.
If the Company is unable to fi  nd substitutes for  supplies of raw materials, pass price increases on to customers  or safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials, the Company’s  vehicle production, business and results from operations could be  aff ected.
97 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) Deterioration in the performance of any of the subsidiaries,  joint ventures and affi   liates may adversely the Company’s  results of operations.
The Company has made and may continue to make capital  commitments t o its subsidiaries, joint ventures and affi  liates.
If the  business or operations of any of these subsidiaries, joint ventures  and affi  liates deteriorates, the value of the Company’s investments  may decline substantially.
The Company is also subject to risks  associated with joint ventures and affi   liates wherein the Company  retains only partial or joint control.
The Company’s partners may be  unable or unwilling to fulfi  ll their obligations, or the strategies of  the Company’s joint ventures or affi   liates may not be implemented  successfully, any of which may materially reduce the value of the  Company investments, which may in turn have a material adverse  eff ect on the Company’s reputation, business, fi  nancial position or  results of operations.
The signifi cant reliance of Jaguar Land Rover on key markets  increases the risk of the negative impact of reduced customer  demand in those countries.
Jaguar Land Rover, which contributes a large portion of the  C ompany’s consolidated revenues, generates a signifi  cant portion  of its sales in China, the United Kingdom, North American and  continental European markets.
Furthermore, in the fourth quarter  of Fiscal 2015, retail sales of Jaguar Land Rover in China decreased  by 20% to 23,526 units from 29,567 units compared to the same  period in Fiscal 2014.
A decline in demand for Jaguar Land Rover  vehicles in these major markets, including China, or inability to  maintain its pricing strategy in these markets, including China,  may signifi  cantly impair the Company’s business, fi  nancial position  and results of operations.
The Company is subject to risks associated with growing the  business throu gh mergers and acquisitions.
The Company believes that acquisitions provide it opportunities  t o grow signifi  cantly in the global automobile markets by off  ering  premium brands and products.
Acquisitions have provided it  with access to technology and additional capabilities while  also off ering potential synergies.
However, the scale, scope and  nature of the integration required in connection with acquisitions  presents signifi  cant challenges, and the Company may be unable  to integrate relevant subsidiaries, divisions and facilities eff ectively  within the expected schedule.
An acquisition may not meet the  Company’s expectations and the realisation of the anticipated  benefi  ts may be blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of  numerous factors, some of which are outside the Company’s  control.
For example, the Company acquired the Jaguar Land Rover  business from Ford Motor Company in June 2008, and Jaguar Land  Rover has become a signifi  cant part of the Company’s business and  accounted for approximately 86% of its total revenues for Fiscal  2015.
As a result of the acquisition, the Company is responsible  for, among other things, the obligations and liabilities associated  with the legacy business of Jaguar Land Rover.
There can be no  assurances that any legacy issues at Jaguar Land Rover or any  other acquisition the Company has undertaken in the past or will  undertake in the future would not have a material adverse eff ect  on its business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations, as  well as its reputation and prospects.
The Company will continue to evaluate growth opportunities  through suitable mergers and acquisitions in the future.
Growth  through mergers and acquisitions involves business risks,  including unforeseen contingent risks or latent business liabilities  that may only become apparent after the merger or acquisition  is completed.
The key success factors are seamless integration,  eff ective management of the merged and/or acquired entity,  retention of key personnel, cash fl  ow generation from synergies  in engineering and sourcing, joint sales and marketing eff  orts,  and management of a larger business.
If any of these factors fails  to materialise or if the Company is unable to manage any of the  associated risks successfully, the Company’s business, fi  nancial  condition and results of operations could be materially and  adversely aff ected.
The automobile business is seasonal in nature and substantial  decrease in sales during c ertain quarters could have a material  adverse impact on the Company’s fi  nancial performance.
The sales, volumes and prices for the Company vehicles are  infl  uenced by the cyclicality and seasonality of demand for these  products.
The automotive industry has been cyclical in the past  and the Company expects this cyclicality to continue.
In the Indian market, demand for the Company’s vehicles generally  peaks between January and March, although there is a decrease in  demand in February just before release of the Indian fi  scal budget.
Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up again in  the festival season from September onwards, with a decline in  December due to year end.
98 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements The Jaguar Land Rover business is impacted by the semi-annual  registration of vehicles in the United Kingdom where the vehicle  registration number changes every March and September, which,  in turn, has an impact on the resale value of vehicles.
Most  other markets, such as the United States, are infl  uenced by the  introduction of new-model-year products which typically occurs  in the autumn of each year, and there is some seasonality around  the purchase of vehicles in northern states where the purchase  of Jaguar vehicles is concentrated in the spring and summer  months, and the purchase of 4x4 vehicles is concentrated in the  autumn/winter months.
Markets in China tend to experience  higher demand for vehicles around the Chinese New Year.
Demand in western European automotive markets tends to be  reduced during the summer and winter holidays.
Furthermore, the  Company’s cash fl  ows are impacted by the temporary shutdown  of three of its manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom  during the summer and winter holidays.
The resulting sales and  cash fl  ow profi  le infl  uences operating results on a quarter to  quarter basis.
The Company’s business and operations could be materially  and adv ersely aff ected by labour unrest.
All of the Company’s permanent employees in India, other than  offi   cers and managers, and most of the permanent employees  in South Korea and the United Kingdom, including certain  offi  cers and managers, in relation to the Company automotive  business, are members of labour unions and are covered by  wage agreements, where applicable, with those labour unions.
In general, the Company considers labour relations with all of  its employees to be good.
However, in the future, the Company  may be subject to labour unrest, which may delay or disrupt the  operations in the aff  ected regions, including the acquisition of  raw materials and parts, the manufacture, sales and distribution of  products and the provision of services.
If work stoppages or lock- outs at the Company facilities or at the facilities of the Company  major vendors occur or continue for a long period of time, the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations  could be materially and adversely aff  ected.
The Company’s business could be negatively aff  ected by the  actions of activist shareholders.
Certain of the Company’s shareholders may from time to time  advance shar eholder proposals or otherwise attempt to eff  ect  changes or acquire control over the Company’s business.
Campaigns  by shareholders to eff ect changes at publicly listed companies are  sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder  value by advocating corporate actions such as fi  nancial restructuring,  increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even  sales of assets or the entire company, or by voting against proposals  put forward by the board of directors and management of the  company.
If faced with actions by activist shareholders, the Company  may not be able to respond eff  ectively to such actions, which could  be disruptive to the Company’s business.
The Company may have to comply with more stringent foreign  in vestment norms in the event of an increase in shareholding  of non-residents or if the Company is considered as engaged in  a sector in which foreign investment is restricted.
Indian companies, which are owned or controlled by non- r esident persons, are subject to investment restrictions specifi  ed  in the Consolidated FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Policy, or the  Consolidated FDI Policy.
Under the Consolidated FDI Policy, an  Indian company is considered to be “owned” by a non-resident  persons if more than 50% of its equity interest is benefi  cially owned  by non-resident persons.
The non-resident equity shareholding in  the Company may, in the near future, exceed 50%, thereby resulting  in the Company being considered as being “owned” by non-resident  entities under the Consolidated FDI Policy.
In such an event, any  investment by the Company in existing subsidiaries, associates or  joint ventures and new subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures will  be considered as indirect foreign investment and shall be subject  to various requirements specifi  ed under the Consolidated FDI  Policy, including sectoral limits, approval requirements and pricing  guidelines, as may be applicable.
Furthermore, as part of its automotive business, the Company  supplies and has in the past supplied vehicles to Indian military and  paramilitary forces and, in the course of such activities has obtained  an industrial license from the Department of Industrial Policy.
The Consolidated FDI policy applies diff  erent foreign investment  restrictions to companies based upon the sector in which they  operate.
While the Company believes it is an automobile company  by virtue of the signifi  cance of its automobile operations, in the  event that foreign investment regulations applicable to the defense  sector (including under the Consolidated FDI Policy) are made  applicable to the Company, the Company may face more stringent  foreign investment restrictions and other compliance requirements  compared to those applicable to it presently, which in turn could  materially aff  ect the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and  results of operations.
99 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) The Company’s business and prospects could suff  er if the  Company loses one or more key personnel or if it is unable to  attract and retain its employees.
The Company’s business and future growth depend largely on  the sk ills of its workforce, including executives and offi   cers, and  automotive designers and engineers.
The loss of the services of  one or more of the Company’s personnel could impair its ability  to implement its business strategy.
In view of intense competition,  any inability to continue to attract, retain or motivate the workforce  could materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s business,  fi  nancial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Future pension obligations may prove more costly than  currently anticipated and the mark et value of assets in the  Company’s pension plans could decline.
The Company provides post-retirement and pension benefi  ts to  its employ ees, including defi  ned benefi  t plans.
The Company’s  pension liabilities are generally funded.
However, lower returns on  pension fund assets, change in market conditions, interest rates  or infl  ation rates, and adverse changes in other critical actuarial  assumptions may impact the Company’s pension liabilities or assets  and consequently increase funding requirements, which could  materially decrease the Company’s net income and cash fl  ows.
Any inability to manage the Company’s growing international  business may materially and adv ersely aff ect its fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
The Company’s growth strategy relies on the expansion of the  C ompany’s operations by introducing certain automotive products  in markets outside India, including Europe, China, Russia, Brazil, the  United States, Africa and other parts of Asia.
The costs associated  with entering and establishing the Company in new markets, and  expanding such operations, may be higher than expected, and  the Company may face signifi  cant competition in those regions.
In addition, the Company’s international business is subject to  many actual and potential risks and challenges, including language  barriers, cultural diff  erences and other diffi  culties in staffi   ng and  managing overseas operations, inherent diffi   culties and delays in  contract enforcement and collection of receivables under the legal  systems of some foreign countries, the risk of non-tariff  barriers,  other restrictions on foreign trade or investment sanctions, and  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, rules  and regulations.
As part of its global activities, the Company may  engage with third-party dealers and distributors which it does  not control but which nevertheless take actions that could have a  material adverse impact on the Company reputation and business.
In addition, the Company cannot assure you that it will not be  held responsible for any activities undertaken by such dealers  and distributors.
If the Company is unable to manage the risks  related to its expansion and growth in other parts of the world, the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations  could be materially and adversely aff ected.
The Company has a limited number of manufacturing, design,  engineering and other f acilities, and any disruption in the  operations of these facilities could materially and adversely  aff ect the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results  of operations.
The Company has manufacturing facilities and design and  eng ineering centres in India, the United Kingdom, China, South  Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Brazil, and has established a  presence in Indonesia.
The Company could experience disruptions  to its manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities for a  variety of reasons, including, among others, extreme weather, fi  re,  theft, system failures, natural catastrophes, mechanical or equipment  failures and similar events.
Any such disruptions could aff ect the  Company’s ability to design, manufacture and sell its products.
If  any of these events were to occur, there can be no assurance that  the Company would be able to shift its design, engineering or  manufacturing operations to alternate sites in a timely manner or  at all.
Any such disruption could materially and adversely aff ect the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
The Company relies on licensing arrangements with Tata  S ons Limited to use the “Tata” brand.
Any improper use of  the associated trademarks by the Company’s licensor or any  other third parties could materially and adversely aff ect  the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of  operations.
The Company’s rights to its trade names and trademarks are a  crucial fac tor in marketing its products.
Establishment of the “Tata”  word mark and logo mark, in and outside India, is material to the  Company’s operations.
The Company has licensed the use of the  “Tata” brand from its Promoter, Tata Sons Limited.
If its Promoter, or  any of its subsidiaries or affi   liated entities, or any third party uses the  trade name “Tata” in ways that adversely aff  ect such trade name or  trademark, the Company’s reputation could suff  er damage, which  in turn could have a material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s  business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
100 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements The Company is exposed to operational risks, including risks in  connection with the Company’s use of information technology.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  int ernal systems and processes, from either internal or external events.
Such risks could stem from inadequacy or failures of controls within  internal procedures, violations of internal policies by employees,  disruptions or malfunctioning of information technology systems  such as computer networks and telecommunication systems, other  mechanical or equipment failures, human error, natural disasters  or malicious acts by third parties.
Any unauthorised access to or  misuse of data on the Company’s information technology systems,  human errors or technological or process failures of any kind  could severely disrupt the Company’s operations, including its  manufacturing, design and engineering processes, and could have  a material adverse eff  ect on the Company fi  nancial condition and  results of operations.
The Company may be materially and adversely aff ected by the  divulgence of confi dential information.
Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures  t o protect confi  dential information such as key contractual  provisions, future projects, and customer records, such information  may be divulged, including as a result of hacking or other threats  from cyberspace.
If this occurs, the Company could be subject to  claims by aff ected parties, negative publicity and loss of proprietary  information, all of which could have an adverse and material  impact on the Company’s business, fi  nancial conditions, results of  operations and cash fl  ows.
Any failures or weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls  c ould materially and adversely aff  ect the Company fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
Upon an evaluation of the eff  ectiveness of the design and  operation of the Company’s internal controls in the annual report  on Form 20- F fi  led with the SEC for the year ended March 31,  2014, the Company concluded that there was a material weakness  such that the Company internal controls over fi  nancial reporting  were not eff  ective as at March 31, 2014.
Although the Company  has instituted remedial measures to address the material weakness  identifi  ed and continually review and evaluate its internal control  systems to allow management to report on the suffi  ciency of the  Company’s internal controls, the Company cannot assure you that  it will not discover additional weaknesses in the Company internal  controls over fi  nancial reporting.
Any such additional weaknesses  or failure to adequately remediate any existing weakness could  materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s fi  nancial condition  or results of operations and the Company’s ability to accurately  report its fi  nancial condition and results of operations in a timely  and reliable manner.
Inability to protect or preserve intellectual property could  materially and adv ersely aff  ect the Company’s business,  fi nancial condition and results of operations.
The Company owns or otherwise has rights in respect to a number  of pat ents relating to the products the Company manufactures.
In  connection with the design and engineering of new vehicles and  the enhancement of existing models, the Company seeks to regularly  develop new intellectual property.
The Company also uses technical  designs which are the intellectual property of third parties with such  third parties’ consent.
These patents and trademarks have been of  value in the growth of the Company’s business and may continue  to be of value in the future.
Although the Company does not regard  any of the Company’s businesses as being dependent upon any  single patent or related group of patents, an inability to protect  this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some or  a large group of the Company’s intellectual property rights, would  have a materially adverse eff ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
The Company may also be  aff ected by restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights held  by third parties and it may be held legally liable for the infringement  of the intellectual property rights of others in its products.
The Company’s insurance coverage may not be adequate to  protec t the Company against all potential losses to which  the Company may be subject, and this may have a material  adverse eff ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition  and results of operations.
While the Company believes that the insurance coverage that it  maintains is r easonably adequate to cover all normal risks associated  with the operation of its business, there can be no assurance that  its insurance coverage will be suffi  cient, that any claim under  such insurance policies will be honured fully or timely, or that the  insurance premiums will not increase substantially.
Accordingly, to  the extent that the Company suff  ers loss or damage that is not  covered by insurance or which exceeds its insurance coverage,  or is required to pay higher insurance premiums, the Company’s  business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations may be  materially and adversely aff ected.
101 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) Impairment of intangible assets may have a material adverse  eff ect on the Company’s results of operations.
Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive  and r equires substantial investments in intangible assets like  research and development, product design and engineering  technology.
The Company reviews the value of its intangible  assets on an annual basis to assess whether the carrying amount  matches the recoverable amount for the asset concerned based  on underlying cash generating units.
The Company may have to  take an impairment loss as of the current balance sheet date or  a future balance sheet date, if the carrying amount exceeds the  recoverable amount, which could have a material adverse eff ect on  the Company fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
The Company requires certain approvals or licenses in the  ordinar y course of business, and the failure to obtain or retain  them in a timely manner, or at all, may adversely aff  ect its  operations.
The Company requires certain statutory and regulatory permits,  licenses and appr ovals to carry out its business operations and  applications for their renewal need to be made within certain  time frames.
For some of the approvals which may have expired,  the Company has either made or are in the process of making an  application for obtaining the approval or its renewal.
While the  Company has applied for renewal for a few of these approvals,  registrations and permits, the Company cannot assure you that it  will receive these approvals and registrations in a timely manner  or at all.
The Company can make no assurances that the approvals,  licenses, registrations and permits issued to the Company would  not be suspended or revoked in the event of non-compliance or  alleged non-compliance with any terms or conditions thereof, or  pursuant to any regulatory action.
Furthermore, if the Company  is unable to renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and  approvals on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all, the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and operations may be  adversely aff ected.
Political and Regulatory Risks India ’s obligations under the World Trade Organisation  Agreement could materially aff ect the Company’s business.
India’s obligations under its World Trade Organization agreement  could r educe the present level of tariff s on imports of components  and vehicles.
Reductions of import tariff  s could result in increased  competition, which, in turn, could materially and adversely aff ect the  Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with new and current laws, rules, regulations  and go vernment policies regarding increased fuel economy,  reduced greenhouse gas and other emissions, vehicle  safety, taxes and pricing policies in the automotive industry  signifi cantly increase the Company’s costs and materially  decrease its net income.
As an automobile company, the Company is subject to extensive  gov ernmental regulations regarding vehicle emissions levels, noise  and safety, and levels of pollutants generated by its production  facilities.
These regulations are likely to become more stringent,  and the resulting higher compliance costs may signifi  cantly  impact the Company’s future results of operations.
In particular,  the United States and Europe have stringent regulations relating  to vehicle emissions.
The proposed tightening of vehicle emissions  regulations by the European Union will require signifi  cant costs  for compliance.
In addition, a number of further legislative and  regulatory measures to address greenhouse emissions, including  national laws, and the Kyoto Protocol, are in various phases of  discussion and implementation.
In order to comply with current and future safety and  environmental norms, the Company may have to incur additional  costs to (i) operate and maintain its production facilities, (ii) install  new emissions controls or reduction technologies, (iii) purchase  or otherwise obtain allowances to emit greenhouse gases, (iv)  administer and manage the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions  program, and (v) invest in research and development to upgrade  products and manufacturing facilities.
If the Company is unable to  develop commercially viable technologies or is otherwise unable to  attain compliance within the time frames set by new standards, the  Company could face signifi  cant civil penalties or be forced to restrict  product off erings drastically.
Moreover, safety and environmental  standards may at times impose confl  icting imperatives, which  pose engineering challenges and would, among other things,  increase the Company’s costs.
While the Company is pursuing the  development and implementation of various technologies in order  meet the required standards in the various countries in which the  Company sells its vehicles, the costs for compliance with these  required standards could be signifi  cant to its operations and may  materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s business, fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
Imposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to limit the  use of automobiles could signifi  cantly reduce the demand for the  102 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements Company’s products as well as its sales and net income.
Changes in  corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export  and other incentives off ered by the various governments could also  materially and adversely aff  ect the Company’s fi  nancial condition  and results of operations.
For example, the Company currently  benefi  ts from excise duty exemptions for manufacturing facilities in  the State of Uttarakhand and other incentives such as subsidies or  loans from states where the Company has manufacturing operations.
The Government of India has proposed a comprehensive national  goods and services tax, or GST, regime that would combine taxes  and levies by the central and state Governments into one unifi  ed  rate structure.
While both the Government of India and other state  governments of India have publicly announced that all committed  incentives will be protected following the implementation of the  GST, given the limited availability of information in the public  domain concerning the GST, the Company is unable to provide any  assurance as to this or any other aspect of the tax regime following  implementation of the GST.
The implementation of this rationalised  tax structure may be aff ected by any disagreement between certain  state governments, which could create uncertainty.
The Government  of India has publicly announced its intention to implement the GST  on April 1, 2016, however, the Company can make no assurances  regarding this timeline.
In addition, regulations in the areas of investments, taxes and levies  may also have an impact on the price of the Company shares or  ADSs.
The PRC antitrust regulator, the Bureau of Price Supervision  and Anti-Monopoly of the National Development and Reform  Commission, or the NDRC, launched an investigation into the pricing  practices of more than 1,000 Chinese and international companies  in the automotive industry, including Jaguar Land Rover and many  of its competitors, in 2014.
The NDRC has reportedly imposed fi  nes  on certain of the Company’s international competitors as a result  of anti-competitive practices pertaining to vehicle and spare part  pricing.
In response to this investigation, the Company established  a process to review the Company’s pricing in China and, made  reductions in the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for the 5.0  litre V8 models and in the price of certain of the Company spare  parts.
These and other price reductions on the Company products  sold in China may signifi  cantly reduce the Company revenues  and profi  ts generated by operations in China and have a material  adverse eff ect on the Company’s fi  nancial condition and results  of operations.
The Company’s attempts to off  set the potential  decline in revenue and profi  ts by increasing operational effi  ciencies  and leveraging economies of scale (for example, through local  production in China through the Company’s joint venture with  Chery Automobiles) may fail or not be as successful as expected.
Furthermore, any regulatory action taken, or penalties imposed, by  the NDRC or other authorities in China may have signifi  cant severe  reputational consequences on the Company’s business as well as its  profi  tability and prospects.
The Company may be materially and adversely impacted by  politic al instability, wars, terrorism, multinational confl  icts,  natural disasters, fuel shortages/prices, epidemics and labour  strikes.
The Company’s products are exported to a number of geographical  mar kets, and it plans to further expand international operations  in the future.
Consequently, the Company’s operations in those  foreign markets may be subject to political instability, wars,  terrorism, regional or multinational confl  icts, natural disasters, fuel  shortages, epidemics and labour strikes.
In addition, conducting  business internationally, especially in emerging markets, exposes  the Company to additional risks, including adverse changes  in economic and government policies, unpredictable shifts in  regulation, inconsistent application of existing laws, rules and  regulations, unclear regulatory and taxation systems and divergent  commercial and employment practices and procedures.
Any  signifi  cant or prolonged disruption or delay in the Company’s  operations related to these risks could materially and adversely  aff ect its business, fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with new or changing corporate governance  and public disclosure requirements adds unc ertainty to the  Company’s compliance policies and increases compliance costs.
The Company is subject to a complex and changing regime of laws,  rules , regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate  governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and SEC regulations, SEBI regulations, New York Stock  Exchange listing rules and Indian stock market listing regulations.
New or changed laws, rules, regulations and standards may  lack specifi  city and are subject to varying interpretations.
Their  application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance  is provided by regulatory and governing bodies.
As an example,  pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which contains  signifi  cant corporate governance and executive compensation- related provisions, the SEC has adopted additional rules and  regulations in areas such as “say on pay” .
Similarly, under applicable  103 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) Indian laws, for example, remuneration packages may in certain  circumstances require shareholders’ approval.
The Company’s  management and other personnel may be required to devote a  substantial amount of time to such compliance initiatives.
This  could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance  matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing  revisions to such governance standards.
The Company is committed  to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public  disclosure.
However, eff orts to comply with evolving laws, rules,  regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are  likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative  expenses and a diversion of management resources and time.
The Companies Act, 2013 has eff  ected signifi  cant changes to the  existing Indian company law framework, which may subject the  Company to higher compliance requirements and increase its  compliance costs.
A majority of the provisions and rules under the  Companies Act, 2013 have recently been notifi  ed and have come  into eff ect from the date of their respective notifi  cation, resulting  in the corresponding provisions of the Companies Act, 1956  ceasing to have eff ect.
The Companies Act, 2013 has brought into  eff ect signifi  cant changes to the Indian company law framework,  such as in the provisions related to the issue of capital (including  provisions in relation to issue of securities on a private placement  basis), disclosures in off ering documents, corporate governance  norms, accounting policies and audit matters, related party  transactions, introduction of a provision allowing the initiation  of class action suits in India against companies by shareholders  or depositors, a restriction on investment by an Indian company  through more than two layers of subsidiary investment companies  (subject to certain permitted exceptions), prohibitions on loans to  directors and insider trading and restrictions on forward dealing  by directors and key management personnel.
The Company is also  required to spend, in each fi  nancial year, at least 2% of its average  net profi  ts during the three immediately preceding fi  nancial years  towards corporate social responsibility activities.
Furthermore, the  Companies Act, 2013 imposes greater monetary and other liability  on the Company and its directors for any non-compliance.
To  ensure compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act,  2013, the Company may need to allocate additional resources,  which may increase its regulatory compliance costs and divert  management’s attention.
Accordingly, the Company may face  challenges in interpreting and complying with such provisions  due to limited jurisprudence on them.
In the event the Company’s  interpretation of the Companies Act, 2013 diff  ers from, or  contradicts with, any judicial pronouncements or clarifi  cations  issued by the Government in the future, the Company may face  regulatory actions or be required to undertake remedial steps.
Additionally, some of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  overlap with other existing laws and regulations (such as corporate  governance norms and insider trading regulations issued by SEBI).
Recently, SEBI issued revised corporate governance guidelines  which became eff  ective on October 1, 2014.
Pursuant to the  revised guidelines, the Company is required to, among other things,  ensure that there is at least one woman director on the Company  Board of Directors at all times, establish a vigilance mechanism for  directors and employees and reconstitute certain committees in  accordance with the revised guidelines.
The Company may face  diffi  culties in complying with any such overlapping requirements.
Further, the Company cannot currently determine the impact of  certain provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the revised  SEBI corporate governance norms.
Any increase in the Company  compliance requirements or in the Company’s compliance costs  may have an adverse eff ect on the Company’s business, fi  nancial  condition and results of operations.
The Company may be aff ected by competition law in India and  any adverse application or interpretation of the Competition  Act could adversely aff ect the Company’s business.
The Competition Act regulates practices having an appreciable  adv erse eff  ect on competition, or AAEC, in a given relevant  market in India.
Under the Competition Act, any formal or informal  arrangement, understanding or action in concert which causes or is  likely to cause an AAEC is considered void and results in imposition  of substantial penalties.
Consequently, all agreements entered into  by the Company could be within the purview of the Competition  Act.
Further, any agreement among competitors which directly or  indirectly involves determination of purchase or sale prices, limits  or controls production, sharing the market by way of geographical  area or number of subscribers in the relevant market or which  directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging or collusive bidding is  presumed to have an AAEC in the relevant market in India and  is considered void.
The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a  dominant position by any enterprise.
The Company cannot predict  with certainty the impact of the provisions of the Competition Act  on its agreements at this stage.
On March 4, 2011, the Government issued and brought into force  the combination regulation (merger control) provisions under the  Competition Act with eff ect from June 1, 2011.
These provisions  104 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements require acquisitions of shares, voting rights, assets or control or  mergers or amalgamations that cross the prescribed asset- and  turnover-based thresholds to be mandatorily notifi  ed to and pre- approved by the CCI.
Additionally, on May 11, 2011, the CCI issued  Competition Commission of India (Procedure for Transaction  of Business Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 (as  amended), which sets out the mechanism for the implementation  of the merger control regime in India.
Further, the CCI has extraterritorial powers and can investigate  any agreements, abusive conduct or combination occurring  outside India if such agreement, conduct or combination has  an AAEC in India.
The CCI has initiated an enquiry against the  Company and other car manufacturers, collectively referred  to hereinafter as the OEMs, pursuant to an allegation that  genuine spare parts of automobiles manufactured by the OEMs  were not made freely available in the open market in India  and, accordingly, anti-competitive practices were carried out  by the OEMs.
If the Company is aff  ected, directly or indirectly, by the  application or interpretation of any provision of the Competition  Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, or  any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny  or prosecution by the CCI or if any prohibition or substantial  penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely  aff ect the Company’s business, fi  nancial condition and results  of operations.
Compliance with the SEC’s rules for disclosures on “confl  ic t  minerals” may be time consuming and costly as well as result  in reputational damage.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted rules that apply to  companies that use cer tain minerals and metals, known as confl  ict  minerals, in their products, including certain products manufactured  for them by third parties.
The rules require companies to conduct  due diligence as to whether or not such minerals originated from  the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, and  further require companies to fi  le certain information with the SEC  about the use of these minerals.
The Company expects to incur  additional costs to comply with these due diligence and disclosure  requirements.
In addition, depending on the Company’s fi  ndings or  its inability to make reliable fi  ndings about the source of any possible  confl  ict minerals that may be used in any products manufactured  for the Company by third parties, the Company’s reputation could  be harmed.
The Company may be materially and adversely aff ected by RBI  policies and actions.
In June 2015, after the RBI announced an interest rate cut coupled  with a cautious stat ement on infl  ation, the Bombay Sensex dropped  over six hundred (600) points, which may have impacted the price  of the Company’s shares or ADSs.
The Company can make no  assurances about future market reactions to RBI announcements  and their impact on the price of its shares or ADSs.
Furthermore, the  Company’s business could be signifi  cantly impacted were the RBI  to make major alterations to monetary or fi  nancial policy.
Certain  changes, such as the raising of interest rates, could negatively aff ect  the Company’s sales and consequently its revenue, any of which  could have a material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s fi  nancial  condition.
The Indian Securities Market is volatile and could aff  ec t the  Company’s share prices.
Indian stock exchanges, including the BSE, have, in the past,  exper ienced substantial fl  uctuations in the prices of their listed  securities.
The problems, if they continue or recur, could aff  ect the  market price and liquidity of the securities of Indian companies.
These problems have included temporary exchange closures,  broker defaults, settlement delays and strikes by brokers.
In addition,  the governing bodies of the Indian stock exchanges have from  time to time imposed restrictions on trading in certain securities,  limitations on price movements and margin requirements.
Furthermore, from time to time disputes have occurred between  listed companies and stock exchanges and other regulatory  bodies, which, in some cases, may have had a negative eff  ect on  market sentiment.
SEBI received statutory powers in 1992 to assist it in carrying out  its responsibility for improving disclosure and other regulatory  standards for the securities markets.
Subsequently, it has prescribed  regulations and guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements,  insider dealing and other matters relevant to the securities market.
There may, however, not be an adequate level of information  available about companies listed on the Indian stock exchanges.
Political changes in India could delay and/or aff  ect the further  liberalisation of the Indian economy and materially and  adversely aff ect economic conditions in India generally and the  Company’s business in particular.
The Company’s business could be signifi  cantly infl  uenced by  economic policies adopt ed by the Government of India.
Since  105 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) 1991, successive governments have pursued policies of economic  liberalisation and fi  nancial sector reforms.
The Government of  India has at various times announced its general intention to  continue India’s current economic and fi  nancial liberalisation and  deregulation policies.
However, protests against such policies, which  have occurred in the past, could slow the pace of liberalisation and  deregulation.
The rate of economic liberalisation could change,  and specifi  c laws and policies aff  ecting foreign investment,  currency exchange rates and other matters aff ecting investment  in India could change as well.
While the Company expects any  new government to continue the liberalisation of India’s economic  and fi  nancial sectors and deregulation policies, there can be no  assurance that such policies will be continued.
The Government of India has traditionally exercised and continues  to exercise infl  uence over many aspects of the economy.
The  Company’s business and the market price and liquidity of the  Company’s shares may be aff  ected by interest rates, changes in  policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other political, economic  or other developments in or aff ecting India.
In addition, a change in  the Government of India’s economic liberalisation and deregulation  policies could disrupt business and economic conditions in India  generally.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse eff  ect  on the Company’s fi  nancial condition and results of operations.
Terrorist attacks, civil disturbances, regional confl  ic ts and  other acts of violence, particularly in India, may disrupt or  otherwise adversely aff ect the markets in which the Company  operates, the Company’s business and profi  tability.
India has from time to time experienced social and civil  unr est and hostilities, including terrorist attacks, riots and armed  confl  ict with neighbouring countries.
Events of this nature  in the future could infl  uence the Indian economy and could  have a material adverse eff  ect on the Company’s business  as well as the market for securities of Indian companies,  including the Company’s shares and ADSs.
In addition, any  deterioration in international relations, especially between India  and its neighbouring countries, may result in investor concern  regarding regional stability, which could adversely aff ect the  price of the Company shares or ADSs.
Furthermore, India has  witnessed local civil disturbances in recent years, and it is possible  that future civil unrest as well as other adverse social, economic  or political events in India could have an adverse impact on the  Company’s business.
Such incidents could also create a greater  perception that investment in Indian companies involves a  higher degree of risk and could have an adverse impact on the  Company’s business, results of operations and fi  nancial condition,  and the market price of the Company’s shares or ADSs.
Any downgrading of India’s debt rating by a domestic or  international r ating agency could negatively impact the  Company’s business.
Any adverse revisions to India’s credit ratings for domestic  and int ernational debt by domestic or international rating  agencies may adversely impact the Company’s ability to  raise additional fi  nancing as well as the interest rates and  other commercial terms at which such additional fi  nancing is  available.
This could have an adverse eff  ect on the Company  fi  nancial results and business prospects, ability to obtain  fi  nancing for capital expenditures and the price of the Company  shares or ADSs.
The Company will be required to prepare fi  nancial statements  under Ind-AS (which is India’s convergence to IFRS).
The Company currently prepares annual and interim  fi  nancial statements under Indian GAAP and annual fi  nancial  statements under  IFRS.
The Company will be required to prepare  annual and interim fi  nancial statements under Indian Accounting  Standard 101 “First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards” ,  or Ind-AS from April 1, 2016.
Ind-AS diff ers in certain respects from Indian GAAP and IFRS and  therefore fi  nancial statements prepared under Ind-AS may be  substantially diff  erent from fi  nancial statements prepared under  Indian GAAP or IFRS.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s  fi  nancial condition, results of operation, cash fl  ow or changes in  shareholders’ equity will not be presented diff erently under Ind-AS  compared to Indian GAAP or IFRS.
When the Company adopts Ind- AS reporting, it may encounter diffi   culties in the ongoing process  of implementing and enhancing its management information  systems.
There can be no assurance that the adoption of Ind- AS will not adversely aff  ect the Company’s fi  nancial condition or  results of operations.
Business Summary The Company’s business segments are (i) automotive operations  and (ii) all other operations .
The Company’s automotive  operations are further subdivided into Tata and other brand  vehicles (including vehicle fi  nancing) and Jaguar Land  Rover.

Mitigating cyclicality: The automobile industry is impacted by  c yclicality.
To mitigate the impact of cyclicality, the Company plans  to continually strengthen its operations by gaining market share  across diff  erent vehicle categories and off  ering a wide range of  products in diverse geographies.
For example, the Company is  focusing on shifting its off  erings in the defense sector from pure  logistical solutions to tactical and combat solutions, which the  Company believes will be less aff ected by cyclicality.
The Company  also plans to continue to strengthen its business operations other  than vehicle sales, such as fi  nancing of its vehicles, spare part  sales, service and maintenance contracts, sales of aggregates for  non-vehicle businesses, reconditioning of aggregates and sales  of castings, production aids, toolings and fi  xtures, to reduce this  cyclical impact of the automotive industry on the Company’s  fi  nancial performance.
Expanding the Company international business: The Company’s  int ernational expansion strategy involves entering new markets  where it has an opportunity to grow and introducing new products  to existing markets in order to grow its presence in such markets.

For example, in China, Jaguar  Land Rover established a national sales company in 2010 to expand  its presence in this key market and has increased network of sales  dealerships to 189 dealerships as at March 31, 2015.
In addition, Jaguar Land Rover intends to establish new  manufacturing facilities such as the manufacturing facility due to  open in Brazil in 2016.
Jaguar Land Rover also continues to explore  further broadening its international manufacturing base.
Reducing operating costs: The Company’s ability to leverage its  t echnological capabilities and the manufacturing facilities among  its commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle businesses enables  it to reduce costs.
As an example, the diesel engine used in the  Indica platform was modifi  ed for use in the Ace platform, which  helped to reduce development costs.
Similarly, platform sharing  for the manufacture of pickup trucks and utility vehicles enables  the Company to reduce capital investment that would otherwise  be required, while allowing it to improve the utilisation levels at its  manufacturing facilities.
Where it is advantageous for the Company  to do so, it intends to add its existing low-cost engineering and  sourcing capability to vehicles manufactured under the Jaguar and  Land Rover brands.
The Company’s vendor relationships also contribute to cost- reductions.
For example, the Company believes that the vendor  rationalisation program that it is undertaking will provide economies  of scale to its vendors, which would benefi  t the Company’s cost  programmes.
The Company is also undertaking various internal and  external benchmarking exercises that would enable it to improve  the cost eff ectiveness of its components, systems and sub-systems.
The Company has intensifi  ed eff orts to review and realign its cost  structure through a number of measures, such as reduction of  manpower costs and rationalisation of other fi  xed costs.
The Jaguar  Land Rover business has undertaken several cost control and cost  management initiatives, such as increased sourcing of materials  from low-cost countries, reductions in the number of suppliers, the  rationalisation of its marketing eff  orts, a reduction of manpower  costs through increased employee fl  exibility between sites and  several other initiatives.
Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rover is exploring  opportunities through reduction in number of platforms as well as  engineering costs, increased use of off -shoring and several other  initiatives.

The Indian  automobile industry experienced an increase of 2.5% in Fiscal 2015,  as compared to a 9.3% decrease in Fiscal 2014.
Falling crude oil  prices, lower infl  ation, resumption of manufacturing and mining  activities, and lower interest rates appear to be helping the Indian  auto industry revive after two years of decline.
Nevertheless, demand in the light commercial vehicles product  category was aff  ected due to the lack of fi  nancing for potential  customers in Fiscal 2015.
In addition, high default rates for loans  along with early delinquencies has led fi  nanciers to tighten lending  norms—for example, by lowering the loan-to-value ratio on new  fi  nancings and by focusing on collection of existing loans instead  of extending new loans for small commercial vehicles.
This has  impacted the sales volumes for light commercial vehicles overall.

Passenger Vehicles in India Sales in the passenger vehicles industry in India increased by  5.5% in F iscal 2015, compared to a decline of 4.7% in Fiscal  2014.
The growth in sales volumes was refl  ected across both  passenger vehicle categories and was primarily attributable  to reduced fuel prices, improved consumer sentiments, and  lower interest rates.
Hatchback sales remained fl  at, but sedans  continued to show signifi  cant growth with new launches.
The utility vehicle segment has also shown growth,  mainly with strong performances in soft-road SUVs and  multi-purpose vehicles Notwithstanding growth in the Indian passenger vehicle sector, the  Company’s passenger vehicle sales in India decreased by 3.7% to  136,653 units in Fiscal 2015 from 141,846 units in Fiscal 2014, due  to fewer new-product off erings by the Company compared to its  competitors.

However, there  is some evidence of a recovery in the commercial vehicle industry  in India, where volumes grew by 2.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal  2015.
Industry sales in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle  segment increased by 15.9% to 232,103 units in Fiscal 2015 as  compared to sales of 200,261 units in Fiscal 2014 primarily due to  replacements of fl  eet vehicles, which was impacted by stable freight  rates across key routes, lower diesel prices, higher quantities of cargo  transported, a renewal of mining activities in the states of Karnataka  and Goa, a renewal of construction activities, and expectations of  increased investments in infrastructure and manufacturing.
However,  industry sales of light commercial vehicles contracted by 18.1% to  406,902 units in Fiscal 2015 from 496,993 units in Fiscal 2014, mainly  due to lower freight transportation needs due to high-capacity  additions to fl  eets over recent years, fi  nancing defaults and tightened  lending norms, all of which continues to impede the recovery in sales  of light commercial vehicles, particularly small commercial vehicles  sales, which are heavily dependent on funding availability.
Overall, sales of the Company’s commercial vehicles in India  decreased by 15.9% to 317,780 units in Fiscal 2015 from 377,709  units in Fiscal 2014.
The Company’s sales in the medium and heavy  commercial vehicle category increased by 14.9% to 126,369 units  in Fiscal 2015 as compared to sales of 109,984 units in Fiscal 2014.
However, sales in the light commercial vehicles segment declined  by 28.6% to 191,411 units in Fiscal 2015, from 267,925 units in Fiscal  2014, primarily due to the factors aff  ecting the commercial vehicle  market industry-wide.
Tata and other brand vehicles — International Markets The Company’s exports (on standalone basis) remained fl  at at  49,936 units in F iscal 2015, compared to 49,922 units in Fiscal  2014.
The improvement of the geopolitical situation in the South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation region has contributed  to an upsurge in investment in capital goods, which has helped  the Company to improve volumes in this region generally, and  particularly in Bangladesh.
In addition, the launch of new models in  the Middle East and Africa region, along with the opening up of new  markets in these regions, contributed to an increase in international  sales volumes.
The Company’s top fi  ve export destinations for  vehicles manufactured in India that is Bangaladesh, Sri lanka, Nepal,  South africa and Indonesia accounted for approximately 56% and  79% of the exports of commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles,  respectively.
In Fiscal 2015, TDCV’s overall vehicles sales increased by 10.5% to  11,710 units, from 10,600 units in Fiscal 2014.
In the South Korean  116 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements market, TDCV’s sales increased by 3.4% to 6,808 units in Fiscal  2015 from 6,584 units in Fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher sales  in October to December 2014, prompted by emissions norms  eff ective from January 1, 2015.
TDCV exported 4,902 units in Fiscal  2015, compared to 4,016 units in Fiscal 2014, an increase of 22.1%.
Sluggish market conditions in Russia, South Africa, Algeria and  Laos due to adverse sociopolitical conditions were partially off  set  by increases in sales volumes in Vietnam, the Philippines, and UAE.
The Ukraine crisis and fi  nancial sanctions contributed to sluggish  market conditions in Russia, which aff  ected currency exchange rates  and lessened demand for automobiles and for new large projects.
Overall sales in South Africa have been aff ected by the depreciation  of the South African Rand and overall limited economic growth.
In  Algeria and Laos, vehicle demand has been aff  ected by continued  political and economic uncertainties, general economic conditions  and the absence of major projects.
In Vietnam, TDCV has been able  to develop new fl  eet customers to take advantage of a shift in  demand to more lightweight commercial vehicles due to stricter  application of vehicle-weight regulations.
Tata and other brand vehicles — Sales, Distribution and  Suppor t  The sales and distribution network in India as of March 31, 2015  compr ised 3,904 sales and service contact points for passenger  and commercial vehicles sales.
The Company has deployed a  Customer Relations Management, or CRM, system at all the  Company’s dealerships and offi   ces across the country, the largest  such deployment in the automotive market in India.
The combined  online CRM and distributor management system supports users  both within the Company and among distributors in India and  abroad.
The Company’s 100% owned subsidiary, TML Distribution Company  Ltd, or TDCL, acts as a dedicated distribution and logistics  management company to support the sales and distribution  operations of vehicles in India.

Revenue from the Company’s vehicle fi  nancing  operations decreased by 9.4% to `2,742.88 crores in Fiscal 2015  as compared to ` 3,026.47 crores in Fiscal 2014, mainly due to  the generation of fewer automotive-fi  nancing loans in India.
The  decrease in loans was primarily attributable to lower volumes in  the light commercial vehicles category, resulting in a reduction of  fi  nance receivables.
Due to a sluggish economic environment, total disbursements  (including refi  nancing) by TMFL declined by 16.6% in Fiscal 2015  to `7,316 crores as compared to ` 8,768 crores in Fiscal 2014.
TMFL  fi  nanced a total of 112,788 vehicles in Fiscal 2015, refl  ecting a  decline of 28.6% from the 157,886 vehicles fi  nanced in the previous  year.

The Company’s spare parts and after-sales  activity experienced limited growth due to weak sales of both  commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles in recent years.
Tata and other brand vehicles — Competition The Company faces competition from various domestic and  f oreign automotive manufacturers in the Indian automotive  117 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) market.
Improving infrastructure and robust growth prospects  compared to other mature markets has attracted a number of  international companies to India that have either formed joint  ventures with local partners or have established independently  owned operations in India.
Global competitors bring with them  decades of international experience, global scale, advanced  technology and signifi  cant fi  nancial resources, and, as a result,  competition is likely to further intensify in the future.
The  Company has designed its products to suit the requirements  of the Indian market based on specifi  c customer needs such  as safety, driving comfort, fuel-effi  ciency and durability.
The Company believes that its vehicles are suited to the general  conditions of Indian roads and the local climate.

Jaguar Land Rover — Competition  Jaguar Land Rover operates in a globally competitive environment  and faces competition fr om established premium and other  vehicle manufacturers that aspire to move into the premium  performance car and premium SUV markets, some of which  are much larger than the Company.
Jaguar vehicles compete  primarily against other European brands such as Audi, BMW  and Mercedes Benz.
Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles  compete largely against SUVs manufactured by Audi, BMW,  Infi  niti, Lexus, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen.
The Land  Rover Defender competes with vehicles manufactured by Isuzu,  Nissan and Toyota.
Jaguar Land Rover — Seasonality  Jaguar Land Rover sales volume is impacted by the semi-annual  r egistration of vehicles in the United Kingdom where the vehicle  registration number changes every six months, which in turn  has an impact on the resale value of the vehicles.
This leads to a  concentration of sales during the periods when the change occurs.
Seasonality in most other markets is driven by the introduction  of new model year derivatives, for example, in the US market.
Additionally in the US market, there is some seasonality around  the purchase of vehicles in northern states where the purchase of  Jaguar vehicles is concentrated in the spring and summer months,  and the purchase of 4x4 vehicles is concentrated in the autumn/ winter months.
In China there is an increase in vehicle purchases  during the fourth Fiscal quarter, which includes the Chinese New  Year holiday.
Furthermore, western European markets tend to be  impacted by summer and winter holidays.
The resulting sales  profi  le infl  uences operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

This information is given to  enable the readers to understand the performance of Jaguar Land  Rover [on a consolidated basis for the Jaguar Land Rover group] Revenues for Jaguar Land Rover  for Fiscal 2015 were GBP 21,866  million, an increase of 12.8% compared to GBP 19,386 million in  Fiscal 2014, driven primarily by increased wholesale volumes and a  strong product and market mix.
Material and other cost of sales in Fiscal 2015 increased 10.8%  to GBP 13,185 million compared to GBP 11,904 million in Fiscal  2014 primarily due to increased production.
However, it fell as a  proportion of revenue to 60.3% as compared to 61.4% in Fiscal  2014, due to a favorable product and market mix.
Employee costs increased by 19.5% to GBP 1,977 million in Fiscal  2015 as compared to GBP 1,654 million in Fiscal 2014.
This was  driven by headcount increases in manufacturing (due to production  increases) and in product development as Jaguar Land Rover  continued to expand its future product portfolio.
Wage increases  agreed at the latest round of pay negotiations in November 2014,  also contributed to a rise in employee costs during the year.
Other expenses increased by 10.6% to GBP 4,109 million in Fiscal  2015 compared to GBP 3,717 million in Fiscal 2014, as costs related  to manufacturing, freight and distribution, warranty, product  development, selling and fi  xed marketing grew to support Jaguar  Land Rover’s growth and launch costs increased as the products  were brought to market partially off set by realized foreign exchange  and commodity gains.
Product development costs capitalized  increased by 12.4% to  GBP 1,158 million in Fiscal 2015 compared to GBP 1,030 million in  Fiscal 2014.
This is due to increased expenditure on the development  of more future products and technologies to support the future  growth of Jaguar Land Rover’s product portfolio.

HUMAN RESOURCES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS The Company considers its human capital a critical factor to its  140 Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview 70th Annual Report 2014-15 Financial Statements success.
Under the aegis of Tata Sons and the Tata Sons promoted  entities, the Company has drawn up a comprehensive human  resource strategy which addresses key aspects of human resource  development such as:  The code of conduct and fair business practices;  A  fair  and  objective  performance  management  system   linked  to  the  performance  of  the  businesses  which   identifi  es  and diff erentiates employees by performance level;  Creation of a common pool of talented managers across Tata  Sons and the Tata Sons promoted entities with a view to  increasing their  mobility  through job  rotation among the   entities;  Evolution of performance based compensation packages to  attract and retain talent within Tata Sons and the Tata Sons  promoted entities; and  Development of comprehensive training programs to improve  industry- and function-specifi  c skills.

of Employees India 43,313 43,986 Abroad 30,172 24,903 Total 73,485 68,889 Union Wage Settlements:  The Company has labour unions for  operative grade employees at all its plant across India, except at  Sanand and Dharwad plant, which do not have unions as of the  date of this Annual Report.
The Company has generally enjoyed  cordial relations with its employees at its factories and offi  ces.
Employee wages are paid in accordance with wage agreements  that have varying terms (typically three years) at diff erent locations.
The expiration dates of the wage agreements with respect to  various locations/subsidiaries are as follows Location/subsidiaries Wage Agreement valid until Pune Commercial vehicles August 31, 2015 Pune Passenger vehicles March 31, 2016 Jamshedpur March 31, 2016 Mumbai December 31, 2015 Lucknow March 31, 2017 Pantnagar March 31, 2015 Jaguar Land Rover October 31, 2016 The wage agreement at Pantnagar has expired and negotiations  are in progress for the new wage agreement.
The Pune Commercial  Vehicles agreement expires in the month of August 2015 and  preparations for the new agreement are underway.
The Company’s  wage agreements link an employee’s compensation to certain  performance criteria that are based on various factors such as quality,  productivity, operating profi  t and an individual’s performance and  attendance.
The Company has generally received union support in  its implementation of reforms that impact quality, cost erosion and  productivity improvements across all locations.
In South Korea, the Company’s union employees had fi  led a lawsuit  to include some elements of non-ordinary salary and bonus as part  of “ordinary wages” for the period December 2007 to May 2011.
The district court ruled in favor of the union employees on January  2013 and ordered TDCV to pay the employees KRW 17.2 billion  and interest, up to the period of lawsuit.
The Company recorded a  provision of KRW 45.8 billion as at March 31, 2014, in respect of this  lawsuit and consequential obligation for all employees (including  non-union employees).
TDCV had fi  led an appeal against the order  to High Court, which gave its verdict on December 24, 2014.
The  High Court, following the decision of the Supreme Court in a case  of an unaffi   liated company, determined that some elements of  non-ordinary salary were part of “ordinary wages” and the need to  141 Notice Directors’ Report Management Discussion & Analysis Corporate Governance Secretarial Audit Report (92-141) be paid with retrospective eff  ect.
However, based on the “Good  Faith Principle” and because any retrospective payment would  have high fi  nancial impact on the Company, the court determined  that the bonuses and work performance salary would be eligible  for retrospective payment.
Accordingly, the total liability was  determined at KRW 99 million (`0.57 crore) and interest of KRW 20  million (`0.12 crore) thereon.
The Union employees had period of  up to January 27, 2015 to appeal to the Supreme Court of South  Korea, which was not exercised.
Furthermore, in order to maintain the claim for the period from  June 2011 to March 2014, TDCV union employees fi  led a case in  the Seoul district court on November 24, 2014.
In addition to the  items included in the fi  rst lawsuit, one new item for additional  50% allowance for over time on Holiday (Saturday and Sunday)  was added.
However, after receipt of the fi  nal judgment of the  Seoul High Court for the fi  rst lawsuit, which was not in their favour,  the labor union decided to withdraw the second lawsuit and  submitted the Case withdrawal confi  rmation on March 19, 2015.
Accordingly, the provision created as at March 31, 2014 has been  reversed in Fiscal 2015.
OUTLOOK The Company expects that the M&HCV Truck segment in India will  lik ely register a growth in Fiscal 2016, driven by continuing trends  towards the replacement of ageing fl  eet vehicles and expectations  of increases in demand from the infrastructure and industrial sectors  due to reforms being initiated by the Government of India.
The  Company expects that the demand for new commercial vehicles  will also be driven by gradual acceptance of advance trucking  platforms, the progression to Bharat Stage V emissions norms and  the introduction of technologies, such as anti-lock braking systems.
The Company expects that faster growth and improved consumer  sentiments should boost sales of passenger cars and utility vehicles  in India.
The improved sales outlook for utility vehicles, cars, buses and  trucks comes against the backdrop of the Government of India’s  annual budget proposal to raise investment in infrastructure,  including roads and railways.
The Company expects infrastructure  investment to be allocated to rural areas which will lead to increased  automotive demand.
The Company expects that, due to pressures on volumes in India  and limited headrooms in pricing, due to the intensely competitive  market dynamics, the focus will be on eff  ective cost management  to maintain margins.
Even in this challenging environment, as  envisioned in its Mission statement, the Company is looking to  “passionately anticipate” and provide vehicles and solutions that  “excite customers globally” .
The objective remains to be the “most  admired” Company by all stakeholders.
One of the key elements of this strategy is to improve the  relationship with the customer – the experience the customer has  with the Company at each touch point from sale to service and  replacement sales experiences.
This strategy includes, among other  things, improving the physical appearances of contact points with  customers and the creation of processes and forums for speedy  resolution of customer issues.
The Company will also actively pursue growth in the right  international markets and aims to consolidate its position in markets  where it is already present.
Continued investment, by Jaguar Land Rover, in new products  and technologies as well as expanding its production capacity in  appropriate strategic locations, while balancing production with  sales, is key for the success of the Company.

Significant accounting policies          (a) Basis of preparation     The financial statements of the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention on an accrual basis of accounting in accor dance with the  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India to comply with the Accounting Standards notified under Section 133 of Compani es Act, 2013 read with  Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 2013 Act”).
(b) U se of estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the application of accounting  policies and the r eported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of these financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Re visions to accounting  estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods affected.
(c) Rev enue recognition     The Company recognises revenues on the sale of products, net of discounts and sales incentives, when the products are delivered t o the dealer / customer   or when delivered to the carrier for export sales, which is when risks and rewards of ownership pass to the dealer / customer.
Sales include income from services,  and exchange fluctuations relating to export receivables.
Sales include export and other recurring and non-recurring  incentives from the Government at the national and state levels.
Sale of products is presented gross of excise duty where applicable, and net of other indirect  taxes.
Revenues are recognised when collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured.
Dividend from investments is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established and when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or   collectability exists.
Interest income is recognized on the time basis determined by the amount outstanding and the rate applicable and where no significant uncertainty as  to measurability or collectability exists.

F-11 NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Independent Auditors’ Report Balance Sheet (F-10 - F-46) Statement of Profit and Loss Cash Flow Statement Notes to Accounts (f ) Impairment      At each Balance Sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that the fixed assets with finite lives may be impair ed.
If any such   indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where it is not possible to   estimate the recoverable amount of individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the  asset belongs.
As of March 31, 2015 none of the fixed assets were considered impaired.
(g) L eases       (i) Finance lease      Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the     assets and the  present  value of minimum lease payments.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a    constant  periodic rate of  interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets given under finance leases are recognised as receivables at an amount    equal  to the net investment in the lease and the finance income is based on a constant rate of return on the outstanding net investment.
(ii) Oper ating lease       Leases other than finance lease, are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet.
P ayments under  operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(h) Transactions in foreign currencies and accounting of derivatives            (i) Ex change differences      Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currenc y monetary assets and    liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates.
(1) Exchange differences arising on settlement of transactions and translation of monetary items other than those covered by (2) below are recognized  as income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Exchange differences considered as borrowing cost are capitalized to the extent these relate to  the acquisition / construction of qualifying assets and the balance amount is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(2) Exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency monetary assets / liabilities are accounted for with effect from April 1, 2007 in the  following manner:           - Differences relating to borrowings attributable to the acquisition of the depreciable capital asset are added to / deducted from the cost of such capital  assets.
- Other differences were accumulated in Foreign Currency Monetary Item Translation Difference Account and amortized over the pe riod, beginning  April 1, 2007 or date of inception of such item, as applicable, and ending on March 31, 2011 or the date of its maturity, whichever was earlier.
- Pursuant to notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on December 29, 2011, the exchange differences on long te rm foreign currency  monetary items (other than those relating to acquisition of depreciable assets) are amortised over the period till the date of maturity or March 31,  2020, whichever is earlier.
(ii) Hedge ac counting      The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating t o highly probable  forecast transactions.
With effect from April 1, 2008, the Company designates such forward contracts in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the  hedge accounting principles set out in Accounting Standard 30- Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These forward contracts are stated at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of these forward and option contracts that are  designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognized directly in Hedging Reserve Account under Reserves and Surplus, net of  applicable deferred income taxes and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Amounts accumulated in Hedging Reserve Account are reclassified to Profit and Loss in the periods during which the forecasted transaction occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
For forecasted transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is retained there until the  forecasted transaction occurs.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is immediately  transferred to the Profit and Loss Statement.
Foreign currency options and other derivatives are stated at fair value as at the year end with changes in fair  value recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
(iii) Premium or discount on forward contracts other than those covered in (ii) above is amortised over the life of such contracts and is recognised as income  or expense.
(i) Product warranty expenses      The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold.
These estimates are established using histo r ical information on the nature,  frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product  failures.
The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise - being typically up to 3 to 4 years.

Though the Company continues to rigorously press its rights, contentions and claims in the matter,  the Company has been advised that the time it may take in disposal of the appeal is uncertain.
The Company has also been advised that it has a  good case and can strongly defend the appeal, but the questions that arise are issues of constitutional law and thus the result of the appeal cannot  be predicted.
In these circumstances, in view of the uncertainty on the timing of resolution, following the course of  prudence, the management has  during the year ended March 31, 2015, made a provision for carrying capital cost of buildings at Singur amounting to `309.88 crores included under  the head “works operations and other expenses” excluding other assets (electrical installations etc.)
and expenses written off  / provided in earlier  years, security expenses, lease rent and claim for interest on the whole amount (including `309.88 crores).
The Company shall however continue to  pursue the case and assert its rights and its claims in the Courts.

(b) Use of estimates       The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect the a pplication of  accounting policies and the r eported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of these  financial statements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

(b ) Depreciation and Amortisation              (i) Depreciation is provided on the Straight Line Method (SLM) over the estimated useful lives of the assets consi der ing the nature, estimated usage,  operating conditions, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturer warranties and maintenance support.
Taking in to  account these factors, the Company and its domestic group companies have decided to retain the useful life hitherto adopted for various categories  of fixed assets, which are different from those prescribed in Schedule II of the Act.
Estimated useful lives of assets of the group are as follows :          Type of Asset Estimated useful life      Leasehold Land  amor tised over the period of the lease      Buildings, Roads, Bridge and culverts        4 to 60 years      Plant, machinery and equipment         8 to 30 years      Computers and other IT assets   3 to 6 years      Vehicles  3 to 10 years      Furniture, fixtures and office appliances    3 to 20 years      Technical know-how  2 to 10 years      Developed technologies  10 years      Computer software  1 to 8 years      Special tools are amortised on a straight line basis over the lives of the model concerned, which is 7 to 10 years.
(ii)  Capital assets, the ownership of which does not vest with the Company, other than leased assets, are depreciated over the  estimated period of their  utility or five years, whichever is less.
(iii) Product development costs are amortised over a period of upto 120 months for New Generation vehicles and power trains on the basis of highest  of the volumes between planned  and actuals and on a Straight Line method over a period of 36 months for Vehicle Variants, Deri vatives and other  Regulatory Projects.
(iv)  In respect of assets whose useful life has been revised, the unamortised depreciable amount has been charged over the r evised remaining useful life.
(v)  Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress / intangible assets under development until construction and installation are complete and    asset is ready for its intended use.
(c) Fixed Assets   (i) Fixed assets are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation / amortisation.
(ii)  The product development cost incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognised as  fixed assets, when  feasibility has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and it is probable  that the asset will generate probable future benefits.
(iii)  Cost includes purchase price, taxes and duties, labour cost and directly attributable overhead expenditure for self co nstructed assets and other direct  costs incurred upto the date the asset is ready for its intended use.
Borrowing cost incurred for qualifying assets is capitalised up to the date the asset  is ready for intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no  specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
The cost of acquisition is further adjusted for exchange differences relating to long term foreign  currency borrowings attributable to the acquisition of depreciable asset w.e.f.
April 1, 2007.
(iv)  Heritage assets are measured at cost and not depreciated as they are considered to have useful economic life in excess of 50 years.
An annual  impairment review is performed and any impairment in the carrying value is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(v)  Software not exceeding `25,000 and product development costs relating to minor product enhancements, facelifts and upgrades are charged off to    the Statement of Profit and Loss as and when incurred.
F-59  (d) Impairment of Tangible Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill   At each Balance Sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that the tangible assets, intangible assets including Goodwilll ma y be  impaired.
If any such impairment indicators exists, the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where  it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of t he cash-generating unit to  which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated  first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of carrying amount of  each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent peroid unless there are changes in external events.
As of  March 31, 2015, none of the tangible and intangible assets were considered impaired except for amounts disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements.
(e) Leases              (i) Finance lease       Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the pr esent value of minimum  lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to periods  during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets given under finance leases are recognised  as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease and the finance income is based on a constant rate of return on the outstanding  net investment.
(ii) Oper ating lease     Leases other than finance lease are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet.
P ayments    under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(f ) Transactions in foreign currencies and accounting of derivatives   (i) Exchange differences     Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign cur rency monetary assets and     liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates.
(1)  Exchange differences arising on settlement of transactions and translation of monetary items other than those covered b y (2) below are  recognised as income or expense in the year in which they arise.

(ii) Hedge accounting    The C ompany uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast  transactions.
With effect from April 1, 2008, the Company designates such forward contracts in a cash flow hedging relationship by applying the hedge  accounting principles set out in Accounting Standard 30- Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
These forward contracts are stated at fair value at each reporting date.
Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts  that are designated and effective  as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in Hedging Reserve Account under Reserves and Surplus, net of applicable deferred income taxes and  the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Amounts accumulated in Hedging Reserve Account are reclassified to profit and loss in the same periods during which the forecas ted transaction affects  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
For  forecasted transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is retained there until the forecasted  transaction occurs.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in Hedging Reserve Account is immediately transferred  to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
(iii) Premium or discount on forward contracts other than those covered in (ii) above is amortised over the life of such contracts and is recognised as income or  expense.
(g) Product warranty expenses    The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold.
These estimates are established using hist orical information on the nature,  frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on corrective actions on product  failures.
The timing of outflows will vary as and when warranty claim will arise - being typically upto five years.
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Independent Auditors’ Report Balance Sheet Statement of Profit and Loss Cash Flow Statement Notes to Accounts (F-56 - F-90) Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-60 (Consolidated) 70th Annual Report 2014-15  (h) Income on vehicle loan    I nterest income from loan contracts in respect of vehicles and income from plant given on lease, are accounted for by using the  Internal Rate of Return  method.
Consequently, a constant rate of return on the net outstanding amount is accrued over the period of contract.
The Company provides an allowance  for finance receivables based on the prudential norms issued by the RBI relating to income recognition, assets classification and  non-performing assets as  early implemented by the company.
In addition to the provisioning as per the RBI norms, provision is also being made for the anticipated loss to be incurred  by the company on resale of repossessed vehicles.
(i) Sale of finance receivables    One of the subsidiary sells finance receivables to Special Purpose Entities (“SPE”) in securitisation transactions.
Recourse is in the f orm subsidiary’s investment in  subordinated securities issued by these special purpose entities, cash collateral and bank guarantees.
The loans are derecognised in the balance sheet when they are sold  and consideration has been received by the subsidiary.
Sales and transfers that do not meet the criteria for surrender of control are accounted for as secured borrowings.
The subsidiary company hitherto made provision on assigned / securitised receivables in the same manner as done for finance rece ivables based on the  prudential norms issued by the RBI relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning for non-performing assets.
In addition to the provisioning  as per the RBI norms, provision is also made for the anticipated non recoverable principal, where any of the installments are overdue for a period exceeding 11  months.
During the year, the subsidiary has revised its accounting policy for recording loss on securitised receivables in line with RBI’s securitization guidelines  and RBI’s observations.
The subsidiary is of the opinion that the change would reflect a more appropriate presentation of the financial statements and also  would be in line with the RBI observations.
As per the new policy the subsidiary records loss on such receivables to the extent of utilization / draw down of the  credit enhancement by writing-off the amount to the statement of profit and loss as per RBI Guidelines and has discontinued with the provision on securitised  receivables.
Had the subsidiary followed its earlier policy the profit for the year and the Reserves as at March 31, 2015 would have been lower by `29.50 crores.
Gains or losses from the sale of loans are recognised in the period the sale occurs based on the relative fair value of the portion sold and the portion allocated to  retained interests, except for subsidiaries which are governed by prudential norms for income recognition issued by the Reserve Bank of India  for Non Banking  Financial Companies (NBFC), where gains or losses on sale are accounted for as per these norms.
The estimated liability for servicing expenses in respect of assigned receivables is made based on the ratio between the cost incurred for servicing current  receivables and the collection made during the year.
(j) Inventories    Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of raw materials and consumables are ascertained on a moving w eighted average /  monthly moving weighted average basis, except for Jaguar and Land Rover which is on FIFO basis.
Cost, including variable and fixed overheads, are allocated to  work-in-progress and finished goods determined on full absorption cost basis.

Contributions to the plans by the subsidiary group take into consideration the results of actuarial valuations.
The plans w ith a surplus position at the  year end have been limited to the maximum economic benefit available from unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future  contributions.
Where the subsidiary group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting value of the  liabilities, an onerous obligation is recognised.
During the year ended and as at March 31, 2015, ` 2,793.47 crores (debit) (net of tax) and ` 10,361.85 crores (debit) (net of tax) respectively have been  accounted, to “Reserves and Surplus” , representing changes in actuarial valuation of pension plans of a subsidiary company in the UK, in accordance  with IFRS principles and as permitted by AS 21 in the consolidated financial statements.

(d) Capital work-in-progress as at March 31, 2014 included building under construction at Singur in West Bengal of `309.88 crores for the purposes  of manufacturing automobiles.
In October 2008, the Company moved the Nano project from Singur in West Bengal to Sanand in Gujarat.
In June  2011, the newly elected Government of West Bengal (State Government) enacted a law cancelling the land lease agreement at Singu r, and took  over possession of the land.
The Company challenged the constitutional validity of the law.
In June 2012, the Calcutta High Court declared the law  unconstitutional and restored Company’s rights under the land lease agreement.
The State Government filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of  India in August 2012, which is pending disposal.
Though the Company continues to rigorously press its rights, contentions and claims in the matter,  the Company has been advised that the time it may take in disposal of the appeal is uncertain.
The Company has also been advised that it has a  good case and can strongly defend the appeal, but the questions that arise are issues of constitutional law and thus the result of the appeal cannot  be predicted.
In these circumstances, in view of the uncertainty on the timing of resolution, following the course of  prudence, the management has  during the year ended March 31, 2015, made a provision for carrying capital cost of buildings at Singur amounting to `309.88 crores included under  the head “works operations and other expenses” excluding other assets (electrical installations etc.)
and expenses written off /  provided in earlier  years, security expenses, lease rent and claim for interest on the whole amount (including `309.88 crores).
The Company shall however continue to  pursue the case and assert its rights and its claims in the Courts.
(e)  The Company has a process whereby periodically all long term contracts (including derivative contracts) are assessed for material foreseeable losses.
At the year end, the Company has reviewed and ensured that adequate provision as required under any law / accounting standards for material  foreseeable losses on such long term contracts (including derivative contracts) has been made in the books of accounts.
