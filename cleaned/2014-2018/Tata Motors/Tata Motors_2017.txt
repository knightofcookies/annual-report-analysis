The automotive industry is going through multiple  changes from different dimensions – changing regulatory  and environmental standards as well as technological  disruptions and the industry is also witnessing   increased competition.
From your Company’s point of view JLR has posted  an excellent performance but the performance of  the domestic segment has been a major concern.
The commercial vehicle segment has witnessed a  continued decline in market share and the passenger car  performance has been muted.
Our consolidated net revenues declined by 1.2% to  `269,850 crore for the 12 months to March 31st, 2017 and  our consolidated profit before tax for the year fell sharply  to `9,315 crore, compared with `14,126 crore in the prior  year.
Our standalone net revenues increased by 3.7% to  `44,477 crore for the 12 months to March 31st, 2017 and  our standalone loss before tax for the year fell to `2,421  crore, compared with `67 crore in the prior year.
Jaguar Land Rover represents world-class quality, reliability  and performance through its exceptional product range.
The Company delivered a 9.2% increase in full year  revenues to GBP 24.3 billion in the last financial year, and  reported pre-tax profits up 3.4% at GBP 1.6 billion.
In the domestic market, the market share in both the  Commercial Vehicles and Passenger Vehicles have declined  significantly.
The market share for CV segment has fallen  to 44.4% from a high of 59.4% in FY 2011-12, while market  share for PV declined to 5.2% from 13.1% in the same  period.
Overall, delays in new product launches as well  as lack of adequate responsiveness to the competitive  environment and an unsustainable cost structure have  contributed to this performance.
In the domestic business segment, business turnaround   is the need of the hour and management is working   We have to bring a renewed focus and  energy to  improve our market share, reduce our cost base,  streamline our supply chain and ensure timely  delivery of new products to market.
11 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 I am confident that  the series of actions  being taken by the  management team  will succeed and  show an improved  performance in both  the commercial  vehicle and  passenger vehicle  segments in India  and deliver better  financial results.
with renewed focus and energy to improve  our market share, reduce our cost base,  streamline the supply chain and ensure  launch of products on time to delight   our customers.
I am confident that the series of actions being  taken by the management team will succeed  and show an improved performance in both  the commercial vehicle and passenger   vehicle segments in India and deliver better  financial results.
I would like to thank our employees as well  as our extended partners, including dealers,  suppliers and other stakeholders for their hard  work and commitment in this critical phase of  Tata Motors.
Finally, I thank you for your continued trust,  confidence and support.
Best Regards,  N Chandrasekaran  Mumbai, May 23, 2017  12 CORPORATE OVERVIEW Dear Shareholders, When I joined almost a year and a half ago,  there was an immediate need to launch  a transformation journey, setting the  long-term priorities for the organisation,  redefining the MVV (Mission, Values, and  Vision), laying down the blueprint for  CV & PV business strategy till 2020, and  launching our strategic game plan with  high impact projects for bottom-line/  top-line improvement – all leading to a  robust business plan for the FY 16-17.
With  this background, we set ourselves towards  aspirational targets in terms of market share  and financials.
On June 20, 2016, we kick-started  our transformation journey to be  'FUTUREADY' , to instill a sense of the ‘very  purpose’ for the organisation’s existence,  which immediately caught up with the  organisation.
The ImpACT (Improvement  by Action) projects with full time senior  leaders and dedicated teams having  ownership at ExCom level helped us focus  on four angles of attack – intense top-line  focus, cost optimisation, customer centricity  and structural improvements in processes.
These projects have started to payback and  have created a great change of momentum  in the entire organisation.
We have built a  very strong savings potential with positive  effects in FY 17-18 and the years to come.
One of the most important initiatives in   FY 16-17 was the Organisational  Effectiveness (OE) exercise, with the  objective of bringing the much needed  empowerment and accountability within  the BUs, strong functional oversight based  on the key principles of speed, simplicity and  agility.
Due to its magnitude and complexity,  the transition of the new management  TML MD'S  MESSAGE structure w.e.f.
April 01, 2017 faced some  challenges, which in the meanwhile are  getting addressed on a case-to-case basis.
Due to the unexpected and unprecedented  changes in the market, we faced a rather  hostile business cycle with headwinds in  the form of demonetisation and the famous  Supreme Court ruling on BS IV transition.
As  a matter of fact, it was not only the market  volatility which affected our performance,  but mainly our sluggishness in reading the  market in time, as we were effectively late to  respond.
While we have made great progress as  far as the transformation journey in terms  of setting the missing direction for the  organisation, we are cognisant of the  misses on the operational side where we  have delivered significantly below our  expectations.
There is an immediate need for  action in order to refocus the organisation  on regaining market share in commercial  vehicles and bringing accelerated efforts  in cost reduction in order to drive business  profitability.
I would like to take this  opportunity to commit to a stretched plan  in FY 17-18 thereby compensating on  our poor performance in FY 16-17 with a  promise of a better year.
Our immediate  priority now is on execution - to address  the top concerns of supply constraints,  to advance the launch time of some of  our new products.
In full alignment with  the board, we have finalised a business  turnaround plan through which we take  upon ourselves to deliver a robust bottom- line improvement in FY 17-18.
In conclusion, I would say that we have  immense opportunities, and we are  optimistic about the outlook for Tata Motors.
We will keep you posted on our progress  along the journey in this crucial year.
Looking forward to your continued  support, as we put in our best to meet your  expectations!
Best Regards,  Guenter Butschek  Mumbai, May 23, 2017 13 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 JLR CEO’S   MESSAGE Dear Shareholders, Our customers are at the heart of everything  we do.

The EU is a  business opportunity.
There is no credible  alternative.
THE FUTURE With significant global economic growth  forecasts for the coming years, we are  cautiously optimistic that we can exploit the  growing premium demand.
At Jaguar Land Rover, we are committed  to growing our business responsibly  and in ways that benefit broader society.
Creating our own future in the world we  want to live in.
The pace of change has never been greater.
Our aim is to set it.
This is a time of great  change.
Time for Jaguar Land Rover.

For details of all risks, please refer to the Risk Factors in the  Management Discussion & Analysis section.
CONTEXT The Company (including  JLR) has initiated several  programmes to optimise its  operating efficiencies and  implements its strategic  roadmap.
These programmes may not  deliver projected efficiencies  and anticipated benefits may  not accrue as expected.
JLR’s expanding global  presence increases its  exposure to multiple  geopolitical challenges which  may impact its business.
India’s automotive industry  may be affected by the  general economic conditions  nationally and internationally.
The Company (including  JLR) is subject to a rapidly  evolving regulatory landscape  around environmental issues  such as, CO2 emissions  and fuel economy.
These  developments impact all  our products as well as the  manufacturing facilities.
The Company has to  migrate to BS VI in India from  April 1, 2020.
This entails  challenges in the adaptation  of technologies, innovations  relating to manufacturing,  testing and validation to the  new standards.
The global automotive  industry (including India)  is highly competitive and  competition is likely to  further intensify following the  continuing globalisation and  consolidation.
Brand positioning is becoming  increasingly challenging as the  dynamics of the automotive  market (i.e.
automated  driving, electrification,  digital connectivity) and  the competitive pressures  from existing automotive  manufacturers and new  disruptive entrants evolve.
The fast pace of technological  development together with  scarcity of specialist resources  could result in a significant  change in the automotive  industry and increase the risk  of delivering superior products  demanded by current and  future customers.
New and emerging  technologies bring  unprecedented threats to  internet connected devices  including vehicles and recent  global hacking incidents  impacting the geopolitical  environment indicate an  increase in the motivation to  instigate cyber attacks.

Intensifying   Competition and  Brand Positioning Technological  Disruption Information and   Cyber Security 2972nd Annual Report 2016-17 CONTEXT The Company’s operations are  subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates  with reference to countries  in which it operates.
The  Company imports capital  equipment, raw materials  and components from,  manufacture vehicles in, and  sell vehicles into, various  countries, and therefore, its  revenues and costs have  significant exposure to  the relative movements of  currencies of those countries.
Also, the Company has an  outstanding foreign currency  denominated debt and is  sensitive to fluctuations in  foreign currency exchange  rates.
The Company (including  JLR) is subjected to risks  and costs associated with  product liability, warranties  and recalls in connection with  performance, compliance or  safety-related issues affecting  the Company’s products  which may, in turn, cause  the Company’s customers  to question the safety or  reliability of its vehicles and  thus result in a materially  adverse effect on its business.
International expansion  exposes the Company and  its subsidiaries to increased  diversity and complexity of  legal and other frameworks  in a variety of jurisdictions.
Therefore, the Company  and its subsidiaries become  subject to maintaining legal  and ethical standards globally.
The Company’s and its  subsidiaries’ substantial R&D  investment generates   IP and the protection of this  IP is necessary to prevent its  unauthorised third-party use.
Conversely, the Company and  its subsidiaries need to ensure  that it does not infringe the IP  of third parties.
CAPITALS  IMPACTED MITIGA- TION Currency transaction risk  is managed with financial  derivatives in line with the  hedging policy approved  by the Company’s and its  respective subsidiaries’ Board.
Also, JLR aims to align  its sourcing base with its  global sales profile and the  revaluation of  some of its  US Dollar debt provides a  natural offset to its US Dollar  receivables.
Further, the Company hedges  its foreign currency debt as  per its hedging policy.
The Company (including  JLR) regularly monitor the  service data of its vehicles to  proactively manage recalls and  minimise warranty claims.
Jaguar Land Rover also issues  technical updates to its dealer  network to manage identified  faults and defects.
The Company’s code  of conduct sets out the  behaviours that the Company  expects of its staff, including  conforming to the highest  moral and ethical standards  and complying with  applicable laws, including  anti-bribery, corruption and  competition laws, sanctions  and export controls.
TML and its subsidiaries have   in-house specialists, who  manage matters relating to  IP and ensure that robust  processes are followed by  means of patents, registered  designs, trademarks and  copyrights.

49 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS Initiatives on building sustainable relationships with our supply  chain partners Jaguar Land Rover’s supply chain is complex and growing in line  with our international expansion  In FY 2017, TML has engaged with 105  top suppliers who have reported on their  environmental, social and governance  performance.
In addition, we conducted  site assessment of 52 suppliers and the  combined performance is given below: Our ‘Project Sankalp’ benefits bottom-of-the- pyramid supplier partners in the areas   of quality, productivity and profitability  through capability building, elimination of  waste (rework, rejections, transit damages,  etc.)
conservation of resources and a  better work environment thereby ensuring  business continuity.
Automobile companies have a complex  supply chain.
The automobile supply chains  can be broadly classified into - Direct  Material Suppliers (auto components  fitted on vehicle) and Indirect Material  Suppliers (consumables such as paint,  pre-treatment chemicals gases, etc.
used in  the manufacturing process as well as other  materials required for supporting processes).
The other key component of the automobile  value chain includes sales & marketing  and after sales service to ensure a superior  customer experience through dealers and  service touch points.
We engage with our channel partners as  well as suppliers very closely.
We believe  partnering with our suppliers and dealers for  sharing knowledge and developing capacity,  will add to our cost efficiency and ensure an  enhanced customer experience.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  Supply Chain programme is an important  global platform for engaging with suppliers  to help businesses decarbonise and  strengthen their own resilience.
JLR's UK supply chain has grown strongly,  matching its growth story.
UK-sourced  components have increased to 50%, creating  GBP 3.5 billion per annum of additional UK  contracts, supporting 200,000 jobs   and taking its total annual manufacturing  spend with UK suppliers to more than  GBP 6.5 billion.
In the last five years, JLR's  investment has generated more than 60,000  new jobs in the UK supply chain.
50 CORPORATE OVERVIEW A COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY Conservation of natural resources has always   been a priority for Tata Motors.
We strive to  minimise the impact of our operations on the  natural environment.
Depending upon stakeholder engagement outcomes and materiality  assessment, we formulate our Sustainability Strategy and prioritise  actions towards addressing the Material Environmental Issues.
Our  efforts on environmental conservation are governed by the   Board-level Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee, which  monitors and reviews our environmental performance.
The key environmental issues which we prioritise and act upon are: RESOURCE CONSERVATION   Resource optimisation is of prime  importance.
There are multiple financial and  non-financial benefits, which are associated  with resource optimisation.
Not only does  it lead to reduction in vehicular weight, fuel  efficiency and generated waste, it leads to  significant cost savings.
At TML, we achieved a significant reduction  in steel and ferrous alloy consumption  in FY 2016-17, compared to FY 2015-16,  even though there has been an increase in  production by 0.28%.
We are continuously  seeking to optimise material usage  and recycling to avoid virgin material  consumption through initiatives, such as  using high-strength steel and alternate  engineering plastic.
Through Tata OK and Tata Assured initiative  and our reconditioning business, Prolife, we  are extending the life of our products, while  ensuring optimum operational performance  and minimising the usage of virgin materials.
14,058 Number of vehicles   refurbished and sold  JAGUAR LAND ROVER   Closed Loop Process  Continuing its efforts of building closed-loop  systems, JLR has changed the way it works  by collecting the surplus aluminium from  its body-stamping process and reusing it  to make new vehicles.
This has helped in  achieving Zero Waste to Landfill by 2016.
CIRCULAR ECONOMY   While we are complying with waste  management laws in our respective  geographies, we are actively working  towards adopting the principles of    ‘Circular Economy’ .
This initiative will help   us transform our approach towards   waste management.
It will build synergies  among different functions such as design,  materials sciences, engine technologies;   and also present opportunities from   new business streams.
44,069  Total volume of product   recycled/reused in   take-back programme In one year alone, JLR reclaimed 50,000+  tonnes of press shop aluminium waste  which was enough to make around 200,000  Jaguar XE body shells.
The company is now  applying this process to other materials.
Natural or sustainable materials As a member of the Lightweight And Sound  consortium (LANDS), JLR has been involved  in a three-year project to find material  replacements that use recycled content  and that are suitable for current production  methods.
The work JLR is doing with its  LANDS partners has confirmed that natural  or sustainable materials can meet current  automotive standards and be manufactured  successfully – an important step towards  further environmental improvements across  the vehicle life cycle.
51 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 Water consumption has been identified as one of our key  sustainability issues.
The water demand at nearly all our operational  locations is significant owing to several water intensive processes.
Besides, large quantity of water is used for non-industrial activities  owing to our large workforce.
Water productivity is also one of the  key criteria for selecting any new technology.
Currently, all TML manufacturing sites and  subsidiaries, have achieved Zero Liquid  Discharge status, except TML Jamshedpur  where treated wastewater is partly reused.
The Jaguar Land Rover operations, too, are  focused on reducing water use per vehicle.
Since 2007, the Company has reduced   water use per vehicle by 39%, through   the 'water switch-off' initiative between   vehicles on the production line.
Maximising the use of  treated effluent through  filtration, Ultra Filtration,  Reverse Osmosis  Use of low-flow faucets  to reduce water  consumption To reduce our fresh water  intake, we have taken up  rainwater harvesting   across all our   manufacturing   plants Some of our key conservation initiatives comprise: We have achieved a significant  reduction in surface water  withdrawal due to rainwater  harvesting and storage.
Specific water consumption per vehicle   produced (m3/vehicle) Year 2014-15 11.76 2015-16 10.01 2016-17 11.31 Variable frequency drive  for optimisation of pump  operation  WATER CONSERVATION 52 CORPORATE OVERVIEW With a flurry of in-house manufacturing activities such as pressing /  stamping, fabrication, painting, machining, assembly and testing of  aggregates to final assembly of vehicles, the waste-burden generated  is huge.
However, we are committed to diverting hazardous wastes  away from destructive disposal practices and hence we are exploring  multiple recycling options.
Some initiatives comprise energy recovery from high calorific  value wastes through co-processing route with cement industries,  solidification / stabilisation of ETP sludge as pavers and conversion of  paint sludge into industrial primer.
Although our Indian manufacturing facilities are   not located within the vicinity of any identified or  notified bio-diversity hotspots or protected water   bodies, the extended positive impacts of our water   conservation efforts are evident with   the variety of avian fauna seen at our   water harvesting ponds.
Progressing with 'Zero Waste' target  by 2020, Jaguar Land Rover has set the  interim target of zero waste to landfill  from its manufacturing and product  creation sites.
Some of the key milestones  for achieving the target include: • No waste sent direct to landfill from vehicle  operations  • 95% avoidance of landfill at second tier The Company decided against sending the  waste to off-site facilities for processing,  which may already have an ongoing  contribution to landfill.
During 2016-17, TML has taken  multiple initiatives towards our journey  to achieve 'Zero waste to common  waste disposal site' and have reduced  hazardous waste disposal to landfill and  incineration.
We significantly increased  hazardous waste co-processing for energy  recovery and material recovery at our various  manufacturing sites as well as material  recovery through recycling.
WASTE MANAGEMENT BIODIVERSITY  53 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 In line with the Tata Group Policy on Climate Change,   Tata Motors has articulated its Climate Change Policy, which  articulates a three-pronged approach to our carbon   emissions mitigation strategy:  JLR achieved a 32% reduction in its   European fleet’s average tailpipe CO2  emissions in just eight years.
In the same  period, it has driven a 38% improvement  in its operational CO2 emissions.
Through a  combination of low-emission technologies  and electrification, JLR’s target is to reduce  its European fleet’s average tailpipe CO2  emissions by a further 25% by 2020.
Through REALCAR (Recycled Aluminium  Car) project, in one year alone, JLR reclaimed  and recycled 50,000+ tonnes of aluminium  waste, feeding it back into its manufacturing  process; and preventing the associated CO2  from being released into the atmosphere.
SETTING NEW BENCHMARKS JLR continues to set new benchmarks for the sector.
Targeting emissions reduction,   both for the manufacturing process and during the vehicles’ operations, JLR has   undertaken multiple initiatives:  Product  Development   Minimising tail-pipe  emissions, creating  products dependent  on alternative  energy sources Manufacturing  Process  Improving energy  efficiency and  maximising use  of renewable  energy sources,  thereby minimising  emissions Supply   Chain  Minimising  emissions with   the life-cycle  approach 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Energy Consumption in GJ within TML 961,203 1,002,630 1,052,171 DirectIndirect 1,463,371 1,540,706 1,667,912 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission (tCO2e) 336,494 Scope 1 Scope 2 323,833 317,836 61,604 64,418 68,042 • UK manufacturing facilities, product  creation sites and most of the satellite sites  purchase 100% renewable electricity  from electricity providers.
• Installing solar panels, LED lighting,  combined heat and power, building  management systems, voltage  optimisation, insulation and energy  mapping are all initiatives taken to   ensure carbon neutrality by 2020.
• With an investment of GBP 23 million,  the Company has implemented over 60  energy-saving projects over past few years,  which has led to the savings of 57,000  tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
With this  accomplishment, JLR's specific emissions  per vehicle has reduced by almost 38%,  compared to what it was a decade ago.
TML is the second Indian company  which is committed to RE100, a global  collaborative initiative of the world’s  most influential companies aspiring to  source 100% renewable power.
Currently, TML has obtained around 9%  of electricity from renewables and has its  own captive wind power project of 21.95  MW capacity.
There are numerous energy conservation initiatives undertaken by TML   at its manufacturing facilities.
Some of these include: • Using infrared sensors and  timers for on-off control of  industrial equipment like fans/  pumps/ motors, among others.
• Installing Waste Heat Recovery  System to recover waste heat  from exhaust flue gases.
• Installing LED lighting in all  offices and other common  areas.
• Installing variable   frequency drives.

Activity rebounded strongly in the United  States in second half of calendar 2016 compared to weaker first half.
However, output remained below potential in a number of other  advanced economies, notable in the European area.
The picture of  emerging market and developing economies remained much more  diverse.
The growth rate in China was a bit stronger than expected,  supported by continued policy stimulus.
Activity was weaker than  expected in some Latin American countries such as Brazil, whereas,  activity in Russia was slightly better than expected, in part reflecting  firmer oil prices.
India’s economy has grown at a strong pace in recent years owing to  the implementation of critical structural reforms and lower external  vulnerabilities.
It has grown by 7.1% in Fiscal 2017, compared to  7.9% in Fiscal 2016 primarily because of the temporary consumption  shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions from  demonetisation.
Private investment continues to remain weak due  to over capacity.
In order to propel the economy the government has  been trying to give a thrust to the investment by allocating a higher  sum towards  gross fixed capital formation.
The Tata Motors Group registered a de-growth of 1.1% in income  from operations to `2,74,492 crores in Fiscal 2017 as compared to  `2,77,661 crores in Fiscal 2016, due to negative translation impact  from Great British Pound (GB£) to Indian Rupee (`) of `27,686 crores  and de-growth in the M&HCV segment in India was offset by higher  wholesale volumes in Jaguar and Land Rover and growth in Passenger  Vehicle segment in India.

Tata Motors Limited recorded income from operations (including  joint operations) of `49,100 crores, 3.6% higher from `47,384  crores in the previous year.
Muted demand of M&HCV and LCV  due to weak replacement demand, subdued freight demand from  industrial segment, which took a further hit post demonetization  and lower than expected pre-buying ahead of the implementation  of BS-IV, resulting in lower EBITDA margins of 3.5% in Fiscal 2017 as  against 7.1% in Fiscal 2016.
Loss Before and After Tax (including joint  operations) for Fiscal 2017 were at `2,421 crores and ` 2,480 crores,  respectively, as compared to Loss Before and After Tax (including joint  operations) of `67 crores and `62 crores, respectively in Fiscal 2016.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) (as per IFRS) recorded revenues of GB£24.3  billion compared to GB£22.3 billion in Fiscal 2016, driven by higher  sales volumes and weaker GB£.
Consolidated EBITDA for Fiscal 2017 at GB£3.0 billion, was marginally  lower as compared to EBITDA of GB£3.1 billion for Fiscal 2016, as  the higher revenue was more than offset by higher marketing,  manufacturing and other operating expenses.
EBIT was GB£1.5  billion in Fiscal 2017 lower than GB£1.8 billion in Fiscal 2016, due to   higher depreciation and amortization which were partially offset by  higher profits from the Chinese joint venture.
PBT in Fiscal 2017 was GB£1.6 billion in-line with the PBT of GB£1.6  billion in Fiscal 2016, the lower EBIT and unfavourable foreign  exchange revaluation was more than offset by a favourable  revaluation of commodity hedges and of GB£151 million further  recoveries relating too to Tianjin fire in this year compared to GB£157  million net charge than in Fiscal 2016.
In May 2016, JLR redeemed the remaining US$84 million (GB£57  million equivalent) of the 8.125% US$ bond maturing in 2021 by  exercising its call option, the majority of which was successfully  tendered and redeemed in March 2015.
In January 2017, JLR issued  a €650 million 7-year bond with a coupon of 2.20% and a GB£300  million 4-year bond with a coupon of 2.75%.

India was one of the faster growing  large economies in the world, with a currency that performed better  than most other emerging markets.
There was a significant upturn  in commodity prices after a year of deflation.
Consumer spending  remained subdued during the early part of the year impacted by  two years of drought.
This year was marked by the way for the long  awaited and transformational Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Fiscal 2017 was an eventful year for automobile sector due to: i) Ban  on diesel cars, ii) Demonetization, iii) Ban on sale and registration of  BSIII vehicles.
The demonetization affected the Indian economy, which  resulted in decline in sale of passenger and commercial vehicles by  2.3% in December 2016.
Further, ban on sale and registration of  BSIII vehicles has resulted in higher discounts by the automobile  companies at the end of Fiscal 2017 and inventories to be either  converted into BSIV vehicles or scrapped, affecting the profits.
As per the advance estimates, in Fiscal 2017, India’s GDP increased  by 7.1%, as compared to an increase of 7.9% in Fiscal 2016 (based on  second advanced estimate data from the Ministry of Statistics and  Programme Implementation).
Agriculture sector registered a 4.4%  growth in Fiscal 2017 as compared to 0.8% in Fiscal 2016.
According  to the new base year (2011-12), the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)  recorded 5.0% growth in Fiscal 2017, as compared to 3.4% in Fiscal  2016.
Significant factors influencing IIP growth in Fiscal 2017 included  a 4.9% increase in the manufacturing sector, compared to 3.0% in  Fiscal 2016, which was due to a better performance of sectors like  motor vehicles, other transport equipment and pharmaceuticals.
The  IIP of the mining & quarrying sector increased by 5.3%, compared  to 4.3% in Fiscal 2016, and electricity services recorded moderate  increase of 5.8% in Fiscal 2017, as compared to 5.7% in Fiscal 2016.

Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 119 Risk Factors Risks associated with the Company’s Business and the  Automotive Industry.
Deterioration in global economic conditions could have a  material adverse impact on the Company’s sales and results of  operations.
The Indian automotive industry could be affected materially by  the general economic conditions in India and around the world.
The automotive industry, in general, is cyclical, and economic  slowdowns in the recent past have affected the manufacturing  sector in India, including the automotive and related industries.
A  continuation of negative economic trends or further deterioration  in key economic metrics, such as the growth rate, interest rates and  inflation, as well as reduced availability of financing for vehicles at  competitive rates, environment policies, tax policies, increase in  freight rates and fuel prices could materially and adversely affect  the Company’s automotive sales in India and results of operations.
In addition, investors’ reactions to economic developments or a loss  of investor confidence in the financial systems of other countries  may cause volatility in Indian financial markets and indirectly, in  the Indian economy in general.
Any worldwide financial instability,  including withdrawal from trade pacts by countries in which the  Company operates, could also have a negative impact on the Indian  economy, including the movement of exchange rates and interest  rates in India.
In the event global economic recovery is slower  than expected, or if there is any significant financial disruption,  this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s cost  of funding, portfolio of financing loans, business, prospects, results  of operations, financial condition and the trading price of the  Company’s Shares and ADSs.
The Company’s Jaguar Land Rover business has significant  operations in the United Kingdom, North America, continental  Europe and China as well as sales operations in other overseas  markets across the globe.
The automotive market in China  experienced strong growth in Fiscal 2017, with positive growth also  in Europe, the UK and the US.
Conditions remained challenging in  emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa where  automotive sales deteriorated during Fiscal 2017.
Jaguar Land  Rovers’ growth plans may not quite materialize as expected which  could have a significant adverse impact on company’s financial  performance.
If automotive demand softens because of lower or  negative economic growth in key markets (notably China) or due to  other factors, Jaguar Land Rover’s operations and financial condition  could be materially and adversely affected as a result.
The Brexit vote, the June 8, 2017 U.K.-election results and the  ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the  European Union to finalize terms of the United Kingdom’s exit  from the European Union has created significant uncertainty  with respect to the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the  European Union, the economic and political future of the United  Kingdom and the legal structure applicable to companies doing  business in the United Kingdom.
This uncertainty, along with any  real or perceived impact of Brexit, could have a material adverse  effect on the Company’s Jaguar Land Rover business, results of  operations and financial condition.
Deterioration in key economic  factors, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates and inflation, as well  as the reduced availability of financing for vehicles at competitive  rates in countries where Jaguar Land Rover has sales operations  may result in a decrease in demand for automobiles.
A decrease in  demand would, in turn, cause automobile prices and manufacturing  capacity utilization rates to fall.
Such circumstances have in the past  materially affected, and could in the future, materially affect, the  Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Intensifying competition could materially and adversely  affect the Company’s sales, financial conditions and results of  operations.
The global automotive industry is highly competitive and  competition is likely to further intensify in light of continuing  globalization and consolidation.
Competition is especially likely to  increase in the premium automotive categories as each market  participant intensifies its efforts to retain its position in established  markets while also expanding in emerging markets, such as China,  India, Russia, Brazil and parts of Asia.
Factors affecting competition  include product quality and features, innovation and the  development time for introduction of new products, cost control,  pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, environmental impact  and perception thereof, customer service and financing terms.
In  light of the impending Brexit, some of the Company’s EU-based  competitors may gain a competitive advantage that would enable  them to benefit from their access to the European Union single  market post-Brexit.
There can be no assurance that the Company  will be able to compete successfully in the global automotive  industry in the future.
The Company also faces strong competition in the Indian market  from domestic, as well as foreign automobile manufacturers.
Improving infrastructure and growth prospects, compared to those  of other mature markets, has attracted a number of international  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 120 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 companies to India either through joint arrangements with local  partners or through independently owned operations in India.
International competitors bring with them decades of international  experience, global scale, advanced technology and significant  financial resources.
Consequently, domestic competition is likely to  further intensify in the future.
There can be no assurance that the  Company will be able to implement the Company’s future strategies  in a way that will mitigate the effects of increased competition on  the Indian automotive industry.
Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive  and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery,  research and development, product design, engineering, technology  and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and  regulatory requirements.
If competitors consolidate or enter into  other strategic agreements such as alliances, they may be able to  take better advantage of economies of scale.
The Company believes  that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings  offered by consolidation or alliances, which could adversely affect  the Company’s competitiveness with respect to those competitors.
Competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of  enhancing their competitiveness (including through the acquisition  of technology), which could also materially adversely affect  Company’s business.
Further the Company’s growth strategy relies on  the expansion of the Company’s operations in less mature markets  abroad, where the Company may face significant competition and  higher than expected costs to enter and establish themselves.
If the Company is unable to effectively implement or manage  the Company’s strategy, it’s operating results and financial  condition could be materially and adversely affected.
As part of its strategy, the Company may open new manufacturing,  research or engineering facilities, expand existing facilities, add  additional product lines or expand its businesses into new  geographical markets.
There is a range of risks inherent in such  a strategy that could adversely affect its ability to achieve these  objectives, including, but not limited to, the potential disruption  of the Company’s business; the uncertainty that new product lines  will generate anticipated sales; the uncertainty that a new business  will achieve anticipated operating results; the diversion of resources  and management’s time; the cost reduction efforts, which may not  be successful; the difficulty of managing the operations of a larger  Company; and the difficulty of competing for growth opportunities  with companies having greater financial resources than the  Company has.
More specifically, the international businesses of the Company  face a range of risks and challenges, including, but not limited to,  the following: language barriers, cultural differences, difficulties in  staffing and managing overseas operations, inherent difficulties and  delays in contract enforcement and the collection of receivables  under the legal systems of foreign countries, the risk of non-tariff   barriers, regulatory and legal requirements affecting the Company’s  ability to enter new markets through joint ventures with local entities,  difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals, environmental permits  and other similar types of governmental consents, difficulties in  negotiating effective contracts, obtaining the necessary facility sites  or marketing outlets or securing essential local financing, liquidity,  trade financing or cash management facilities, export and import  restrictions, multiple tax regimes (including regulations relating to  transfer pricing and withholding and other taxes on remittances and  other payments from subsidiaries), foreign investment restrictions,  foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds,  other restrictions on foreign trade or investment sanctions, and  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and  regulations.
Furthermore, as part of global activities, the Company  may engage with third-party dealers and distributors, which the  Company do not control but which, nevertheless, take actions that  could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s reputation  and business; the Company cannot assure you that it will not be  held responsible for any activities undertaken by such dealers and  distributors.
If the Company is unable to manage risks related to  its expansion and growth in other parts of the world and therefore  fail to establish a strong presence in those higher growth markets,  its business, results of operations and financial condition could be  adversely affected or its investments could be lost.
Furthermore, the Company is subject to risks associated with  growing its business through mergers and acquisitions.
The  Company believes that its acquisitions provide it opportunities to  grow significantly in the global automobile markets by offering  premium brands and products.
The Company’s acquisitions have  provided it with access to technology and additional capabilities  while also offering potential synergies.
However, the scale, scope and  nature of the integration required in connection with its acquisitions  present significant challenges, and the Company may be unable to  integrate the relevant subsidiaries, divisions and facilities effectively  within its expected schedule.
An acquisition may not meet its  expectations and the realization of the anticipated benefits may be  blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of numerous factors, some  of which are outside the Company’s control.
Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 121 For example, the Company acquired the Jaguar Land Rover  business from Ford in June 2008, and since then Jaguar Land  Rover has become a significant part of its business, accounting for  approximately 79% of its total revenues in Fiscal 2017.
As a result  of the acquisition, the Company is responsible for, among other  things, the obligations and liabilities associated with the legacy  business of Jaguar Land Rover.
There can be no assurances that  any legacy issues at Jaguar Land Rover or any other acquisition the  Company has undertaken in the past or will undertake in the future  would not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial  condition and results of operations, as well as its reputation and  prospects.
The Company will continue to evaluate growth opportunities  through suitable mergers and acquisitions in the future.
Growth  through mergers and acquisitions involves business risks, including  unforeseen contingent risks or latent business liabilities that may only  become apparent after the merger or acquisition is completed.
The  key success factors are seamless integration, effective management  of the merged and/or acquired entity, retention of key personnel,  cash flow generation from synergies in engineering and sourcing,  joint sales and marketing efforts, and management of a larger  business.
If any of these factors fails to materialize or if the Company  is unable to manage any of the associated risks successfully, the  business, financial condition and results of operations could be  materially and adversely affected.
The Company’s future success depends on its ability to  satisfy changing customer demands by offering innovative  products in a timely manner and maintaining such products’  competitiveness and quality.
The Company’s competitors may gain significant advantages if they  are able to offer products satisfying customer needs earlier than the  Company is able to, which could adversely impact the Company’s  sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Unanticipated  delays or cost overruns in implementing new product launches,  expansion plans or capacity enhancements could also materially  and adversely impact the Company’s financial condition and results  of operations.
Climate change concerns and the promotion of new technologies,  such as autopilot, encourage customers to look beyond standard  factors (such as price, design, performance, brand image or comfort  and features) in favor of more fuel efficient, convenient and  environmentally friendly vehicles.
As a result of the public discourse  on climate change and volatile fuel prices, the Company faces more  stringent government regulations, imposition of speed limits and  higher taxes on sports utility vehicles or premium automobiles.
The  Company endeavours to take account these factors, and is focused  on researching, developing and producing new drive technologies,  such as hybrid engines and electric cars.
The Company also  investing in development programs to reduce fuel consumption  through the use of lightweight materials, reducing parasitic losses  through the driveline and improving aerodynamics.
Coupled with  consumer preferences, a failure to achieve the Company’s planned  objectives or delays in developing fuel efficient products could  materially affect the Company’s ability to sell premium passenger  cars and large or medium-sized all-terrain vehicles at current or  targeted volume levels, and could have a material adverse effect  on the Company’s general business activity, net assets, financial  position and results of operations.
In addition, a deterioration in  the quality of the Company’s vehicles could force the Company  to incur substantial costs and damage its reputation.
There is a  risk that competitors or joint ventures set up by competitors will  develop better solutions and will be able to manufacture the  resulting products more rapidly, in larger quantities, with a higher  quality and/or at a lower cost.
It is possible that the Company  could then be compelled to make new investments in researching  and developing other technologies to maintain its existing market  share or to win back the market share lost to competitors.
Finally,  the Company’s manufacturing operations and sales may be subject  to potential physical impacts of climate change, including changes  in weather patterns and an increased potential for extreme weather  events, which could affect the manufacture and distribution of the  Company’s products and the cost and availability of raw materials  and components.
Private and commercial users of transportation increasingly use  modes of transportation other than the automobile.
The reasons  for this include the rising costs of automotive transport, increasing  traffic density in major cities and environmental awareness.
Furthermore, the increased use of car-sharing concepts and other  innovative mobility initiatives facilitates access to other methods of  transport, thereby reducing dependency on the private automobile.
Furthermore, non-traditional market participants may dependency  on the private automobile altogether.
A shift in consumer  preferences away from private automobiles would have a material  adverse effect on the Company’s general business activity and on  sales, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
To stimulate demand, competitors in the automotive industry have  offered customers and dealers price reductions on vehicles and  services, which has led to increased price pressures and sharpened  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 122 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 competition within the industry.
As a provider of numerous  high-volume models, the Company’s profitability and cash flows  are significantly affected by the risk of rising competitive price  pressures.
Special sales incentives and increased price pressures  in the new car business also influence price levels in the used car  market, with a negative effect on vehicle resale values.
This may  have a negative impact on the profitability of the used car business  in the Company’s dealer organization.
There can be no assurance that the Company’s new models will  meet its sales expectations, in which case the Company may  be unable to realize the intended economic benefits of the  Company’s investments, which would in turn materially affect the  Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, there is a risk that the Company’s quality standards can  be maintained only by incurring substantial costs for monitoring  and quality assurance.
For the Company’s customers, one of the  determining factors in purchasing its vehicles is the high quality of  the products.
A decrease in the quality of the Company’s vehicles (or if the public  were to have the impression that such a decrease in quality had  occurred) could damage the Company’s image and reputation as a  premium automobile manufacturer and in turn materially affect the  Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, product development cycles can be lengthy, and there  is no assurance that new designs will lead to revenues from vehicle  sales, or that the Company will be able to accurately forecast demand  for its vehicles, potentially leading to inefficient use of the Company’s  production capacity.
Additionally, the Company’s high proportion of  fixed costs, due to the Company’s significant investment in property,  plant and equipment, further exacerbates the risks associated with  incorrectly assessing demand for its vehicles.
The Company is subject to risks associated with product  liability warranties and recalls.
The Company is subjected to risks and costs associated with product  liability, warranties and recalls in connection with performance,  compliance or safety-related issues affecting the Company’s  products which may, in turn, cause the Company’s customers to  question the safety or reliability of its vehicles and thus result in a  materially adverse effect on its business, impacting its reputation,  results from operations and financial condition.
Such events could  also require the Company to expend considerable resources to  remediate, and the Company may be subject to class actions, other  large-scale product liability, or other lawsuits in various jurisdictions  where the Company conducts business.
In May 2016, an industry- wide passenger airbag safety recall was announced in the United  States by the National Highway Traffic System Administration or  NHTSA, in respect of airbags from Takata Corporation or Takata,  a supplier of airbags.
Certain front-passenger airbags supplied by  Takata were installed in vehicles sold by Jaguar Land Rover.
The  Company considered the cost associated with the recall to be an  adjusting post-balance sheet event and recognized an additional  provision of GB£ 67.4 million for the estimated cost of repairs in its  income statement for Fiscal 2016.
The Company expects to utilize  such provision over the next one to four years.
Furthermore, the Company may also be subject to class actions  or other large-scale product liability or other lawsuits in various  jurisdictions in which the Company may have a significant presence.
The use of shared components in vehicle production increases this  risk because individual components are deployed in a number of  different models across the Company’s brands.
Any costs incurred  or lost sales caused by product liability, warranties and recalls could  materially adversely affect the Company’s business.
Any disruption in the supply of automobile components could  have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of  operations.
Adverse economic conditions, a decline in automobile demand and  lack of access to sufficient financing arrangements, among others,  could have a negative financial impact on the Company’s suppliers,  thereby impairing timely availability of components to the Company  or causing increase in the costs of components.
In addition, if  one or more of the other global automotive manufacturers were  to become insolvent, this would have an adverse effect on the  Company’s supply chains and may have a material adverse effect  on the Company’s results of operations.
The Company’s Jaguar Land Rover has also entered into supply  agreements with Ford and certain other third parties for critical  components and remain reliant upon Ford and the Ford-PSA joint  venture for a portion of Jaguar Land Rover engines.
However,  following the launch of the EMC in Wolverhampton, Jaguar Land  Rover now also manufactures its own ‘‘in-house’’ engines.
The  Company may not be able to manufacture certain types of engines  or find a suitable replacement supplier in a timely manner in the  event of any disruption in the supply of engines, or parts of engines,  and other hardware or services provided to Jaguar Land Rover by  Ford or the Ford-PSA joint venture and such disruption could have  a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations, business  and/or financial condition.
Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 123 A change in requirements under long-term supply arrangements  committing Jaguar Land Rover to purchase minimum or fixed  quantities of certain parts, or to pay a minimum amount to the  seller, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s  financial condition or results of operations.
The Company have  entered into a number of long-term supply contracts that require  Jaguar Land Rover to purchase a fixed quantity of parts to be used  in the production of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles (e.g., ‘‘take-or-pay’’  contracts).
If the need for any of these parts were to lessen, Jaguar  Land Rover could still be required to purchase a specified quantity  of the part or pay a minimum amount to the seller pursuant to the  take-or-pay contract, which could have a substantial adverse effect  on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Increases in input prices may have a material adverse effect on  the Company’s results of operations.
In Fiscal 2017 and 2016, the consumption of raw materials,  components and aggregates and purchase of products for sale  (including changes in inventory) constituted approximately 60.4%  and 58.8%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues.
Prices of  commodity items used in manufacturing automobiles, including  steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, rubber, platinum, palladium and  rhodium, have become increasingly volatile in recent years.
Further  price movements would closely depend on the evolving economic  scenarios across the globe.
While the Company continues to pursue  cost reduction initiatives, an increase in price of input materials  could severely impact the Company’s profitability to the extent  such increase cannot be absorbed by the market through price  increases and/or could have a negative impact on demand.
In  addition, an increased price and supply risk could arise from the  need for rare and frequently sought-after raw materials for which  demand is high, such as rare earths, which are predominantly found  in China.
Rare earth metal prices and supply remain uncertain.
In  the past, China has limited the export of rare earths from time to  time.
Due to intense price competition and the Company’s high  level of fixed costs, the Company may not be able to adequately  address changes in commodity prices even if they are foreseeable.
Increases in fuel costs also pose a significant challenge, especially in  the commercial and premium vehicle categories where increased  fuel prices have an impact on demand.
If the Company is unable to  find substitutes for supplies of raw materials or pass price increases  on to customers, or to safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials,  the Company’s vehicle production, business, financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
The Company manages these risks through the use of fixed  supply contracts with tenor upto 12 months and the use of  financial derivatives pursuant to a defined hedging policy.
The  Company enters into a variety of foreign currency, interest rates  and commodity forward contracts and options to manage the  Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,  interest rates and commodity price risk.
These financial exposures  are managed in accordance with the Company’s risk management  policies and procedures.
The Company uses foreign currency  forward and option contracts to hedge risks associated with  foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast  transactions.
The Company also enters into interest rate swaps  and interest rate currency swap agreements, mainly to manage  exposure on the Company’s fixed rate or variable rate debt.
The  Company further uses interest rate derivatives or currency swaps  to hedge exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on principal  and interest payments for borrowings denominated in foreign  currencies.
Specific transactional risks include risks like liquidity  and pricing risks, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation risks,  volatility risks, counterparty risks, settlement risks and gearing risks.
However, the hedging transactions may not adequately protect  the Company against these risks.
In addition, if markets move  adversely, the Company may incur financial losses on such hedging  transactions, the financial condition and results of operations may  be adversely impacted.
The significant reliance of the Company and Jaguar Land Rover  on key markets increases the risk of the negative impact of  reduced customer demand in those countries.
The Company and Jaguar Land Rover, relies on the United  Kingdom, Chinese, North American and continental European  markets.
Any decline in demand for the Company’s and Jaguar  Land Rover’s vehicles in these key markets may significantly impact  the Company’s business, growth prospects, financial position and  results of operations.
Further, decreased demand for the Company’s  and Jaguar Land Rover’s products may not be sufficiently mitigated  by new product launches and expansion into growing markets,  which could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s  financial performance.
The Company is exposed to liquidity risks.
The Company’s main sources of liquidity are cash generated from  operations, the existing notes, external debt in the form of factoring  discount facilities and other revolving credit facilities.
However,  adverse changes in the global economic and financial environment  may result in lower consumer demand for vehicles, and prevailing  conditions in credit markets may adversely affect both consumer  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 124 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 demand and the cost and availability of finance for the Company’s  business and operations.
If the global economy goes back into  recession and consumer demand for the Company’s vehicles drops,  as a result of higher oil prices, excessive public debt or for any other  reasons, and the supply of external financing becomes limited, the  Company may again face significant liquidity risks.
The Company is also subject to various types of restrictions or  impediments on the ability of companies in its Group in certain  countries to transfer cash across the Group through loans or  interim dividends.
These restrictions or impediments are caused  by exchange controls, withholding taxes on dividends and  distributions and other similar restrictions in the markets in which  the Company operates.
The cash in some of these jurisdictions is  subject to certain restrictions on cash pooling, intercompany loan  arrangements or interim dividends.
Exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations could materially  and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and  results of operations.
The Company’s operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates with reference to countries in which  it operates.
The Company imports capital equipment, raw materials  and components from, manufacture vehicles in, and sell vehicles  into, various countries, and therefore, its revenues and costs have  significant exposure to the relative movements of the GB£, the  U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Chinese Renminbi, the  Singapore dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Australian dollar, the South  African rand, the Thai baht, the Korean won and the Indian rupee.
The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could also  have a negative impact on the growth of the UK economy and  cause greater volatility in the pound sterling.
This could directly  impact the Company’s sales volumes and financial results, as the  Company derives the majority of its revenues from overseas markets  and source significant levels of raw materials and components from  Europe, which may result in decrease in profits to the extent of non-  British pound costs, are not fully mitigated by non-British pound  sales.
Moreover, the Company has an outstanding foreign currency  denominated debt and is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rates.
The Company has experienced and could expect  in the future to experience foreign exchange losses on obligations  denominated in foreign currencies in respect of its borrowings and  foreign currency assets and liabilities due to currency fluctuations.
The Company has both interest-bearing assets (including cash  balances) and interest-bearing liabilities, which bear interest at  variable rates.
The Company is therefore exposed to changes in  interest rates.
Although the Company engages in managing its  interest and foreign exchange exposure through use of financial  hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, swap agreements  and option contracts, higher interest rates and a weakening of the  Indian rupee against major foreign currencies could significantly  increase its cost of borrowing, which could have a material adverse  effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations  and liquidity.
The Company is exposed to the risk that appropriate hedging  lines for the type of risk exposures it is subjected to may not be  available at a reasonable cost, particularly during volatile rate  movements, or at all.
Moreover, there are risks associated with the  use of such hedging instruments.
Whilst mitigating to some degree  the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange  rates, the Company potentially forgo benefits that might result  from market fluctuations in currency exposures.
These hedging  transactions can also result in substantial losses.
Such losses could  occur under various circumstances, including, without limitation,  any circumstances in which a counterparty does not perform its  obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement (despite  having ISDA agreements in place with each of the Company’s  hedging counterparties), currency fluctuations, the arrangement is  imperfect or ineffective, or the Company’s internal hedging policies  and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned.
In  addition, because the Company’s potential obligations under the  financial hedging instruments are marked to market, the Company  may experience quarterly and annual volatility in its operating  results and cash flows attributable to its financial hedging activities.
A decline in retail customers’ purchasing power or consumer  confidence or in corporate customers’ financial condition and  willingness to invest could materially and adversely affect the  Company’s business.
Demand for vehicles for personal use generally depends on  consumers’ net purchasing power, their confidence in future  economic developments and changes in fashion and trends, while  demand for vehicles for commercial use by corporate customers  (including fleet customers) primarily depends on the customers’  financial condition, their willingness to invest (motivated by  expected future business prospects) and available financing.
A decrease in potential customers’ disposable income or their  financial flexibility or an increase in the cost of financing will  generally have a negative impact on demand for the Company’s  Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 125 products.
A weak macroeconomic environment, combined with  restrictive lending and a low level of consumer sentiment generally,  may reduce consumers’ net purchasing power and lead existing  and potential customers to refrain from purchasing a new vehicle,  to defer a purchase further or to purchase a smaller model with  less equipment at a lower price.
A deteriorating macroeconomic  environment may disproportionately reduce demand for luxury  vehicles.
It also leads to reluctance by corporate customers to invest  in vehicles for commercial use and/or to lease vehicles, resulting in  a postponement of fleet renewal contracts.
The Company is subject to risks associated with the automobile  financing business.
The sale of Company’s commercial and passenger vehicles is  heavily dependent on funding availability for its customers.
Rising  delinquencies and early defaults have contributed to a reduction  in automobile financing, which, in turn, has had an adverse effect  on funding availability for potential customers.
This reduction in  available financing may continue in the future and have a material  adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and  results of operations.
In India, the Company is subjected to risks associated with its  automobile financing business.
Any default by its customers  or inability to repay installments as due could materially and  adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results  of operations and cash flows.
In addition, any downgrade in the  Company’s credit ratings may increase its borrowing costs and  restrict its access to the debt markets.
Over time, and particularly in  the event of any credit rating downgrade, market volatility, market  disruption, regulatory changes or otherwise, the Company may  need to reduce the amount of financing receivables it originates,  which could severely disrupt its ability to support the sale of its  vehicles.
Jaguar Land Rover has consumer financing arrangements in place  with financing partners in a number of key markets.
Any reduction  in the supply of available consumer financing for the purchase  of new vehicles could make it more difficult for some customers  to purchase vehicles, which could put Jaguar Land Rover under  commercial pressure to offer new (or expand existing) retail or  dealer incentives to maintain demand for their vehicles, thereby  materially and adversely affecting Jaguar Land Rover sales and  results of operations.
Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rover also offers  residual value guarantees on the leases of certain vehicles in certain  markets.
The value of these guarantees is dependent on used car  valuations in those markets at the end of the lease, which is subject  to change.
Consequently, Jaguar Land Rover may be adversely  affected by movements in used car valuations in these markets.
Underperformance of the Company’s distribution channels  and supply chains may have a material adverse effect on the  Company’s sales, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company relies on third parties to supply it with the raw  materials, parts and components used in the manufacture of the  Company’s products.
For some of these parts and components, the  Company is dependent on a single source.
The Company’s ability  to procure supplies in a cost-effective and timely manner is subject  to various factors, some of which are not within the Company’s  control.
While the Company manages its supply chain as part of  its vendor management process, any significant problems with the  Company’s supply chain in the future could disrupt its business and  materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations,  as well as its sales, net income and financial condition.
The Company’s products are sold and serviced through a network  of authorized dealers and service centers across India and through  a network of distributors and local dealers in international markets.
The Company monitors the performance of its dealers and  distributors and provide them with support to enable them to  perform to its expectations.
There can be no assurance, however,  that the Company expectations will be met.
Any underperformance  by the Company’s dealers or distributors could materially and  adversely affect the Company’s sales and results of operations.
If dealers or importers encounter financial difficulties and the  Company’s products and services cannot be sold or sold only in  limited numbers, this would have a direct effect on the sales of such  dealers and importers.
Additionally, if the Company cannot replace  the affected dealers or importers with other franchises, the financial  difficulties experienced by such dealers or importers could have an  indirect effect on the Company’s vehicle deliveries.
Consequently, the Company could be compelled to provide  additional support for dealers and importers and, under certain  circumstances, may even take over their obligations to customers,  which would adversely affect the Company’s financial position and  results of operations in the short term.
Deterioration in the performance of any of the subsidiaries,  joint ventures and affiliates may adversely the Company’s  results of operations.
The Company has made and may continue to make capital  commitments to its subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates, and if  the business or operations of any of these subsidiaries, joint ventures  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 126 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 and affiliates deteriorate, the value of the Company’s investments  may decline substantially.
Operating a business as a joint venture  often requires additional organizational formalities and requirement  of information sharing.
The Company is also subjected to risks  associated with joint ventures and affiliates wherein the Company  retains only partial or joint control.
The Company’s partners may be  unable, or unwilling, to fulfill their obligations, or the strategies of  its joint ventures or affiliates may not be implemented successfully,  any of which may significantly reduce the value of its investments  or relationship with the co-owner may be deteriorated, and, which  may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s  reputation, business, financial position or results of operations.
The Company may be adversely impacted by political  instability, wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts, countries  resorting to protectionism natural disasters, fuel shortages/ prices, epidemics, labour strikes and other risks in the markets  in which the Company operates.
The Company’s products are exported to a number of geographical  markets and the Company plans to expand its international  operations further in the future.
Consequently, the Company is  subjected to various risks associated with conducting its business  both within and outside its domestic market and the Company’s  operations may be subject to political instability, wars, terrorism,  regional and/or multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel  shortages/prices, epidemics and labour strikes.
Any disruption of the  operations of the Company’s manufacturing, design, engineering,  sales, corporate and other facilities could materially and adversely  affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results  of operations.
In addition, conducting business internationally,  especially in emerging markets, exposes the Company to additional  risks, including adverse changes in economic and government  policies, unpredictable shifts in regulation, inconsistent application  of existing laws and applicability of retrospective taxes/sanction,  programs unclear regulatory and taxation systems and divergent  commercial and employment practices and procedures.
Any  significant or prolonged disruptions or delays in the Company’s  operations related to these risks could adversely impact its results  of operations.
Terrorist attacks, civil disturbances, regional conflicts and other acts  of violence, particularly in India, may disrupt or otherwise adversely  affect the markets in which the Company operates and the  business and profitability of the Company.
India has from time to  time experienced social and civil unrest and hostilities and adverse  social, economic or political events, including terrorist attacks and  local civil disturbances, riots and armed conflict with neighboring  countries.
Events of this nature in the future could influence the  Indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on the  Company’s business, as well as the market for securities of Indian  companies, including the Company’s Shares and ADSs.
Such  incidents could also create a greater perception that investment in  Indian companies involves a higher degree of risk and could have  a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of  operations and financial condition, and also the market price of the  Company’s Shares and ADSs.
The Company is vulnerable to supply chain disruptions resulting  from natural disasters or man-made accidents.
For example, on  August 12, 2015, there was an explosion in the city port of Tianjin,  one of three major ports in China through which the Company’s  Jaguar Land Rover imports its vehicles.
Approximately 5,800 of  Jaguar Land Rover vehicles were stored at various locations in  Tianjin at the time of the explosion, and, as a result, Jaguar Land  Rover recognized an exceptional charge of GBP245 million in the  three months ended September 30, 2015.
Subsequently, GBP 274  million of net insurance proceeds and other recoveries have been  received till March 31, 2017 , including £35 million related to other  costs associated with Tianjin including lost and discounted vehicle  revenue.
A significant delay or sustained interruption in the supply  of key inputs sourced from areas affected by disasters or accidents  could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to  maintain the Company’s current and expected levels of production,  and therefore negatively affect the Company’s revenues and  increase the operating expenses.
The Company is a global organization, and is therefore vulnerable  to shifts in global trade and economic policies and outlook.
Policies  that result in countries withdrawing from trade pacts, increasing  protectionism and undermining free trade could substantially affect  the Company’s ability to operate as a global business.
Additionally,  negative sentiments towards foreign companies among the  Company’s overseas customers and employees could adversely  affect our sales as well as the Company’s ability to hire and retain  talented people.
A negative shift in either policies or sentiment with  respect to global trade and foreign businesses could have a material  adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and  financial condition.
The Company’s business is seasonal in nature and a substantial  decrease in the Company’s sales during certain quarters could  have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial  performance.
The sales volumes and prices for the Company’s vehicles are  influenced by the cyclicality and seasonality of demand for these  Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 127 products.
The automotive industry has been cyclical in the past and  the Company expects this cyclicality to continue.
In the Indian market, demand for the Company’s vehicles generally  peaks between January and March, although there is a decrease in  demand in February just before release of the Indian fiscal budget.
Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up again in  the festival season from September onwards, with a decline in  December due to year-end as customers defer purchases to the  New Year.
The Jaguar Land Rover business is impacted by the semi-annual  registration of vehicles in the United Kingdom where the vehicle  registration number changes every March and September, which,  leads to an increase in sales during these months and in turn, has an  impact on the resale value of vehicles.
Most other markets, such as  the United States, are influenced by the introduction of new-model- year products, which typically occurs in the autumn of each year.
Furthermore, in the United States there is some seasonality in the  purchasing patterns of vehicles in northern states, notably for Jaguar  when vehicle sales are concentrated in the spring and summer  months and for Land Rover where the trend for purchasing 4x4  vehicles is concentrated in the autumn and winter months.
Markets  in China tend to experience higher demand for vehicles around the  Chinese New Year and other national holidays.
In addition, demand  in western European automotive markets tends to be softer during  the summer and winter holidays.
Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rover’s  cash flows are impacted by the temporary shutdown of four of their  manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom (including the Engine  Manufacturing Centre at Wolverhampton) during the summer and  winter holidays.
As a result, the profile of operating results differs  between each reporting period.
Restrictive covenants in financing agreements may limit the  Company operations and financial flexibility and materially  and adversely impact the Company’s financial condition,  results of operations and prospects.
Some of the Company’s financing agreements and debt  arrangements set limits on and/or require it to obtain lender consent  before, among other things, pledging assets as security.
In addition,  certain financial covenants may limit the Company’s ability to  borrow additional funds or to incur additional liens.
In the past, the  Company has been able to obtain required lender consent for such  activities.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company  will be able to obtain such consents in the future.
If the Company’s  liquidity needs or growth plans require such consents and such  consents are not obtained, the Company may be forced to forego  or alter the Company’s plans, which could materially and adversely  affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
In the event the Company breach these covenants, the outstanding  amounts due under such financing agreements could become  due and payable immediately and/or result in increased costs.
A  default under one of these financing agreements may also result  in cross-defaults under other financing agreements and result in  the outstanding amounts under such other financing agreements  becoming due and payable immediately.
Defaults under one or  more of the Company’s financing agreements could have a material  adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of  operations.
The Company relies on licensing arrangements with Tata  Sons Limited to use the “Tata” brand.
Any improper use of  the associated trademarks by the Company’s licensor or any  other third parties could materially and adversely affect  the Company’s business, financial condition and results of  operations.
The Company’s rights to the Company’s trade names and  trademarks are a crucial factor in marketing the Company’s products.
Establishment of the “Tata” word mark and logo mark in and outside  India is material to the Company’s operations.
The Company has  licensed the use of the “Tata” brand from its Promoter, Tata Sons  Limited, or Tata Sons.
If Tata Sons, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated  entities, or any third party uses the trade name “Tata” in ways that  adversely affect such trade name or trademark, its reputation could  suffer damage, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect  on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Inability to protect or preserve the Company’s intellectual  property could materially and adversely affect the Company’s  business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company owns or otherwise have rights in respect of a number  of patents relating to the products it manufactures.
In connection  with the design and engineering of new vehicles and the  enhancement of existing models, the Company seeks to regularly  develop new intellectual property.
The Company also uses technical  designs, which are the intellectual property of third parties with such  third parties’ consent.
These patents and trademarks have been of  value in the growth of the Company’s business and may continue  to be of value in the future.
Although the Company does not regard  any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent  or related group of patents, an inability to protect this intellectual  property generally, or the illegal breach of some or a large group of  the Company’s intellectual property rights, would have a materially  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 128 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of  operations.
The Company may also be affected by restrictions on  the use of intellectual property rights held by third parties and the  Company may be held legally liable for the infringement of the  intellectual property rights of others in its products.
Impairment of intangible assets may have a material adverse  effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive  and requires substantial investments in intangible assets such  as research and development, product design and engineering  technology.
The Company reviews the value of its intangible  assets to assess on an annual basis whether the carrying amount  matches the recoverable amount for the asset concerned based  on underlying cash-generating units.
The Company may have to  take an impairment loss as at a current balance sheet date or future  balance sheet date, if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable  amount, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial  condition and the results of operations.
The Company may be adversely affected by labour unrest.
All of the Company’s permanent employees in India, other than  officers and managers, and most of its permanent employees in  South Korea and the United Kingdom, including certain officers  and managers, in relation to its automotive business, are members  of labour unions and are covered by its wage agreements, where  applicable, with those labour unions.
In general, the Company considers its labour relations with all of its  employees to be good.
However, in the future the Company may be  subject to labour unrest, which may delay or disrupt its operations in  the affected regions, including the acquisition of raw materials and  parts, the manufacture, sales and distribution of products and the  provision of services.
If work stoppages or lockouts at the Company’s  facilities or at the facilities of the Company’s major vendors occur  or continue for a long period of time, the Company’s business,  financial condition and results of operations may be materially  and adversely affected.
The Company did recently face two minor  standalone incidents of labour unrest, one in the Dharwad plant in  Karnataka, India and the other in the Company’s Sanand plant in  Gujarat, India, both of which were amicably resolved.
The Company’s business and prospects could suffer if the  Company loses one or more key personnel or if the Company is  unable to attract and retain the Company’s employees.
The Company’s business and future growth depend largely on  the skills of its workforce, including executives and officers, and  automotive designers and engineers.
The loss of the services of one  or more of the Company’s personnel could impair the Company’s  ability to implement its business strategy.
In view of intense  competition, any inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate  the Company’s workforce could materially and adversely affect the  Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and  prospects.
Future pension obligations may prove costlier than currently  anticipated and the market value of assets in the Company’s  pension plans could decline.
The Company provides post-retirement and pension benefits to  the Company’s employees, including defined benefit plans.
The  Company’s pension liabilities are generally funded.
However, lower  returns on pension fund assets, changes in market conditions,  interest rates or inflation rates, and adverse changes in other critical  actuarial assumptions, may impact the Company’s pension liabilities  or assets and consequently increase funding requirements, which  could materially decrease the Company’s net income and cash flows.
For Jaguar Land Rover, the arrangements with the trustees of the  defined benefit pension schemes, an actuarial valuation of the  assets and liabilities of the schemes is undertaken every three years.
The most recent valuation, as at April 2015 and completed in 2016,  indicated a shortfall in the assets of the schemes as at that date,  versus the actuarially determined liabilities as at that date, of GB£  789 million (compared to GB£ 702 million as at April 2012).
As part of the valuation process, the Company agreed to a schedule  of contributions with the trustee of the schemes, which, together  with the expected investment performance of the assets of the  schemes, is expected to eliminate the deficit by 2025.
As part of this  schedule of contributions, the Company paid GB£ 69 million into  the pension schemes in March 2016 as advance payments towards  deficit contributions due during Fiscal 2017.
As at March 31, 2017,  the UK defined benefit pension accounted deficit had increased  to GB£ 1.46 billion, as compared to GB£ 567 million as at March  31, 2016.
This increase has primarily been driven by a decline in  AA-negative rated UK corporate bond yields following Brexit and  even though the accounted deficit position does not affect cash  contributions, movements in the associated balance sheet liability  may have other impacts notably on the Company’s results of  operations and financial condition.
The Company is exposed to operational risks, including risks in  connection with the Company’s use of information technology.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 129 internal systems and processes, from either internal or external   events.
Such risks could stem from inadequacy or failures of  controls within internal procedures, violations of internal policies by  employees, disruptions or malfunctioning of information technology  systems, such as computer networks and telecommunication  systems, other mechanical or equipment failures, human error,  natural disasters or malicious acts by third parties.
Any unauthorized  access to or misuse of data on the Company’s information   technology systems, human errors or technological or process  failures of any kind or any failure in its protection measures  could severely disrupt the Company’s operations, including its  manufacturing, design and engineering processes, and could have  a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, financial  condition and results of operations.
The Company may be materially and adversely affected by the  divulgence of confidential information.
Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures  to protect confidential information such as key contractual  provisions, future projects, and customer records, such information  may be divulged, including as a result of hacking or other threats  from cyberspace.
If this occurs, the Company could be subject to  claims by affected parties, negative publicity and loss of proprietary  information, all of which could have an adverse and material impact  on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition, results  of operations and cash flows.
The Company’s insurance coverage may not be adequate to  protect against all potential losses to which the Company  may be subject, and this may have a material adverse effect  on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of  operations.
While the Company believes that the insurance coverage that it  maintains is reasonably adequate to cover all normal risks associated  with the operation of its business, there can be no assurance that  the Company’s insurance coverage will be sufficient, that any claim  under its insurance policies will be honored fully or in a timely  manner, or that the Company’s insurance premiums will not increase  substantially.
There can be no assurance that any claim under the  Company’s insurance policies will be honoured fully or timely, the  Company’s insurance coverage will be sufficient in any respect or  its insurance premiums will not change substantially.
Accordingly,  to the extent that the Company suffers loss or damage that is not  covered by insurance or that exceeds the Company’s insurance  coverage, or are required to pay higher insurance premiums, the  Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations  may be materially and adversely affected.
The Company’s business could be negatively affected by the  actions of activist shareholders.
Certain of the Company’s shareholders may from time to time  advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect  changes or acquire control over the Company’s business.
Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly listed  companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase  short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions  such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special  dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire  Company, or by voting against proposals put forward by the  board of directors and management of the Company.
If faced with  actions by activist shareholders, the Company may not be able to  respond effectively to such actions, which could be disruptive to  its business.
Political and Regulatory Risks India’s obligations under the World Trade Organization  Agreement could materially affect the Company’s business.
India’s obligations under its World Trade Organization agreement  could reduce the present level of tariffs on imports of components  and vehicles.
Reductions of import tariffs could result in increased  competition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect  the Company’s sales, business, financial condition and results of  operations.
New or changing laws, regulations and government policies  regarding increased fuel economy, reduced greenhouse gas  and other emissions, vehicle safety and taxes may have  significant impact on the Company’s business As an automobile company, the Company is subjected to extensive  governmental regulations regarding vehicle emission levels,  noise, safety and levels of pollutants generated by its production  facilities.
In particular, the United States and Europe have stringent  regulations relating to vehicle emissions.
The contemplated  tightening of vehicle emissions regulations by the European Union  will require significant costs for compliance.
In China, further  regulations are being introduced by Chinese government in the  short to medium term future relating to greenhouse gas emissions  and other environmental concerns.
While the Company is pursuing  various technologies in order to meet the required standards in  the various countries in which it sells its vehicles, the costs for  compliance with these required standards may be significant to  the Company’s operations and may adversely impact its results  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 130 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 of operations.
They may also result in limiting the type of vehicles  the Company sells and where the Company sells them, which may  affect the Company’s revenues.
In order to comply with current and future safety and  environmental norms, the Company may have to incur additional  capital expenditure and Research & Development expenditure to (i)  operate and maintain the Company’s production facilities, (ii) install  new emissions controls or reduction technologies, (iii) purchase  or otherwise obtain allowances to emit greenhouse gases, (iv)  administer and manage the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions  program, and (v) invest in Research and Development to upgrade  products and manufacturing facilities.
If the Company is unable to  develop commercially viable technologies or otherwise unable to  attain compliance within the time frames set by the new standards,  the Company could face significant civil penalties or be forced to  restrict product offerings significantly.
For example, in the United  States, manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if  they fail to meet federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE,  standards.
These penalties are calculated at $5.50 for each tenth  of a mile below the required fuel efficiency level for each vehicle  sold in a model year in the U.S. market.
As with many European  manufacturers, since 2010, Jaguar Land Rover has paid total  penalties of US$46 million for its failure to meet CAFE standards.
Jaguar Land Rover could incur a substantial increase in these  penalties, including as a result of announced increases in CAFE civil  penalties to adjust for inflation.
Moreover, safety and environmental  standards may at times impose conflicting imperatives, which pose  engineering challenges and would, among other things, increase  the Company’s costs.
The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017 has been passed in Lok  Sabha on April 10, 2017 and presently the Bill is under scrutiny of the  Rajya Sabha.
This Bill addresses various issues regarding road safety,  traffic management & other matters.
It provides for the imposition  of hefty penalties on vehicle manufacturers found producing faulty  vehicles.
The Bill proposes for a National Road Safety Board, to be  created by the Central Government through a notification.
The  Board will provide advice to the Central and State Governments on  all aspects of road safety and traffic management.
The Government of India had proposed a comprehensive national  goods and services tax, or GST, regime that would combine taxes  and levies by the central and state governments into one unified  rate structure.
While both the Government of India and state  governments of India have publicly announced that all committed  incentives will be protected following the implementation of the  GST, given the limited availability of information on incentives and  refunds, the Company is unable to provide any assurance as to this  or any other aspect of the tax regime following implementation of  the GST.
The Central Goods and Services Tax Bill (CGST), the Integrated  Goods and Services Tax Bill (IGST) the Goods and Services Tax  (Compensation to States) Bill and the Union Territory Goods and  Services Tax Bill (UTGST) were passed by Lok Sabha on April 6, 2017  and so far 17 States have passed SGST Laws as on May 23, 2017.
The Government of India has publicly announced its intention to  implement the GST on July 1 2017.
With the progress made so far,  this seems to be a realistic timeline.
Imposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to limit  the use of automobiles could adversely affect the demand for  the Company’s vehicles and the Company’s results of operations.
Changes in corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes  in export and other incentives given by various governments or  import or tariff policies could also adversely affect the Company’s  results of operations.
For instance, the United Kingdom’s exit from  the European Union would result in material changes to the  UK’s tax, tariff and fiscal policies.
In addition, the incoming U.S.  presidential administration could seek to introduce changes to laws  and policies governing international trade and impose additional  tariffs and duties on foreign vehicle imports, which could have  a material adverse effect on the Company’s sales in the United  States.
Furthermore, Brazil in recent years increased import duty on  foreign vehicles, which put pressure on sales margins in Brazil and  prompted the Company to enter into discussions with the Brazilian  government to exempt a certain number of imported vehicles from  the increased tariff.
Such government actions may be unpredictable  and beyond the Company’s control, and any adverse changes in  government policy could have a material adverse effect on the  Company’s business prospects, results of operations and financial  condition.
Evaluating and estimating the Company’s provision and accruals for  the Company’s taxes requires significant judgement.
As the Company  conducts its business, the final tax determination may be uncertain.
The Company operates in multiple geographical markets and the  Company’s operations in each market are susceptible to additional  tax assessments and audits.
The Company’s collaborations with  business partners are similarly susceptible to such tax assessments.
Authorities may engage in additional reviews, inquiries and audits  that disrupt the Company’s operations or challenge the Company’s  conclusions regarding tax matters.
Any resulting tax assessment  may be accompanied by a penalty or additional fee for failing to  Notice Board’s Report Corporate Governance Report Business Responsibility ReportManagement Discussion & Analysis (118-165) 131 make the initial payment.
The Company’s tax rates may be affected  by earnings estimation errors, losses in jurisdictions that do not  grant a related tax benefit, changes in currency rates, acquisitions,  investments, or changes in laws, regulations, or practices.
Additionally, government fiscal pressures may increase the likelihood  of adverse or aggressive interpretations of tax laws or regulations or  the imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes, interest charges and  penalties.
Tax assessments may be levied even where the Company  considers its practices to comply with tax laws and regulations.
Should the Company challenge such taxes or believe them to  be without merit, the Company may nonetheless be required to  pay them?
These amounts may be materially different from the  Company’s expected tax assessments and could additionally result  in expropriation of assets, attachment of additional securities, liens,  imposition of royalties or new taxes and requirements for local  ownership or beneficiation.
Regulations in the areas of investments, taxes and levies may also  have an impact on Indian securities, including the Company’s  Shares and ADSs.
In 2014, the antitrust regulator in China, the Bureau of Price  Supervision and Anti-Monopoly of the National Development and  Reform Commission (the ‘‘NDRC’’), launched an investigation into  the pricing practices of more than 1,000 Chinese and international  companies in the automotive industry, including Jaguar Land Rover  and many of its competitors.
The NDRC has reportedly imposed  fines on certain of the Company’s international competitors as  a result of anti-competitive practices pertaining to vehicle and  spare-part pricing.
In response to this investigation, Jaguar Land  Rover established a process to review our pricing in China and  announced reductions in the manufacturer’s suggested retail price  for the 5.0-liter V8 models, which include the Range Rover, Range  Rover Sport and F-Type and the price of certain of our spare parts.
Further imposition of price reductions and other actions taken in  relation to Jaguar Land Rover’s products may significantly reduce  its revenues and profits generated by operations in China and have  a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and  results of operations.
As a result, the Jaguar Land Rover’s attempts  to offset the potential decline in revenue and profits by increasing  operational efficiencies and leveraging economies of scale (for  example, through local production in China) may fail or not be as  successful as expected.
Furthermore, any regulatory action taken or  penalties imposed by regulatory authorities may have significant  adverse financial and reputational consequences on the Company’s  business and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s  results of operations and financial condition.
On March 29, 2017, the Supreme Court of India prohibited the sale  and registration of Bharat Stage III vehicles from April 1, 2017.
The  Supreme Court’s judgment overturned a government regulation,  and was unexpected.
The Government of India has applied to the  Supreme Court for a grant of appropriate time for manufacturers to  dispose Bharat Stage III vehicles in their inventory.
This application  is currently pending.
Similarly a review petition filed by the Society  of Indian Manufacturers, or SIAM, is also currently pending.
The  Supreme Court’s decision resulted in a provision of R148 crores  for the unsold inventory of BSIII vehicles at the year end of March  31, 2017.
The Company cannot guarantee a favorable outcome  for either the Government of India’s application or SIAM’s review  petition.
Any future potential or real unexpected change in law  could havecould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s  business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company may be affected by competition law in India and  any adverse application or interpretation of the Competition  Act could adversely affect the Company’s business.
The Indian Competition Act oversees practices having an  appreciable adverse effect on competition, or AAEC, in a given  relevant market in India.
Under the Competition Act, any formal or  informal arrangement, understanding or action in concert, which  causes or is likely to cause an AAEC, is considered void and results  in imposition of substantial penalties.
Consequently, all agreements  entered into by the Company could be within the purview of the  Competition Act.
Furthermore, any agreement among competitors  which directly or indirectly involves determination of purchase or  sale prices, limits or controls production, sharing the market by way  of geographical area or number of subscribers in the relevant market  or which directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging or collusive  bidding is presumed to have an AAEC in the relevant market in  India and is considered void.
The Competition Act also prohibits  abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise.
The Company  cannot predict with certainty the impact of the provisions of the  Competition Act on the Company’s agreements at this stage.
On March 4, 2011, the Government of India issued and brought  into force the combination regulation (merger control) provisions  under the Competition Act with effect from June 1, 2011.
These  provisions require acquisitions of shares, voting rights, assets or  control or mergers or amalgamations that cross the prescribed  asset- and turnover-based thresholds to be mandatorily notified  to and pre-approved by the Competition Commission of India, or  CCI.
Additionally, on May 11, 2011, the CCI issued the Competition  Commission of India (Procedure for Transaction of Business Relating  Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 132 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 (as amended), which sets out  the mechanism for the implementation of the merger control  regime in India.
Furthermore, the CCI has extraterritorial powers and can investigate  any agreements, abusive conduct or combination occurring outside  India if such agreement, conduct or combination has an AAEC in  India.
The CCI has initiated an inquiry against the Company and other  car manufacturers, collectively referred to hereinafter as the OEMs,  pursuant to an allegation that genuine spare parts of automobiles  manufactured by the OEMs were not made freely available in the  open market in India and, accordingly, anti-competitive practices  were carried out by the OEMs.
If the Company is adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by the  application or interpretation of any provision of the Competition  Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the CCI, or  any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or  prosecution by the CCI or if any prohibition or substantial penalties  are levied under the Competition Act, it could adversely affect the  Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with new or changing corporate governance  and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to the  Company’s compliance policies and increases the Company’s  costs of compliance.
The Company is subjected to a complex and continuously  changing regime of laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to  accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission, or SEC, regulations, Securities and Exchange Board of  India, or SEBI, regulations, New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, listing  rules, and the Companies Act, as well as Indian stock market listing  regulations.
New or changed laws, rules, regulations and standards  may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations.
As  an example, pursuant to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act, which contains significant corporate  governance and executive compensation-related provisions, the  SEC has adopted additional rules and regulations in areas such as  “say on pay” .
Similarly, under applicable Indian laws, for example,  remuneration packages may, in certain circumstances, require  shareholders’ approval.
The Company’s management and other  personnel may be required to devote a substantial amount of  time to such compliance initiatives.
Their application in practice  may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory  and governing bodies.
This could result in continuing uncertainty  regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as  a result of ongoing revisions to such governance standards.
The  Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate  governance and public disclosure.
However, the Company’s efforts  to comply with evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in  this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in,  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of  management resources and time.
The Companies Act has effected significant changes to the  existing Indian Company law framework, which may subject the  Company to higher compliance requirements and increase the  Company’s compliance costs.
The Companies Act brought into  effect significant changes to the Indian Company law framework,  such as in the provisions related to the issue of capital (including  provisions in relation to issue of securities on a private placement  basis), disclosures in offering documents, corporate governance  norms, accounting policies and audit matters, related party  transactions, introduction of a provision allowing the initiation  of class action suits in India against companies by shareholders  or depositors, a restriction on investment by an Indian Company  through more than two layers of subsidiary investment companies  (subject to certain permitted exceptions), prohibitions on loans to  directors and insider trading, including restrictions on derivative  transactions concerning a Company’s securities by directors and  key managerial personnel.
The Company is also required to spend,  in each financial year, at least 2% of the Company’s average net  profits during the three immediately preceding financial years,  calculated for Tata Motors Limited on a standalone basis under Ind  AS, toward corporate social responsibility activities.
Furthermore,  the Companies Act imposes greater monetary and other liability  on the Company and it’s directors for any non-compliance.

Jaguar Land Rover — Competition  Jaguar Land Rover operates in a globally competitive environment  and faces competition from established premium and other vehicle  manufacturers who aspire to move into the premium performance  car and premium SUV markets, some of which are much larger  than they are.
Jaguar vehicles compete primarily against other  European brands such as Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes Benz.
Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles compete largely against SUVs  from companies such as Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes Benz,  Porsche, Volvo and Volkswagen.
Jaguar Land Rover — Seasonality  Jaguar Land Rover volumes are impacted by the biannual change  in age related registration plates of vehicles in the United Kingdom,  where new age related plate registrations take effect in March and  September.
This has an impact on the resale value of the vehicles  because sales are clustered around the time of the year when the  vehicle registration number change occurs.
Seasonality in most  other markets is driven by introduction of new model year vehicles  and derivatives.
Furthermore, Western European markets tend to be  impacted by summer and winter holidays, and the Chinese market  tends to be affected by the Lunar New Year holiday in either January  or February, the PRC National Day holiday and the Golden Week  holiday in October.
The resulting sales profile influences operating  results on a quarter to quarter basis.

This information is given to  enable the readers to understand the performance of Jaguar Land  Rover on a consolidated basis for the Jaguar Land Rover group.
Revenues for Jaguar Land Rover for Fiscal 2017 were GB£24,339  million, an increase of 9.2% compared to GB£22,286 million in Fiscal  2016, driven primarily by increased wholesale volumes and a more  favourable foreign exchange environment with the weaker pound  following Brexit.
Material and other cost of sales in Fiscal 2017 were GB£15,071  million were 12.4% higher compared to the GB£13,405 million in  Fiscal 2016 (and increased as a proportion of revenue to 61.9% in  Fiscal 2017 compared to 60.1% in Fiscal 2016) primarily driven by  the increase in sales volumes and the weaker pound.
Employee costs increased by 7.3% to GB£2,490 million in Fiscal 2017  compared to GB£2,321 million in Fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting  increased headcount in manufacturing (to support the increase in  production volumes) and product development to support Jaguar  Land Rover’s plans to launch new models.
Corporate Overview Financial StatementsStatutory Reports 166 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 Other expenses (net of income) increased by 9.9% to GB£4,997  million in Fiscal 2017 compared to GB£4,546 million in Fiscal 2016  primarily reflecting higher costs related to freight and distribution,  warranty, selling and fixed marketing expense and launch costs.
In Fiscal 2017 there was an accounting policy change to reclassify  gains and losses on revenue and cost hedges from “Other Expense”  to “Revenue” and “Material and Other Cost” respectively which the  Company believe more appropriately reflects the intent of these  hedges.
This change is also reflected in the financial statements of  the prior year.
Product development costs capitalized increased by 14.8% to  GB£1,426 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to GB£1,242 million in  Fiscal 2016 due primarily to expenditure on the development of  future products and technologies.
EBITDA was GB£2,955 million (12.1% margin) in Fiscal 2017, down  6.1% compared to the EBITDA of GB£3,147 million (14.1% margin)  in Fiscal 2016 due to the factors described above.
EBIT was GB£1,458 million (6.0% margin) in Fiscal 2017, down 18.7%  compared to the EBIT of GB£1,793 million (8.0% margin) in Fiscal  2016 due to the lower EBITDA as well as an increase in depreciation  and amortization, partially offset by higher profits from company’s  China joint venture.
Profit before tax (“PBT”) increased by 3.4% to GB£1,610 million in  Fiscal 2017 compared to GB£1,557 million in Fiscal 2016, reflecting  the lower EBIT and more unfavourable revaluation of unrealized  foreign currency debt and hedges, offset by lower net finance  expense, favourable revaluation of commodity hedges and GB£151  million of further insurance and other recoveries related to Tianjin  (compared to the GB£157 million net charge incurred in Fiscal 2016).
Profit after tax (“PAT”) decreased by 3.0% to GB£1,272 million in  Fiscal 2017 compared to GB£1,312 million in Fiscal 2016.
However,  the effective tax rate of 21.0% in Fiscal 2017 was higher than the  15.7% in Fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting the non-recurrence of  favourable deferred tax credits in Fiscal 2016 (£74 million related to  UK Patent Box legislation).
Net cash generated from operating activities was GB£3,160  million in Fiscal 2017 compared to GB£3,556 million in Fiscal 2017  driven by solid profitability, positive working capital and non- cash accruals of GB£467 million (positive working capital and  non-cash accruals of GB£547 million in Fiscal 2016) and a GB£68  million dividend received from the China joint venture partially  offset by GB£199 million of tax paid.
After GB£3,070 million of  total investment spending (excluding GB£368 million of research  & development already expensed through the income statement)  and GB£110 million of other income (primarily interest received  and foreign exchange gains on deposits) free cash flow before  financing was GB£295 million.
Increases in debt of GB£841 million  primarily reflects the approx.
GB£857 million of bonds issued in  January 2017 and a GB£45 million increase in the utilization of  the invoice discounting facility offset by the redemption of the  remaining US$84 million (GB£57 million) 8.125% notes due 2021  and lease payments of GB£4 million.
Finance expenses and fees,  primarily relating to interest payments on outstanding bonds  and fees relating to financing facilities were GB£150 million and  a dividend of GB£150 million was also paid to Tata Motors in  June 2016.
As at March 31, 2017, Jaguar Land Rover had a total  cash balance of GB£5,487 million (comprised of GB£2,878 million  of cash and cash equivalents and GB£2,609 million of financial  deposits) compared to GB£4,651 million of total cash at March  31, 2016 (which comprised of GB£3,399 million of cash and cash  equivalents and GB£1,252 million of financial deposits).

34382) F-3 ANNEXURE “A” TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  (Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date to the Members of Tata Motors Limited) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013  (“the Act”) We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of TATA MOTORS LIMITED (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2017 in conjunction with  our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date which includes internal financial controls over financial  reporting of the Company’s Joint Operations which are companies incorporated in India.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Boards of Directors of the Company and its Joint Operation Companies incorporated in India are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its Joint Operation Companies  incorporated in India based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of  the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting  was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and  their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls  over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls  system over financial reporting of the Company and its Joint Operation Companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and  fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are  being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override  of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls  over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of  changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-4 (Standalone) 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its Joint Operation Companies have, in all material  respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively  as at March 31, 2017, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company and its Joint Operation Companies considering  the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India.

NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-15 (k) P roperty, plant and equipment   P roperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation less accumulated impairment, if any.
F reehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated.
C ost includes purchase price, taxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the  asset is ready for its intended use.
I nterest cost incurred for constructed assets is capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for  financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
D epreciation is provided on the Straight Line Method (SLM) over the estimated useful lives of the assets considering the nature, estimated usage, operating  conditions, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers warranties and maintenance support.
Taking into account these  factors, the Company has decided to apply the useful life for various categories of property, plant & equipment, which are different from those prescribed in  Schedule II of the Act.
Estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:    T ype of Asset        E stimated useful life     Buildings, Roads, Bridges and culverts    4 t o 60 years     Plant, machinery and equipment    8 t o 20 years     Computers and other IT assets    4 t o 6 years     Vehicles    4 t o 10 years     Furniture, fixture and office appliances    5 t o 15 years    The useful lives is reviewed at least at each year end.
Changes in expected useful lives are treated as change in accounting estimate.
A ssets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant  lease.
D epreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.
(l)    Other intangible assets              I ntangible assets purchased are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any.
Amor tization is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as per details below:   Type of asset Estimated amortization period    Technological know-how 8 to 10 years    Software 4 years  T he amortization period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at each year-end.
Changes in expected useful lives are treated as  changes in accounting estimates    I nternally generated intangible assets  R esearch costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred.
P roduct development costs incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognized as intangible assets, when feasibility  has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and it is probable that asset will  generate probable future economic benefits.
T he costs capitalized include the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overhead expenditure incurred up to the date the asset is available  for use.
I nterest cost incurred is capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or  the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
P roduct development costs are amortised over a period of 120 months for New Generation vehicles and powertrains on the basis of higher of the volumes  between planned and actuals and on a straight line method over a period of 36 months for Vehicle Variants, Derivatives and other Regulatory Projects.
C apitalized development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any.
(m)  G oodwill  C ash generating units to which goodwill is allocated are tested for impairment annually at each balance sheet date, or more frequently when there is an  indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment  loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of  carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Goodwill impairment loss recognized is not reversed in subsequent period.
(n)  L eases       A t the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease  arrangement.
NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-16 (Standalone) 72nd Annual Report 2016-17  A ssets taken on finance lease  A  finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of  the minimum lease payments.
Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance  with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense  and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic  rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
A ssets taken on operating lease  L eases other than finance leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company’s balance sheet.
Payments made under  operating leases are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(o ) I mpairment   A t each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that any property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite  lives may be impaired.
If any such impairment exists the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any.
Where  it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to  which the asset belongs.
I ntangible assets not yet available for use, are tested for impairment annually at each balance sheet date, or earlier, if there is an indication that the asset may  be impaired.
R ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to  their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
I f the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash- generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.

The details of the demands for more than  R20 crores are as follows:   A s at March 31, 2017, the Excise Authorities had denied a CENVAT credit of R29.43 crores and imposed a penalty of R Nil for the period between April 2011  to September 2012 (R52.41 crores and a R23.00 crores CENVAT credit and penalty, respectively, as at March 31, 2016 and R52.41 crores and a R23.00 crores  CENVAT credit and penalty, respectively, as at April 1, 2015) in respect of consulting engineering services alleged to have been used exclusively for producing  prototypes at the Engineering Research Centre, in Pune.
The contention of the Excise Authorities is that since the Company claims exemptions from CENVAT  under Notification No.167/71-CE, dated September 11, 1971, the Company is not entitled to avail service tax credits on consulting engineering services used in  the Engineering Research Centre.
The matter is being contested by the Company before the appellate authorities.
The Company believes it has a merit in its case,  since the consulting engineering services are not exclusively used in the manufacture of prototypes and they form part of the assessable value of final products  manufactured by the Company on which CENVAT is paid.
T he Excise Authorities have raised a demand for R90.72 crores as at March 31, 2017 (R90.72 crores as at March 31, 2016 and R90.72 crores as at April 1, 2015),  on account of alleged undervaluation’s of ex-factory discounts given by Company on passenger vehicles through invoices.

Quot ed prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
This category consists of quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.
V aluation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included  within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices).
This level of hierarchy include Company’s over-the- counter (OTC) derivative contracts.
V aluation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices  from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
T here has been no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
C osts of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and  cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.
These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.
Instead, they are held for medium or long term  strategic purpose.
Upon the application of Ind AS 109, the group has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI as the directors believes this  provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss.

T he fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price and for other borrowings the fair value is estimated  by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return, adjusted for the credit spread considered by the lenders for  instruments of similar maturity.
M anagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments.
However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could  have realized or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates.
As such, the fair value of the financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be  different from the amounts reported at each year end.

T he Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the financial assets and  liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks.
The risk management policy is approved by the board of directors.
The risk management framework aims  to:  •  Cr eate a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s business plan.
•  A chieve greater predictability to earnings by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.
(i)  M arket risk  M arket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a  financial instrument.
The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,  equity price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes.
Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable  accuracy.
(a)  F oreign currency exchange rate risk: The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and equity, where any  transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates.
The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, Euro, GBP and Thai Baht against the functional currencies  of the Company.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange  and interest rate exposure.
Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the Company’s exports and cost of borrowings and  consequently may increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.
The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It hedges a part of  these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with its risk management policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated for each currency by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure of a currency  and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the foreign exchange rates of each currency by 10%.

10% appreciation/depreciation of the respective foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of the Company would result in decrease/increase in the Company’s net profit/(loss)  before tax by approximately R110.55 crores and R616.60 crores for financial assets and financial liabilities respectively for the year ended March 31, 2015.
(Note: The impact is indicated on the profit/(loss) before tax basis.)
NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-53 (b) I nterest rate risk  I nterest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates.
Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the  Company’s cash flows as well as costs.
T he Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities.
The Company’s interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.
The Company also uses a mix of interest rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like short-term  loans.
A s at March 31, 2017 and 2016, financial liability of R3,418.97 crores and R4,848.39 crores, respectively, was subject to variable interest rates.
Increase/decrease of  100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in decrease/increase in profit/(loss) before tax of R34.19 crores and R48.48 crores for the year  ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
T he model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve.
Although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities  or periods to re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates.
Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may  fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag.
T he risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves.
This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the  balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.
The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the  average debt outstanding during the period.
T his analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
(Not e: The impact is indicated on the profit/(loss) before tax basis).
(c) E quity Price risk  E quity Price Risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.
T he fair value of some of the Company’s investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income exposes the Company to equity price risks.
These  investments are subject to changes in the market price of securities.
The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as at March 31, 2017, 2016 and  April 1, 2015 was R218.18 crores, R143.34 crores and R143.53 crores, respectively.
A 10% change in equity price as at March 31, 2017, 2016 and April 1, 2015 would  result in an impact of R21.82 crores, R14.43 crores and R14.35 crores, respectively   (Not e: The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any).

Trade receivables consist of a large number of various types of customers, spread across geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition  of these trade receivables and where appropriate allowance for losses are provided.
Further, the Company groups the trade receivables depending on type of customers and accordingly credit risk is determined.
(ii) C redit risk  Cr edit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk encompasses  both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.
F inancial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of investments classified as fair value through profit or loss, trade receivables, loans  and advances and derivative financial instruments.
None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of exposure to credit risks.
Exposur e to credit risk  T he carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk was R5,732.64 crores as at March 31, 2017,  R5,717.59 crores as at March 31, 2016, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, short term deposits with banks, trade receivables, finance receivables,  margin money and other financial assets excluding equity investments.
F inancial assets that are neither past due nor impaired  None of the C ompany’s cash equivalents, including time deposits with banks, are past due or impaired.
Regarding trade receivables and other receivables, and other loans  or receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there were no indications as at March 31, 2017, that defaults in payment obligations will occur.
I n addition, exposure to credit risk is also in relation to financial guarantee contracts for which the Company has created a liability for potentional exposures.
NOTES FORMING PART OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-55 (iii) Liquidit y risk  Liquidit y risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations.
The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that  funds are available for use as per requirements.
T he Company has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks.
Further, the Company has access to funds from debt markets through commercial  paper programs, non-convertible debentures, senior notes and other debt instruments.
The Company invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposit and liquid and liquid plus  schemes of mutual funds, which carry no/low mark to market risks.
The Company has also invested 15% of the non-convertible debentures (taken/issued by the Company) falling due for repayment in the next 12 months in bank deposits, to meet the regulatory norms of liquidity requirements.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its joint operation companies, its associate companies and joint  ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based  on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the  Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its  joint operation companies, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit.
We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance  Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the  Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by other auditors of the subsidiary companies, joint  operations, associate companies and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other  Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the  internal financial controls system over  financial reporting of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its joint operation companies, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which  are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)  F-73 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial  reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of the reports of  other auditors referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its joint operation companies, its associate  companies and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls  system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2017, based  on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India.
Other Matters Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls over financial  reporting in so far as it relates to one subsidiary company and two associate companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based solely  on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

Signific ant accounting policies   a.
S tatement of compliance      I n accordance with the notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Company has adopted Indian Accounting Standards (referred  to as “Ind AS”) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 with effect from April 1, 2016.
Previous period figures  have been restated to Ind AS.
In accordance with Ind AS 101 First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standard, the Company has presented a  reconciliation from the presentation of financial statements under Accounting Standards notified under the Companies (Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2006 (“Previous GAAP”) to Ind AS of Shareholders’ equity as at March 31, 2016 and April 1, 2015 and of the total comprehensive income for  the year ended March 31, 2016.
T hese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Ind AS as notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,  2015 read with Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
b.
B asis of preparation      T he consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments measured at fair value at the  end of each reporting period as explained in the accounting policies below.
c .
B asis of consolidation    Subsidiar ies      T he consolidated financial statements include Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company (a) has power over the investee, (b) it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with  the investee and (c) has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls  an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements listed above.
In assessing control,  potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed off during the year are  included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
I nter-company transactions and balances including unrealized profits are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non- controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company’s equity.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate  share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non- controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it  results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
Changes  in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The carrying  amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the  subsidiaries.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid  or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.
When the C ompany loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair  value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill),  and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.
Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to  the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e., reclassified to profit or loss) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were  disposed off.
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on  initial recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the  cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-81   I nterests in joint arrangements      A joint ar rangement is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of  an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Join t operations      C ertain of the Company’s activities, are conducted through joint operations, which are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint  control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The Company recognizes, in the  consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other  partners, along with its share of income from the sale of the output and any assets, liabilities and expenses that it has incurred in relation to the joint  operation.
Join t ventures      A joint v enture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
The results, assets and liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described  below.
Associates      A ssociates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and  operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control those policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Company  holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these  financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.
E quity method of accounting (equity accounted investees)      An int erest in an associate or joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date in which the investee becomes an associate or  a joint venture and are recognized initially at cost.
The Company’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated  impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s share of profits or losses and equity movements of equity accounted  investees, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.
When  the Company’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term  investments in the nature of net investments) is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the  Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.
When the C ompany transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Company, unrealized profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the  Company’s interest in its associate or joint venture.
d .
Business c ombination      A cquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Acquisition related costs are recognized in profit or loss  as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognized at their fair  value at the acquisition date, except certain assets and liabilities required to be measured as per the applicable standard.
P urchase consideration in excess of the Company’s interest in the acquiree’s net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is  recognized as goodwill.
Excess of the Company’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  over the purchase consideration is recognized, after reassessment of fair value of net assets acquired, in the Capital Reserve.
e.  U se of estimates and judgments      T he preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions, that affect  the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and  liabilities at the date of these financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented.
Actual results may  differ from these estimates.
Estimat es and underlying assumptions are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in  which the estimate is revised and future periods affected.
I n particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most  significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are included in the following notes:     i)  Not e 5 - Impairment of goodwill     ii)  Not e 6 - Impairment of indefinite life intangible assets     iii)  Not e 20 - Recoverability/recognition of deferred tax assets     iv)  Not e 28 - Provision for product warranty     v)  Not e 36 - Assets and obligations relating to employee benefits  NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-82 (Consolidated) 72nd Annual Report 2016-17  f .

Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between  the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to  produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
A ssets taken on operating lease      L eases other than finance leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company’s balance sheet.
Payments made  under operating leases are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Impairment    i) G oodwill      C ash generating units to which goodwill is allocated are tested for impairment annually at each balance sheet date, or more frequently when there  is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the  impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata  on the basis of carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Goodwill impairment loss recognized is not reversed in subsequent period.
ii) P roperty, plant and equipment and other intangible assets      A t each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is any indication that any property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with  finite lives may be impaired.
If any such impairment exists the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if  any.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash- generating unit to which the asset belongs.
I ntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use, are tested for impairment annually at each balance sheet  date, or earlier, if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
R ecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are  discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
I f the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or  cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
A s at March 31, 2017, none of the Company’s property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were considered impaired.

F inancial instruments     i) Classifica tion, initial recognition and measurement      A financial instrument is an y contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
Financial assets other than equity instruments are classified into categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and at amortised cost.
Financial assets that are equity instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities.
F inancial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
I nitially, a financial instrument is recognized at its fair value.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments  are recognized in determining the carrying amount, if it is not classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Subsequently, financial instruments are  measured according to the category in which they are classified.
F inancial assets at amortised cost: Financial assets having contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments  of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold such assets in order to  collect such contractual cash flows are classified in this category.
Subsequently, these are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest  method less any impairment losses.
E quity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income: These include financial assets that are equity instruments and are  designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably.
Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein, are recognized directly  in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Dividends fr om these equity investments are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the right to receive payment has been established.
When the equit y investment is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to retained earnings.
F inancial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured  at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.

These are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of profit  and loss.
O ther financial liabilities: These are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
ii) D etermination of fair value:      T he fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the consideration given or received).

Current investments are carried at the lower of cost or  market value, while long term investments are carried at cost less any impairment that is other than temporary.
Under I nd AS, equity investments have been classified as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
Fair value movements are  recognized directly in other comprehensive income on such investments.
Investments in Mutual Funds have been classified as Fair value through  Profit or Loss (FVTPL) and fair value changes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
(b )   Dividends Under Ind AS, dividends payable are recorded as a liability in the year in which these are declared and approved.
Under Previous GAAP , dividends  payable were recorded as a liability in the year to which they relate.
(c)   P rovision for expected credit losses Impairment of finance receivables is measured at an amount equal to twelve month expected losses if credit risk on such assets has not increased  significantly since initial recognition.
An allowance equal to lifetime expected losses is provided if credit risks has increased significantly from the  date of initial recognition.
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-92 (Consolidated) 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 Under Previous GAAP , such estimates were determined based on experience of historic losses on such contracts.
I mpairment for trade receivable is measured in Ind AS based on life time expected credit losses.
Expected credit loss allowance is measured based on  historical credit loss experience, defaults, bankruptcy and forward looking information where relevant adjusted for probability of recovery.
Under Previous GAAP , provision for trade receivable is measured based on factors such as age of receivables, defaults etc.
adjusted for probability of  recovery.
(d)   G ain on fair value of below market interest loans Under Ind AS, below market interest rate loan received is recorded at fair value by using an appropriate discount rate on date of obtaining the loan.
The  difference between the fair value and the amount received is recognised as a gain in profit or loss as per Ind AS 20.
The interest expense is recorded  periodically till the maturity of the loan based on effective interest method.
Under Previous GAAP , the loan were recorded same as the amount received.
(e)  P roperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets  On the date of transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure certain items of Property, Plant and Equipment and intangible assets at fair value  and use that fair value as its deemed cost.
The aggregate fair values of Property, Plant and Equipment is R5,859.48 crores and of related intangible assets  is R1,891.97 crores.
Fair value adjustments recorded to the carrying amounts is R3,593.71 crores for Property, Plant and Equipment and R(1,103.22) crores  for related Intangible Assets.
Under I nd AS, all foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in net income except to the extent these are treated as an adjustment  to interest cost and considered for capitalization.
Under Previous GAAP , foreign exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated  borrowings that were incurred to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were included in the cost of the asset and depreciated over  their remaining useful life.
F urther under Previous GAAP , the cost of property, plant and equipment also included indirectly attributable expenses that are incurred before a property,  plant and equipment is ready for its intended use.
Under Ind AS, such costs are expensed as incurred.
Under I nd AS, import duty waivers for capital assets purchased under Export Promotion Credit Guarantee (EPCG) schemes are recorded as  deferred revenue and recognized in Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related performance obligations are  fulfilled.
On the transition date, the Company, therefore, recorded an adjustment to measure such Property, plant and equipment in accordance  with Ind AS 16.
Under Previous GAAP , cost of the property, plant and equipment was recorded at the cash price paid to acquire such assets.
Consequently, depreciation relating to the above differences in the cost of property, plant and equipment under Ind AS and Previous GAAP has also been  adjusted.
(f )  Ex change gain/(loss) accumulated in foreign currency monetary item translation difference account      Under  Ind AS, all exchange differences are accounted for in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
Under Previous GAAP ,  exchange differences relating to long term foreign currency monetary assets/liabilities were accounted for in the following manner:    a)  Diff erences relating to borrowings attributable to the acquisition of the depreciable capital asset were added to/deducted from the cost of such  capital assets;       b)  O ther differences were accumulated in foreign currency monetary item translation difference account, to be amortized over the period, beginning  April 1, 2011 or date of inception of such item, as applicable, and ending on March 31, 2020 or the date of its maturity, whichever is earlier.
(g)   B asis adjustment for inventories  T he Company have entered into forwards and options to hedge its raw materials inventory purchases.
The unrealised gain/(loss) on such hedges are  recognised in the hedge reserve.
Under Previous GAAP , the gain/(loss) on such hedges are reclassified to profit and loss statement on maturity of such  contracts.
Under Ind AS, the gain/(loss) are recognised in inventory at the time of purchase of raw materials.
(h)   D iscounting of warranty provisions  Under  Previous GAAP , the provision for warranty expenses are not discounted for time value.
Under Ind AS, these provisions are discounted and the time  value is accreted over the warranty period.
(i)   R emeasurement gain/(loss)   Under P revious GAAP , the actuarial gain/(loss) on post retirement employee benefit obligations are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Under  Ind AS, such gain/(loss) are recognised in the Other Comprehensive income.
( j)  Der ecognition of financial instruments    T he Company transfers finance receivables in securitisation transactions/direct assignments.
In such transactions the Company surrenders control over  the receivables though continues to act as an agent for the collection of receivables.
In most of these transactions, the Company also provides credit  enhancement to the transferee.
Because of the existence of credit enhancement in such transactions, under Ind AS, such transfer or assignment does  not meet the derecognition criteria resulting into the transaction not being recorded as sale.
Consequently, the proceeds received from the transfer are  recorded as collateralised debt obligation.
Under the Previous GAAP , the derecognition criteria were different and are based on surrender of control.
The Company meets the criteria under Previous  GAAP for derecognition and accordingly records such transfer as sale.
(k)    D eferred taxes have been recorded under Ind AS for undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and inter company adjustments  with subsidiaries and joint operations, which were not recorded under Previous GAAP .
(l)   F oreign currency translation adjustment:       T hese are consequential translation adjustments on Previous GAAP to Ind AS adjustments.
(m)  Under P revious GAAP , Business Combination are accounted at book value whereas under Ind AS, these are accounted at fair value.
(n)   C ash Flow Statement  Under I nd AS, certain transfer of finance receivables by way of securitisation/direct assignments do not meet the criteria for derecognition.
Consequently,  proceeds received from these transactions are recorded as collateralized debt obligation.
Under Indian GAAP , such transactions meet the criteria for  derecognition and accordingly, recorded as sale.
As a result, under Ind AS , the cash flows from operating activities and cash outflows from financing  activities is higher by R603 crores.

As at March 31, 2017, goodwill of `557.91 crores has been allocated to software consultancy and services cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit  has been determined based on value in use.
Value in use has been determined based on future cash flows, after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future  operating results, growth rates and anticipated future economic conditions.
As at March 31, 2017, the estimated cash flows for a period of 5 years were developed using internal forecasts, and a pre-tax discount rate of 11.78%.
The cash flows beyond 5 years  have been extrapolated assuming 2% growth rates.

The fair value of the awards is calculated using  a Black-Scholes model at the grant date.
The fair value is updated at each reporting date as the awards are accounted for as cash-settled plan.
The inputs into the model are based  on the Tata Motors Limited historic data, the risk-free rate and the weighted average fair value of shares, in the scheme at the reporting date.
The amount expensed in relation to the  LTIP was R70.13 crores and R29.59 crores for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company considers these amounts as not material and accordingly has not  provided further disclosures.

The UK defined benefit schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company.
The trustees of the pension schemes are required by law  to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the schemes and  all other governance matters.
The board of trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the plan’s regulations.
Through its defined benefit pension plans the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below :  A sset volatility    T he plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with references to corporate bond yields; if plan assets under perform compared to the corporate bonds discount rate,  this will create or increase a deficit.
The defined benefit plans hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long- term while providing volatility and risk in the short-term.
A s the plans mature, the Company intends to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.
However, the Company believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is  an appropriate element of the Company’s long term strategy to manage the plans efficiently.
C hanges in bond yields    A decr ease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings and interest  rate hedging instruments.
I nflation risk     S ome of the Company’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary  increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation).
The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging  instruments and also assets which are more closely correlated with inflation.
However an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit to some degree.
Lif e expectancy   T he majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities.
This is  particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

A scaling factor of 120% for males and 110% for females has been used for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 115% for males and 105% for females for the Land Rover Pension Scheme  and 95% for males and 85% for females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan.
F or the valutation as at March 31, 2015, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S1NxA tables and the Light table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension  Plan.
A scaling factor of 115% has been used for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 110% for the Land Rover Pension Scheme, and 105% for males and 90% for females for Jaguar Executive Pension  Plan.
There is an allowance for future improvements in line with the CMI (2014) projections and an allowance for long-term improvements of 1.25% per annum (2016,2015: CMI(2014) projections  with 1.25% per annum improvements).
T he Company noted that on March 27, 2017, a new mortality projection model (CMI (2016)) was released which potentially indicated a small reduction in longevity of, on average, 0.5  years compared to current assumptions.

The split of Level 1 assets is 66% (2016: 63%, 2015: 59%), Level 2 assets 27% (2016: 31%, 2015: 37%) and Level 3 assets 7% (2016: 6%, 2015: 4%).
Private market holdings are classified as Level 3  instruments.
Included in the value for Interest Rate and Inflation derivatives are Repo transactions, as noted above.
The sensitivity analysis below is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions  may be correlated.
When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same methods (present value of the defined benefit obligation  calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the consolidated balance  sheet.

Following the April 5, 2015 valuations, it is intended to eliminate the pension scheme funding deficits over the 10 years  following the valuation date.
As at March 31, 2017, there is no additional liability; however, following the changes to the defined benfit schemes’ rules in April 2017, an additional obligation  may arise in the future.
The current agreed contribution rate for defined benefit accrual is 31% of pensionable salaries in the UK.
Deficit contribution levels remain in line with prior expectation  for 2016-18 and then increase to R508.45 crores per annum to March 2025.
T he average duration of the benefit obligation as at March 31, 2017 is 21.60 years (2016: 20.5 years, 2015: 23.5 years).
On Apr il 3, 2017, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc approved and communicated to its Defined Benefit scheme members that the defined benefit scheme rules were to be amended with  effect from April 6, 2017 so that, amongst other changes, retirement benefits will be calculated on a career average basis rather than based upon a member’s final salary at retirement.
These  changes were effective from April 6, 2017 and as a result of the re-measurement of the scheme’s liabilities, a past service credit of approximately GBP 437 million (R3,536.14 crores) has arisen  and will be recognised in quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Ex cluding this past service credit but allowing for the new benefit structure effective April 6, 2017, the expected net periodic pension cost for the year ended March 31, 2018 is R2,182.81 crores.
The Company expects to pay R2,647.43 crores to its defined benefit schemes in the year ended March 31, 2018.

Quot ed prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
This category consists quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.
V aluation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included  within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices).
This level of hierarchy includes Company’s over-the- counter (OTC) derivative contracts.
V aluation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices  from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-133 (F-52 - F-86)  T he short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated at amortized cost which is approximately equal to their fair value.
D erivatives are fair valued using market observable rates and published prices together with forecast cash flow information where applicable.
T he fair value of finance receivables has been estimated by discounting expected cash flows using rates at which loans of similar credit quality and maturity would be made and  internal assumptions such as expected credit losses and estimated collateral value for repossessed vehicles as at March 31, 2017, 2016 and April 1, 2015.
As unobservable inputs  are applied, finance receivables are classified in Level 3.
T he fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price and for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting  expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return, adjusted for the credit spread considered by the lenders for instruments of the similar  maturity.
C osts of certain unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and  cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.
These investments in equity instruments are not held for trading.
Instead, they are held for medium or long-term  strategic purpose.
Upon the application of Ind AS 109, the Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI as the directors believe that  this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value immediately in profit or loss.
M anagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments.
However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
Therefore, for  substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have realized or paid  in sale transactions as of respective dates.
As such, the fair value of the financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts  reported at each year end.

In such transactions the Company surrenders control over the receivables,  though it continues to act as an agent for the collection of receivables.
In most of these transactions, the Company also provides credit enhancements to the transferee.
Because of the existence of credit enhancements in such transactions, the Company continues to have the obligation to pay to the transferee, limited to the extent of  credit enhancement, even if it does not collect the equivalent amounts from the original asset and continues to retain substantially all risks and rewards associated with  the receivables, and hence, such transfer or assignment does not meet the derecognition criteria resulting into the transfer not being recorded as sale.
Consequently, the  proceeds received from the transfer are recorded as collateralized debt obligation.
Further, the Company transfers certain trade receivables under the debt factoring arrangements.
These do not qualify for derecognition, due to the recourse arrangement in  place.
Consequently the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as loans from banks / financial institutions and classified under short-term borrowings.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and finance receivables along with the associated liabilities is as follows: As at March 31, As at April 1, 2017 2016 2015 Nature of Asset Carrying  amount of  asset sold Carrying  amount of  associated  liabilities Carrying  amount of  asset sold Carrying  amount of  associated  liabilities Carrying  amount of  asset sold Carrying  amount of  associated  liabilities (a) Trade receivables  1,494.87  1,494.87  1,514.35  1,514.35  1,715.43  1,715.43  (b) Finance receivables 1,004.38 1  1,027.12  35.51 1  40.07  583.33 1  616.80  1 Net of provision of R29.00 crores, R9.43 crores and R113.72 crores as at March 31, 2017, 2016 and April 1, 2015, respectively.
Statutory ReportsCorporate Overview Financial Statements F-136 (Consolidated) 72nd Annual Report 2016-17 (c) C ash flow hedges  A s at March 31, 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries have a number of cash flow hedging instruments in a hedging relationship.
The Company and its  subsidiaries uses both U.S. dollar/Pounds sterling forward and option contracts, U.S. dollar/Euro forward contracts and other currency options to hedge  future cash flows from sales and purchases.
The Company and its subsidiaries have designated some of its U.S. dollar denominated bonds as cash flow  hedging instruments of foreign currency risk arising from future anticipated sales.
Cash flow hedges are expected to be recognized in profit or loss during  the years ending March 31, 2018 to 2022.
T he Company and its subsidiaries also have a number of foreign currency derivative contracts, which are entered into as an economic hedge of the financial  risks of the Company.
These contracts do not meet the hedge accounting criteria of Ind AS 109, hence the change in fair value is recognized immediately  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Options ar e designated on spot basis.
The time value of options are identified as cost of hedge.
Changes in the time value of options are recognised in Cost  of Hedge reserve.
Cross currency basis spread arising from forward exchange contracts are considered ineffective in the hedge relationship and thus the  change in fair value of forward exchange contracts attributable to cross currency basis spread are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Changes in fair value of f oreign currency derivatives and bonds, to the extent determined to be an effective hedge, is recognized in other comprehensive  income and the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognized in Statement of Profit and Loss.
A ccordingly, the fair value change arising from foreign currency derivatives and bonds, designated as cash flow hedges of future anticipated sales (net loss)  of R25,861.67 crores, (net loss) R4,006.35 crores, was recognized in other comprehensive income during the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31,  2016, respectively.
Amounts reclassified from hedging reserve of (net loss) R9,928.70 crores and (net gain) R1,365.57 crores during the years ended March  31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been recognised as revenue in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
T he Company and its subsidiaries have entered into forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from  future anticipated purchase of raw materials which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The fair value change (net gain) of R2,026.77 crores and (net gain)  of R2,430.04 crores was recognised in other comprehensive income during the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
Amounts r ecycled from hedging reserve of (net gain) of R1,020.39 crores and (net loss) of R1,902.67 crores was recognized in inventory during the year  ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 respectively in the Balance Sheet.
Changes in fair value attr ibutable to cross currency basis spread in forwards of R231.78 crores (net loss) and R102.93 crores (net loss) during the years  ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been classified as foreign exchange gain/loss in the statement of profit and loss.
Amounts reclassified  from hedging reserve, where forecast sales are no longer expected to occur, amounts to net loss of R367.31 crores and net loss of R19.72 crores during  the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been classified as foreign exchange gain/loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Changes in fair value  of f oreign currency derivatives not hedge accounted of R2,041.94 crores (net loss) and R571.27 crores (net gain) during the years  ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, have been classified as foreign exchange gain/loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-137  (d )  F inancial risk management  I n the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit  risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments.
T he Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities  such as interest rate risks and credit risks.
The risk management policy is approved by the board of directors.
The risk management framework aims to:  •  Cr eate a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s business plan.
•  A chieve greater predictability to earnings by determining the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.
(i)     Market risk  M arket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial  instrument.
The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity price  fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes.
Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.
(i)  - (a) Foreign currency exchange rate risk: The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the Statement of Profit and Loss and equity, where any transaction  references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective  consolidated entities.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in  exchange rates in those countries.
The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Euro,  against the respective functional currencies of Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and  interest rate exposure.
Furthermore, any movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Company against major foreign  currencies may impact the Company’s revenues from its international operations.
Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the  Company’s cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.
The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It hedges a part of these  risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with its risk management policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated for each currency by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure of a currency and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the foreign exchange rates of each currency by 10%.

There is no exposure to the  Statement of Profit and Loss on account of translation of financial statements of consolidated foreign entities.
Furthermore, the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by  some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed at clause (iv) below.
T he following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure (other than risk arising from derivatives disclosed at clause (iv) below) as at March 31, 2017: (R in crores) U.S. dollar Euro Chinese  Renminbi Japanese  Yen Others 1 Total (a) Financial assets 10,498.74 9,862.42  4,000.96 127.98 4,432.32  28,922.42 (b) Financial liabilities  37,547.87 21,301.83  3,399.19 538.22 2,939.25  65,726.36 1 O thers mainly include currencies such as the Russian rouble, Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, Australian dollars, South African rand, Thai baht and Korean won.

(Note: The impact is indicated on the income/loss before tax basis) NOTES FORMING PART OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-139 (i)  -  (b) Interest rate risk  I nterest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates.
Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Company’s  cash flows as well as costs.
T he Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities.
The Company’s interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.
The Company  also uses a mix of interest rate sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like short term non-convertible bonds  and short term loans.
I n its financing business, the Company enters into transactions with customers which primarily result in receivables at fixed rates.
In order to manage this risk, the Company has a  policy to match funding in terms of maturities and interest rates and also for certain part of the portfolio, the Company does not match funding with maturities, in order to take  advantage of market opportunities.
T he Company also enters into arrangements of securitization of receivables in order to reduce the impact of interest rate movements.
Futher, Company also enters in to interst  rate swap contract with banks to manage its interest rate risk.
A s at March 31, 2017, 2016 and April 1, 2015, financial liability of R18,928.36 crores, R22,117.12 crores and R21,583.07 crores respectively, was subject to variable interest rates.
Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact (decrease/increase in case of profit/(loss) before tax of R189.28 crores  and R221.17 crores on income for the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.
T he model assumes that interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve.
Although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to  re-pricing, these may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates.
Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in  market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may change with a lag.
T he risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves.
This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet  date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.
The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding  during the period.
T his analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
(Not e: The impact is indicated on the income/loss before tax basis).
(i)  - (c) Equity price risk  E quity price risk is related to the change in market reference price of the investments in equity securities.
T he fair value of some of the Company’s investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income exposes the Company to equity price risks.
These investments  are subject to changes in the market price of securities.
The fair value of Company’s investment in quoted equity securities as at March 31, 2017 and 2016, was R260.29 crores  and R210.50 crores, respectively.
A 10% change in equity prices as at March 31, 2017 and 2016, would result in an impact of R26.03 crores and R21.05 crores, respectively.
(Not e: The impact is indicated on equity before consequential tax impact, if any).

These financial exposures are managed in accordance with the Company’s risk management policies and procedures.
The Company also enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate currency swap agreements, mainly to manage exposure on its fixed rate or variable rate debt.
The Company  uses interest rate derivatives or currency swaps to hedge exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on principal and interest payments for borrowings denominated in foreign  currencies.
Specific transactional risks include risks like liquidity and pricing risks, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation risks, volatility risks, counterparty risks, settlement risks and  gearing risks.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques based on information derived from observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is as follows: (₹ in crores) As at March 31, As at April 1,  2017 2016 2015 (a) Foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  (21,685.18)  (10,798.79)  (11,839.38) (b) Commodity Derivatives  385.66  (962.81)  (389.01) (c) Others including interest rate and currency swaps  67.52  (116.27)  (5.74) Total  (21,232.00)  (11,877.87)  (12,234.13) The gain/(loss) on commodity derivative contracts, recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss was R918.40 crores and (R1,155.53 crores) for the years ended March 31, 2017  and 2016 respectively.
In respect of the Company’s foreign currency forward and option contracts, a 10% appreciation of the foreign currency underlying such contracts, would have resulted in an  approximate gain/(loss) of (R13,011.69 crores)/(R15,934.81 crores) in the Company’s hedging reserve and an approximate gain/(loss) of R816.50 crores/(R1,172.08 crores)  respectively, in the Company’s Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 respectively.
In respect of the Company’s foreign forward and option contracts, a 10% depreciation of the foreign currency underlying such contracts, would have resulted in an approximate  gain/(loss) of R12,194.42 crores/R16,013.08 crores in the Company’s hedging reserve and an approximate gain/(loss) of (R90.35 crores) and R961.11 crores respectively, in the  Company’s Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 respectively.
In respect of the Company’s commodity derivative contracts, a 10% depreciation/appreciation of all commodity prices underlying such contracts, would have resulted in an  approximate gain/(loss) of (R461.24 crores)/R461.24 crores and (R496.35 crores)/R496.35 crores in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the years ended March 31, 2017 and  2016 respectively.
Exposure to gain/loss on derivative instruments offset to some extent the exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk as disclosed above.
(Note: The impact is indicated on the income/loss before tax basis).
