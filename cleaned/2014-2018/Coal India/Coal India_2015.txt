1.
Importance of coal and Coal India Limited   The world over coal’s contribution towards primary commercial energy is around 30% and coal helps generate 40% of world’s  electricity.
In the Indian context, the importance of coal scales-up higher than the global average.
In India, coal is the mo st  dominant energy fuel meeting around 50% of country's primary commercial energy.
Around 72% of the entire power generated in  the country is coal based.
The pivotal role of coal is expected to continue in the foreseeable future primarily because of abundance  of coal reserves, easy availability and affordability.
As of 1st April 2015, the estimated geological resource of Indian coal stood at  306.59 Billion Tonnes.
And, Coal India Limited is at the vanguard of country’s coal production, producing 82% of the country’s entire coal output.
Coa l  India virtually empowers the power sector in the country with nearly 78% of Coal India’s entire supplies catering to power util ities  of the country.
97 out of 100 Thermal Power Stations in the country receive coal from Coal India.
2.
Accomplishments 2014-15   During 2014-15 the coal production was 494.24 Million Tonnes.
You will be happy to know that stepping into a higher growth  trajectory the increase in absolute terms, FY ending 2015, was nearly 32 Million Tonnes, the highest ever incremental increase  in a single ﬁnancial year since the inception of the company.
The 32 Million Tonne increase is more than the incremental growth  achieved during the previous four ﬁnancial years combined.
Raw coal off-take during FY ending 2015 was 489.38 MTs, an increase of 17.80 MTs on a year-on-year comparison.
Despatch of coal and coal products, to power utilities of the country during 2014-15, registered a healthy growth of 8.9%.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 009 3.
Strategies for Growth   Coal India is faced with challenging targets in the ensuing years.
Going forward now on to meet the production targets, Coal India  needs to step up into double digit growth from that of around 7% achieved during 2014-15.
It is with a feeling of satisfaction I share  with you that during the ﬁrst quarter of 2015-16, Coal India’s production growth was consistently in double digits in each of t he  three months, ending the Q1 on 12% growth.
To sustain the growth momentum in its production and target achievements in the future, Coal India has formulated multi-pronged  strategies.
(i) Critical Railway Links - Collaboration with State Governments & Railways    There are coalﬁelds under Coal India which have large deposits of coal and huge production potential but are not properly  connected through rail links for evacuation of the coal.
Three such coalﬁelds that are expected to play critical role in coal  production once the rail links are commissioned are in Central Coalﬁelds Limited (Jharkhand), Mahandi Coalﬁelds Limited  (Odisha) and South Eastern Coalﬁelds Limited (Chattisgarh).
In a synergic effort with respective State governments and railways, Coal India is actively pursuing the progress of these  railway links.
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPVs) have been formed in a tripartite partnership between Ministry of Railways,  Ministry of Coal and the respective State governments with a win-win strategy for all stakeholders.
Coal India Limited  through  its subsidiaries, Railways nominated agency and the concerned State Govt.
agency will form SPV and construct  arterial lines as a Railways concessionaire.
(ii) Technology Development    (A) Geology    We propose to have    a) more use of Hydrostatic Drilling for high rate - presently 8 in operation, 5 more to be added by 2016-17.    b) more use of geophysical loggers - 5 in operation and 5 more by 15-16.    c) optimisation of number of coring boreholes based on the complexity of geology of the block.
d) more use of 2D/3D Seismic Survey Technology.
(B) Opencast Mines    We propose to promote more of    a) High capacity equipment.
b) Operator independent Truck Dispatch Systems.
c) Vehicle Tracking System using GPS/GPRS.
d) CHP and SILOS for faster loading.
e) Monitoring using Laser Scanners   (C) Underground Mines    We propose to pursue    a) Continuous Miner Technology on large-scale.
b) Long-wall Technology at selected places.
c) Man Riding system in major mines.
d) Use of Tele-monitoring techniques.
Coal India Limited.
A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15010  (iii) Role of HR     Human Resource has to play an active role if Coal India has to achieve the challenging targets in future.
HR Division had  identiﬁed various areas that would supplement Coal India's efforts in this regard and is charting out a plan of recruiting  multi-disciplinary professionals, skill upgradation of existing employees, identifying areas of improvement and such.
Coal India had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) to promote  special education and employment enhancing vocational skills.
4.
Other Improvement Areas   (i) Coal Washing - A step towards Quality improvement      With limited scope of product differentiation, competitiveness of generic products like coal primarily centers around quality  and price.
To make the product better qualitatively, Coal India has decided to bring in consistency in quality by setting up  coal washeries which will result in reducing the ash content and improved consumer satisfaction.
This would also be in sync  with environment friendly measures.
NEERI has been engaged to guide us in the process.
At present, Coal India has a total coal washing capacity of 36.8 million tonnes per year (MTY) through 15 existing washeries,  of which 12 are coking and 3 non coking with 23.30 MTY and 13.50 MTY capacities respectively.
In addition, Coal India plans to set up further 15 washeries having state-of-the-art and innovative technology in coal  beneﬁciation with an aggregate throughput capacity of 112.6 MTY.
Out of these, 6 are coking coal washeries with a  cumulative capacity of 18.6 MTY, and the rest 9 are non-coking coal washeries.
(ii) System Improvements    E-procurement will be universalized and more effectively implemented.
ERP as a route towards organisational synergy will  be fast tracked.
Coal India has already adopted a host of ICT initiatives to make internal processes IT driven and to enhance all round  system efﬁciency and transparency to improve employee, customer and vendors' satisfaction.
We have put in place electronic surveillance initiatives to keep watch on coal stock and track the coal loaded vehicles.
Major initiatives include:   (a) GPS/GPRS based VTS (Vehicle Tracking System) on coal transport vehicles.
(b) OITDS (Operator Independent Truck Dispatch System).
( c )   Installation of CCTV at vulnerable points like entry/exit points, coal stock yards, railway sidings, material stores,  explosive magazines and important ofﬁces.
(d) RFID based boom barriers.
( e )   Wide Area Networking for connecting all the Mines, Projects, Sidings, Weigh Bridges and   HQ through dedicated  network for data transfer and Coalnet implementation.
(f) Installation of in-motion Weigh Bridges with RFID tags.
(g) Weigh Bridge connectivity for weight tracking.
(h) Geo-fencing of mine areas.
Coal India is also adopting improved measurement system of coal and OB through 3D Terrestrial Laser Scanner System  for greater accuracy.
Other initiatives include project monitoring system, land management system, integrated business  solutions, document digitization management and archival system etc.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 011   For greater employee satisfaction, initiatives like Grievance Management System, EIS (Executive Information System), Online ﬁling  of APR, Online PRIDE/PAR (Performance Appraisal Report), Online Vigilance Clearance System, Online CPRMSE (Coal India post- retirement medical scheme for executives) have been undertaken.
5.
Green Initiatives   Coal India is conscious of its commitment towards environment and ecosystem.
The company strives to give back to the nature  to the extent possible what has been pried away from her by taking appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of mining and  associated activities in accordance with EIA / EMP of each project.
Coal India has created a green wealth of about 82 million plants including 15.74 lakhs saplings planted during 2014-15.
Satelli te  surveillance has been adopted for monitoring reclamation activities of 50 major OCPs, producing 5.0MM 3 (Coal + OB) or more  every year and other OCPs once in three years.
It is evident from satellite surveillance that reclaimed land area has increased by  6.85 sq.Km during 2014 in 50 major OCPs.
Study of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO, Hyderabad in 2013 reveals that the ﬁre area in Jharia Coalﬁelds had  reduced from 8.9 sq Km (as assessed in Master Plan) to 2.0 sq Km after undertaking various methods while implementing the  Master Plan.
6.
Safety – Always a priority   Safety of miners and mines remains a top priority concern for Coal India.
In pursuit of higher production no compromise would be  made on safety facet.
Coal India has a well-deﬁned safety policy to ensure safety in all mines and establishments.
The fatality rate  per million tonne of coal produced has reduced by 30.77% and serious injury rate per million tonne has reduced by 11.63% in  2014 compared to its previous year.
The endeavour is to elevate safety standards radically further, since in this regard there could  be only ‘Zero Accident’ as the goal.
7.
Corporate Social Responsibility   Corporate Social Responsibility apart from improving the quality of lives of people is also to take them along towards the goal of the  company by partnering with them.
While pursuing the enhancement of Coal production, CSR is being undertaken to have inclusive  growth of villagers and affected community.
(i) Coal India and its subsidiaries have spent ` 298.10 Crores in FY ending 2015 on CSR initiatives.

2.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section  134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation  of these standalone ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair view of the  ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows of the Company in  accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Accounting Standards speciﬁed under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule  7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
This responsibility also includes  maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  ﬁnancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
3.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these standalone ﬁnancial  statements based on our audit.
We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and  auditing standards and matters which are required to be included in the audit  report under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing speciﬁed  under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Those Standards require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free from material  misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the amounts and the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
The procedures  selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
Coal India Limited.
A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15078 AUDITOR'S REPORT  MANAGEMENT REPLY In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal ﬁnancial control  relevant to the Company’s preparation of the ﬁnancial statements that give a  true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether  the Company has in place an adequate internal ﬁnancial control system over  ﬁnancial reporting and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
An audit also  includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Company, as well as  evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations  given to us, the aforesaid standalone ﬁnancial statements give the information  required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state  of affairs of the Company as at 31st March, 2015, and its proﬁt and its cash ﬂows  for the year ended on that date.
Emphasis of Matters We draw attention to the following notes:- (a) Note No.
10A (2) regarding non-provision against ﬁxed assets in Dankuni Coal  Complex leased to South Eastern Coalﬁelds Limited (SECL) for lease rent of  Re.1 per annum.
In opinion of the management the nominal income earning is  a temporary policy matter and actual worth of the assets including land is much  higher than the book value and hence no provision is called for.
This is a statement of fact referring to the  notes on accounts no 10A (2) only.
As mentioned by the Audit, referring to  the relevant note, the recoverable value  (actual worth), of the assets of Dankuni  Coal Complex (given on operating lease  to SECL, a 100% subsidiary of CIL on a  nominal rent) is considered much higher  than its WDV.
Hence no provision as  per AS-28 (Accounting Standard on  Impairment) or otherwise is required.
(b) Note No.
11 and 18, dealing with an aggregate investments of ` 8926.42 Crores  and loans & advances of ` 578.55 Crores (Current Account Debit Balances) in  its 100%subsidiaries namely, Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) and Eastern  Coalﬁelds Limited (ECL) have come out of Board for Industrial & Financial  Reconstruction (BIFR).
These subsidiaries are turning around and have started  earning proﬁts.
In the view of changing circumstances, the management is of the  opinion that no writing down or provisioning is required against the erosion in the  value of assets.
This is a statement of fact referring to the  notes on accounts only .
Eastern Coalﬁelds Limited (ECL) & Bharat  Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) are 100%  subsidiary of Coal India Limited.
BCCL had  come out of BIFR during FY 2012-13.
ECL  has also come out of BIFR from Jan 2015.
Both the companies are earning proﬁts  consistently from last few years.
Hence,  the diminution in value of investment is not  considered as permanent in nature and  therefore following the provisions of AS  13 (accounting Standard on Investments),  no writing down or provision is required.
Current account debit balances under  "loans & advances" are also on the same  analogy considered to be recoverable and  hence no provision is required.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 079 AUDITOR'S REPORT  MANAGEMENT REPLY (c) Note 34(i) (c) & (d), Contingent Liability of the accompanying ﬁnancial statements,  which describes the uncertainty related to the outcome of the lawsuits ﬁled and  demands raised against the Company by various parties and Government  authorities; This being a statement of fact calls for no  comments separately.

This is a statement of fact referring to the  notes on accounts no 34(xvii) only.
As mentioned by the Audit, referring to the  relevant note, the effects of The Mines and  Minerals (Development and Regulations)  Amendment Act,2015 have not been  considered in the books of accounts as  the rules have not been notiﬁed yet by  the Central or State government under the  said act.
(e) Pending write off action of certain account balances against which full provision  has been made in the books of accounts; Noted, action is being taken to initiate write  off.
(f) Balances under Long Term Loans and advances of ` 134.78 Crores, Trade  Receivables of ` 9.76 Crores, Other Current assets of ` 199.82 Crores, Trade  Payables of ` 2.28 Crores and Other Current Liabilities of ` 235.14 Crores, have  not been conﬁrmed.
Consequential impact on conﬁrmation/ reconciliation of  such balances, if any is not ascertainable.
Trade receivables are periodically  reconciled on regular basis.
In respect of  trade payables & other current Liabilities,  system for obtaining conﬁrmation is there,  although in most of the cases response  from the creditors are not received.
However, efforts will be taken to increase  the coverage area.
(g) The Independent Directors have not been appointed in the Board of the Company  as per the provisions of Section 149(1) of the Companies Act, 2013.
The matter has been taken up with  Ministry of Coal, Govt.
of India which is  the appointing authority of Independent  Directors .
Our opinion is not qualiﬁed in respect of above matters.

Substantial funds are being earmarked  annually by the Ministry of Coal and CIL R&D Board to carry out research work on the above subjects in above sectors.
2.
Benefits derived as a result of the above R&D  Notable advances have been made through R&D efforts in coal exploration techniques, introduction of mining methods like  “blasting gallery and cable bolting” for recovery of coal in thick seams and shortwall mining at SECL with an output of more th an  1000 T per day being replicated in more panels.
“Controlled blasting” has also been introduced through R&D and is being used  now for removal of overburden rocks and coal in opencast mines as close as to 50 m from surface structures successfully.
More  than 156 Mt of coal has been extracted so far in more than 139 mines by introduction of “Controlled Blasting” which otherwise  would have been remained sterilized.
A quantiﬁed assessment of roof strata called Rock Mass Rating (RMR) developed under R&D is now being used for designing  support in underground mines.
So far over 872 districts in about 310 underground coal mines have been covered.
A number of research projects have yielded considerable gains in the area of land reclamation after mining and utilization of ﬂy  ash.
Humic acid from lignite as a fertilizer in agriculture has shown 35% increase in the yield in case of capsicum, tomato cro ps  and also substantial increase in other crops.
This product has been commercialized and is being used by the farmers in Tamil  Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.
A multi institutional funded (UNDP/GEF, CIL and MoC) demonstration research project on “Coal Bed Methane Recovery and  Commercial Utilization” has been successfully concluded at Moonidih underground project, BCCL with encouraging results.
The gas recovered under this project is almost 98% pure methane, which is being utilized to run gas based generators to supply  electricity to Moonidih mine residential colony.
Signiﬁcant improvement has been achieved in “coking and non-coking coal washing” and “recovery of ﬁne coals”.
Encouraging  results have also been obtained from research related to “combustion techniques” for effective utilization of high-ash coals.
Major  R&D projects on ﬁne coal beneﬁciation are under implementation through CIL R&D funding.
While some research projects have produced tangible impact on the industry directly, there are others, which have strengthened   mine planning, design and technical services required by both operating mines and future mining projects.
A number of research projects have been taken up in the area of environment and ecology to integrate coal mining activities wi th  ecological conservation and hazards due to mining.
The ﬁndings of these research projects have made a signiﬁcant impact on  the industry resulting in the adoption of proper environment control.
A study was carried out to determine the free silica (D-Quartz)  content present in respirable air borne dust in coal mines and after subsequent analysis in the laboratory, a database software   ALPHA-QUARTZ has been developed for various parameters including free silica content and other minerals present in respirable  air borne dust as well as in coal.
To ensure safety of human life and to protect loss of equipment due to collision of dumpers in opencast mines, Dumper Collisio n  Avoidance System (DCAS) has been developed indigenously.
The system is now in operation at KDH opencast mine of Central  Coalﬁelds Limited (CCL).
This three layer system consists of proximity sensors mounted on dumpers on three sides to detect  objects within 10 m range, distance and direction information of dumpers present in the vicinity of 100 m and also positional  information of the dumper through GPRS.
Under the R&D project an efﬁcient energy management pilot study and action plan, a computerized monitoring and reporting  mechanism of energy efﬁciency key performance indicators has been developed.
This system will be helpful in providing all  necessary details about energy (both diesel and electricity) consumption and thereby key performance indicators associated with  each and every process/equipment in use.
Under the S&T grant of Ministry of Coal, Self-advancing goaf edge (mobile) chock type supports have been developed and were  put into ﬁeld trial at Bastacola mine of BCCL.
These self-propelled mobile supports of medium duty (2 x 200 Te.)
have closed and  extended height range of 1.85 to 3.2 metres and can offer support resistance of 71.4 T/ m2.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 095  New areas like application of robotics, safe dragline dump proﬁles for varying geo-mining conditions, construction of quick se tting  stoppings in case of ﬁre in underground mines using expansion foam agent, sustainable livelihood activities on reclaimed opencast  coal mines, development of suitable and cost effective mine void aqua eco-system for promoting ﬁsh culture in abandoned coal  quarries, modeling of airborne dust in opencast mines, design, develop and demonstration of Micro-Grid system for optimization  and control of multiple source of power supply, etc.
are being addressed through on-going research projects with S&T / R&D  funding.
3.
Future Plan of Action:  For enhancing the quantum of research work needed to address the complexity of operations of coal industry and wider involveme nt  of research organizations / academic institutes, efforts are continued to invite research proposals in the areas related to min ing  methods, strata control, and mine safety, etc., for funding under S&T Grant of Ministry of Coal and R&D fund of Coal India Limited.
Future R&D efforts will address areas like liquidation of developed pillar in underground mines, pit and dump slope stability in  opencast mines, hydraulic mining, high wall mining, early warning systems for roof fall prediction and dump & highwall failures ,  CBM from fugitive emissions from opencast mines, in-situ coal gasiﬁcation, coal liquefaction, and development of predictive  models for air quality and pollution etc.
An important research project, Shale gas potentiality evaluation of Damodar basin of India is under implementation with an obj ective  to evaluate Damodar basins of India for their shale gas potentiality through integrated geophysical, geological, geochemical and  petrophysical investigations.
Another research project titled “Coal Bed Methane (CBM) reserves estimation for Indian Coalﬁelds” is under implementation with   an objective to calculate CBM reserve estimate by volumetric method followed by uncertainty analysis by probabilistic method  and generate an accurate geological model of a study area with associated coal seams by 2D/3D seismic survey and acquisition  of conventional surface / subsurface information and validation of the model by drilling core holes.
Another research project has started recently, in which main focus is on post mining land use and livelihood generation to the   community in and around the mine area.
The proposed research study emphasis is sustainable development on creation of  permanent green cover and livelihood creation.
Emphasis has been put on “coal to oil” conversion technology.
The prevailing high prices level of crude and petroleum products   warrants a fresh look at coal liquefaction process.
The rising costs and issues related to adequate and assured supply of oil from  overseas have a signiﬁcant bearing on both the national economy and energy security.
One important project for development  of indigenous catalyst for coal – to - liquid (CTL) is under implementation with an objective to eliminate the dependency on  technology provider for supply of catalysts for future CTL plants likely to be established in India.

A brief outline of the Company’s CSR Policy, including overview of projects or programs proposed to be undertaken and  a reference to the web-link to the CSR policy and projects or programs.
For any corporate citizen Corporate Social Responsibility is as important a function as its business goal and essentially bettering the lives  of the people.
In case of Coal India, its coal deposits occur in places which are densely populated.
Coal mining, as a natural corollary, displaces people  from their original habitat.
It then becomes not merely obligatory but morally binding for Coal India to take care of people affected by its  mining activities.
Coal India believes Corporate Social Responsibility is not just cheque book philanthropy and aligns its CSR activities in a man ner so as  to be beneﬁcial to the people.
The company aims and aspires to impact and improve the quality of lives of affected persons and the  communities in the proximity of its mining areas.
CSR apart from improving the quality of lives of people is also to take them along as partners in inclusive growth towards the goal of the  company.
Coal India is of ﬁrm conviction elevating the living standards of affected people is as important as attaining its business goals.
Policy on CSR CIL has a well deﬁned CSR policy framed on DPE’s guideline and on the Companies Act, 2013.
The policy has CIL Board’s approval.
The budget on CSR is allocated based on 2% on the average Net Proﬁt of the Company during the three immediate preceding ﬁnancial  years or ` 2.00 per tonne of coal produced in the previous year whichever is higher.
Modalities/Mechanism of Implementation of CSR: The underprivileged living in & around the mining areas in different states of India are the major beneﬁciaries covered under CSR  activities of CIL.
CIL being a holding company executes CSR activities throughout the country as well as in the areas which are  beyond  jurisdiction of subsidiary companies.
In respect of subsidiary companies, the CSR policy is operational within 25 KM radius of the projects/mines and areas including  Head  Quarters for which 80% of the budget is allocated.
Balance 20% is spent within the State/States in which the subsidiary compani es  operate.

B) The Company had complied with the requirements of regulatory authorities on capital markets and no penalties/strictures was  imposed against it in the last three years by Stock Exchange or SEBI or any other statutory authority.

C) Whistle Blower Policy: Clause 49 of Listing Agreement, provides that a listed company shall establish a mechanism for direct ors  and employees to report to the management concerns about unethical behavior, actual or suspected fraud or violation of the  company’s code of conduct or ethics policy.
Accordingly the Board of Directors of CIL in its 272nd Board Meeting held on  12th August, 2011 has approved “COAL INDIA WHISTLE BLOWER POLICY 2011” at CIL and its subsidiary companies for  implementation.
CIL had provided ample opportunities to encourage directors and employees to become whistle blowers (Directors and  employees who voluntarily and conﬁdentially want to bring the unethical practices, actual or suspected fraudulent transactions in  the organization to the notice of competent authority for the greater interest of the organization and the nation).
It has also ensured  a very robust mechanism within the same framework to protect them (whistle blowers) from any kind of harm.
It is hereby afﬁrmed  that no personnel has been denied access to the Audit committee.

Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated ﬁnancial  statements based on our audit.
While conducting the audit, we have taken into  account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards and  matters which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions  of the Act and the Rules made there under.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing speciﬁed  under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Those Standards require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free from  material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the amounts and the disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the  auditor considers internal ﬁnancial control relevant to the Holding Company’s  preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair view  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether the Holding  Company has an adequate internal ﬁnancial controls system over ﬁnancial  reporting in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
An audit  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Holding  Company’s Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of  the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained  by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of  the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations  given to us, the aforesaid consolidated ﬁnancial statements give the information  required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view  in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of  the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31st March, 2015, and their  consolidated proﬁt and their consolidated cash ﬂows for the year ended on that  date.

A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15204 4.0 Outlook: The Government of India has taken an ambitious programme of round the clock power supply across the country in the next 5 years .
Creating infrastructure is another thrust area of the Government, which would have a positive bearing in the demand of cement as well as  long products in the steel industry.
Growth in power, cement and steel sectors would bolster growth in the demand of coal.
Congruent to the growth plan of the Government, Coal India Ltd (CIL) has prepared a roadmap to achieve a coal production target of 908  Million Tonnes (Mt) by 2019-20.
In 2015-16, CIL has envisaged a coal production target of 550 Mt with a capital investment of ` 5990.50  Crs.
In addition, CIL has envisaged for investment of ` 4150.00 Crs in different other schemes in 2015-16 like development of railway  infrastructure project, solar power, railway wagon procurement, coal bed methane  (CBM), surface coal gasiﬁcation etc.
Further,  CIL  plans to signiﬁcantly ramp up its investment programme in next ﬁve years.
Market Related Outlook: x  The gap between demand and availability of indigenous coal in the current ﬁscal is estimated at about 210Mt.
XII Plan document  projects that this gap may go up to a level of about 273 Mt by 2021-22.
CIL shall strive to reduce this gap to a large extent b y  increasing domestic production and, if required, by import as mandated in the Presidential Directives.
x  CIL’s thrust on forward e-auctions also provides the end-consumers an opportunity to enter into short-term off-take agreements in  a transparent manner.
In 2014-15, CIL allocated 3.55 Mt through forward e-auctions.
Operations Related Outlook: x  So far, CIL has identiﬁed 106 on-going projects & 67 future/new projects, which together will contribute about 80 % of total co al  production envisaged for 2019-20.
Subsidiaries like SECL, MCL, NCL& CCL will be the major contributors.
x  The expansion program will be managed in a structured manner with the help of IT enabled actions.
The implementation of ERP  solution to enable transparency in operations, maintenance and support functions, is under consideration.
x  The company has recently concluded a study for mechanization and automation level across a substantial number of mines for  identiﬁcation of opportunities in mine planning, exploration, survey, operations and maintenance.
x  CIL is in the process of revising its HR policy for augmenting capacity of training institutes across subsidiaries including II CM.
Several other actions for building human resource capacity are also being contemplated in collaboration with reputed institutions.
x  To support increase in production on sustainable basis, synergic growth in exploration is absolutely necessary.
More use of  hydrostatic drilling, 2D Seismic Survey Technology etc for fast drilling to achieve high rate in exploration has been envisaged.
As  such, CIL will continue to focus on increasing its reserve base in India.
Outlook regarding evolution of the ecosystem: The envisaged coal production target of CIL in coming years will be materialized only by working closely with other stakeholders such as  Indian Railways, State Governments, Regulators, Community and other Market-participants.
CIL expects the following outlook as i t will  play out in the next few months: x  Last mile railway connectivity between growing coal-ﬁelds and arterial lines as well as capacity improvement in the trunk route s  is crucial for evacuation of coal.
There are several railway projects under different stages of planning, engineering, construc tion  in the growing coal-ﬁelds.
Government of Chhattisgarh has entered into JVs with CIL and IRCON to expedite the process with  regard to key railway projects in the State.
Similarly, Government of Odisha & Jharkhand have signed MoUs with CIL & IRCON for  implementation of key railway projects in their States.
x  MoC/CIL is working with Ministry of Power, Railways and other public sector power generation companies to rationalize coal  linkages.
A study regarding this was recently concluded by the Inter-ministerial Task Force.
x  MCL/CIL has formed  a SPV namely Mahanadi Basin Power Limited (MBPL) with 100% share held by MCL with power generation  capacity of 2X800 MW through pit-head Power Plant at Basundhara Coalﬁelds.

7.0 DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Income :- The income of the Company comprises of revenue from operation and other income.
The total revenue for ﬁscal 2015 is ` 80690.71  crore as against ` 77779.40 crore in the previous year registering an increase of 3.74 %.
Major elements of income are discussed below: (`in crore) Particulars FY 2014-15 FY 2013-14 Growth % Gross Sales 95434.76 89216.86 6.97% Less: Levies 23420.14 20406.84 14.77% Net Sales 72014.62 68810.02 4.66% Other Operating Revenue 2105.45 1797.50 17.13% Other Income 6570.64 7171.88 -8.38% Total Income 80690.71 77779.40 3.74% Revenue from Operations: Sale of Coal Sales is presented as gross sales net of various statutory levies comprising royalty, cess on coal, central sales tax, stowing excise duty  and sales tax etc.
The Income from sale of coal is mainly dependent on the pricing and production of coal and distribution thereof.
About 87% of our coal was sold under notiﬁed price to customers having fuel supply agreements (power and other than power both  included) and sale of beneﬁciated coal (washed coal) was around 3% through negotiated price with customers.
About 10% of total coal  sold was through e-auction mechanism, the price determination of which is completely dependent on market dynamics.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 207 Average realization of coal sales through e-auction increased by `268/ton i.e.
to `2450/ton in FY 2014-15 from `2182/ton in FY 2013-14  resulting in increase in sales by `1258 crore.
However, decrease in e-auction volume by 11.10 MT from 58.01 MT in FY 2013-14 to 46.91  MT in FY 2014-15 has resulted in decrease in sales by `2422 crore.
During the year there was no change in the notiﬁed price (except for increase in add-on price in respect of coal produced from Rajmahal  mine of ECL from `300/tonne to `390/tonne w.e.f.
01.04.2014), however average FSA realisation shows some favourable variance owing  to better grade mix realisation.
Off-take during 2014-15 increased to 489.38 million ton from 471.58 million ton in previous year.
Other Operating Revenue: Major portion of other operating revenue is from loading and additional transportation charges recovered from the customers.
Rate of the  loading and transportation charges was increased w.e.f.
17.12.2013, thus during the ﬁscal 2015, company has earned at the increased  rate for the full ﬁnancial year which has contributed to the additional earning of `329.35 crore i.e.
from `1697.61 crore during ﬁscal 2014  to `2026.96 crore during ﬁscal 2015.
Other operating revenue also included Facilitation Charges on Import of Coal (for the services   provided by CIL as a part of fulﬁllment of FSA), and Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works received from Govt.
of India.
Other Income Other income primarily includes (i) interest income from banks, employees and others, (ii) interest on our investments in the 8.5% Tax  Free RBI Power Bonds (which resulted from the securitization of our sundry debtors), (iii) Dividend from mutual funds, (iv) any liquidated  damages or penalty payments by our suppliers and third party contractors.
Other income also includes rental income and any proﬁ t on  sale of assets.
Other income further includes any write back of provisions and liabilities made in previous year.
During the year other income declined by 8.38% from `7171.88 crore in FY 2013-14 to `6570.64 crore in FY 2014-15 largely due to lesser  interest earning on bank deposits by `382.16 crore owing to reduction in average investment in bank deposits resulting out of substantial  outﬂow of fund for high dividend payout in consecutive two years i.e.
FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15.

A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15208 Cost of Material Consumed Cost of material consumed relate to materials used in our coal mining and processing operations, primarily petrol oil and lubri cant  (including diesel), explosives, and timber.
Other consumables used in our coal mining operations include tyres, spares for heav y  earthmoving machineries, other plant and machinery relating to our coal handling plants and beneﬁciation facilities, vehicles, and other  miscellaneous stores and spares.
Consumption of stores and spares increased by `234.39 crore or 3.34%, from `7022.05 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `7256.44 crore in ﬁscal  2015, mainly due to increase in annual weighted diesel price by around 4.22%, increase in volume of composite production from 1136.72  M Cum in FY 2013-14 to 1240.71 M Cum in FY 2014-15 or 9.15% and general inﬂation during the year.
Employee Benefit Expenses Employee beneﬁt expenses include salary, wages and allowances, any provisions relating to Employee beneﬁt, contributions to provident  fund and gratuity, overtime payments, leave encashment, attendance bonus, productivity and performance linked bonus and other  incentives, and other employee beneﬁts.
Employees remuneration and beneﬁts, which represents the largest component of our expenditure, increased by `1959.72 crore, or  7.02%, from `27914.40 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `29874.12 crore in ﬁscal 2015.
While contribution to Provident/Pension fund is expensed at deﬁned contribution basis, some other beneﬁts namely Gratuity, Leav e  Encashment etc.
are provided as per deﬁned beneﬁt plan on the basis of their actuarial valuation at the end of the reporting pe riod.
During the year, actuarial valuation towards Gratuity, Leave Encashment and some other post retirement employee beneﬁts have be en  increased owing to the fall in the yield of the secured Govt.
bond (of appropriate tenure linked to the average service life re maining for  the employees) which is applied to arrive at the present value for such liability, i.e.
to bridge the mismatch in earning of the asset against  such liability.
The impact of such actuarial valuation is `955.17 crore.
Ex-gratia paid during the year to non-executive employees was increased to `40,000/- per employee as compared to `31,500/- per  employee in previous year resulting in additional cost of `293.06 crore.
Other increase in salary is due to annual normal increment in salary & DA, which however is offset to some extent by decrease i n  employees due to retirement.
Output per manshift (OMS) during 2014-15 improved to 6.20 tonnes per manshift from 5.62 tonnes per manshift of previous year Power and Fuel Power and fuel represents cost of electricity consumed in our operations, including electricity purchased from external sources and cost  of internal power generation relating to diesel generator sets.
Power and fuel expenses was `2347.28 crore in FY 2014-15 as against `2282.23 crore during FY 2013-14.The higher amount of power  & fuel expenses in current year FY 2014-15 was due to increase in consumption due to higher production as well as marginal incr ease  in power tariff.
Corporate Social Responsibility Expenses With the implementation of new Companies Act 2013, effective from ﬁscal 2015, expenditure on CSR are guided by the provisions of  Companies Act.
During the year total expenditure on CSR was `298.10 crore as against `409.37 crore during ﬁscal 2014.
During ﬁscal  2014 expenses on CSR was higher owing to contribution made on account of natural disasters in Odisha and Uttaranchal.
Contractual Expenses/ Repairs Contractual charges primarily consist of transportation charges for coal, sand and materials carried out through third party contractors,  contractor expenses relating to wagon loading operations, hiring charges for plant and machinery and heavy earthmoving machiner y  representing cost of coal extraction and overburden removal activities outsourced to third party contractors, and other miscell aneous  works carried out through third party contractors such as for haul road maintenance at mines and temporary lighting.
Repairs consist of  cost of repair and maintenance of plant and machinery relating to our operations, rehabilitation of heavy earthmoving machinery , ofﬁce  equipment, vehicles and other miscellaneous assets.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014-15 209 Contractual Expenses/Repairs increased by `1822.64 crore, or 23.33%, from `7812.71 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `9635.35 crore in ﬁscal  2015.
Contractual Expenses/Repairs has increased mainly because of increased volume of composite production which is 9.15%,  impact for increase in wages of contractual workers and also due to rise in annual weighted diesel price by about 4.22% both of which  are recovered by the contractors from the company through escalation clause.
Finance Costs Finance costs decreased by `50.68 crore, or 87.38%, from `58.00 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `7.32 crore in ﬁscal 2015 due to prepayment of  IBRD and JBIC loans on 05.11.2013 and 06.12.2013 respectively.
Overburden Removal Adjustment In open cast mines, with rated capacity of one million tons per annum and above, the cost of overburden removal expenses is charged  on technically evaluated average ratio (coal: overburden) at each mine with due adjustment for advance stripping and ratio vari ance  account after the mines are brought to revenue.
The net of balances of advance stripping and ratio variance at the end of the r elevant  period is shown as cost of removal of overburden under the head current assets or current liabilities, as applicable.
Overburden Removal Adjustment increased by `540.14 crore, or 16.43%, from `3286.56 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `3826.70 crore in ﬁscal  2015.
Although the overall OB removal for CIL as a whole increased from 808.40 M cum in FY 2013-14 to 889.80 M cum in FY 2014-15, in  a few subsidiaries particularly in MCL, the OB removal decreased by 7.09% from 96.03 M cum in FY 2013-14 to 89.22 M cum in FY 2014- 15 despite the production increase by 9.91% from 110.44 MT in FY 2013-14 to 121.38 MT in FY 2014-15.
This resulted in a very adverse  stripping ratio and required high provision for OBR.
Such OBR provision in case of MCL increased by `713.20 crore in FY 2014-15.
Depreciation/ Impairment Depreciation on ﬁxed assets is provided on straight line method at the rates and manner speciﬁed in Schedule II of the Companies  Act 2013 except otherwise for those assets for which technically evaluated higher rate of depreciation has been considered as a   policy.
Impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying amount of an asset is in excess of its recoverable amount and the s ame is  recognized as an expense in the statement of proﬁt and loss and carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amou nt.
Reversal of impairment losses recognized in prior years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment losses reco gnized  for the asset no longer exist or have decreased.
Depreciation/ Impairment increased by `323.39 crore, or 16.20 %, from `1996.41 crore in ﬁscal 2014 to `2319.80 crore in ﬁscal 2015,  owing to application of new rates as per Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013.
Provision/write-off Provisions/write-off include any provisions for doubtful debts and advances, provisions for unmoved/obsolete stores and spares inventory,  provisions relating to impairment of assets, and any other miscellaneous provisions..
