18601212155  Coal India Limited.
A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16008 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Friends, I am delighted to welcome you to the 42 nd Annual General Meeting of Coal India Limited.
The Directors’ Report and the Financial  Statement for the year ended 31st March, 2016 together with the Report of Statutory Auditors and report of Comptroller & Auditor General  of India are already with you.
1.
Importance of coal and Coal India Limited  As our country is expanding industrially and economically so are its energy needs.
In India, coal is the answer to escalating energy  demand.
The country’s planners, however, are alternately exploring to shift from being a largely fossil driven energy economy t o  one that is powered by clean and renewable form, especially solar.
But till such time other forms of energy begin to contribute   significantly, coal is and shall remain the most dominant energy fuel in providing energy security to the country.
What makes coal  such a preferred energy fuel is, its abundance, availability and affordability.
The estimated geological resource of Indian coa l  stood at 306.59 Billion Tonnes as of 1st April, 2015.
Around 72% of the entire power generated in the country is coal based.
Against this backdrop, you will be proud to know that your company, Coal India Limited spearheads the country’s coal productio n,  and produces over 84% of the country’s entire coal output.
It is Coal India which virtually fuels and empowers the power sector in  the country.
2.
Accomplishments 2015-16  For the first time, Coal India’s production and off-take have exceeded Half-a-Billion Tonne mark, an indication that the company is  on its pursuit of 1 Billion Tonne production by 2019-20.
During FY 2015-16 Coal India as a whole recorded coal production of 538.75 Million Tonnes (MTs).
You will be pleased to know  that the company has stepped into a higher growth trajectory registering nearly 44.51 MTs increase in coal production during FY   2016 - the highest ever incremental increase in a single financial year since the inception of the company.
Raw coal off-take during FY 2016 was 534.50 MTs, an increase of 45.11 MTs on a year-on-year comparison.
As in production, all  subsidiary companies of Coal India have registered positive growth in off-take.
Power Utilities of the country, the major coal consuming sector, during FY 2016 were supplied with 408.75 MTs of coal against  385.39 MTs in previous fiscal, registering a growth of 6.1% and achieving 95% of the target.
Coal supplies to NTPC (Including the  NTPC JV) registered a materialization level of 90%.
Other positives:  1) On the financial front, you will be pleased to know that, Coal India for the first time had surpassed the magical figure of  `1  Lakh Crores in Gross Sales recording Gross Sales of `1,08,150.03 Crores during 2015-16.
2) Not a single power-utility was in a critical or super-critical condition for want of coal.
3) Due to the improved despatch and better quality of coal, there was a marked decline in import of non-coking coal of 17.7  MT during FY 2016, resulting in substantial saving in foreign exchange.
4) Significantly the Over Burden Removal (OBR), an important performance criterion in exposing coal seam for future mining,  took a quantum leap during FY16 registering a steep growth of 29.60%.
This is more than three-fold increase on a year-on- year comparison.
OBR also improves the mine geometry and makes mines safer to operate.
Coal India had surpassed the  target of 1031 Million Cubic Metres, in OBR, more than a month ahead of the closure of the fiscal on 24th February 2016 itself  achieving an actual of 1148.908 Million Cubic Metres which is 111% of target satisfaction.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 009  5) You may be happy to note that contrary to the popularly held convention that coal mine areas are the places to keep away  from, Western Coalfields Limited, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited started an eco-friendly mine tourism which has become  highly popular.
The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme aired on 27th March,2016 made a  special mention of this.
Financial Performance:  Coal India is one the highest contributors to the government ex-chequer in the country both- federal and state governments.
Coal  India paid a corporate tax of `7,012.35 Crores to Government of India in FY 2016.
Coal India and its subsidiaries have also paid/adjusted ` 29,084.11 Crores towards Royalty, Cess, VAT and other levies.
During 2015-16, Coal India as a whole earned pre-tax profit of ` 21,589.09 Crores and a Profit After Tax of ` 14,274.33 Crores.
Coal India had paid an interim dividend of `27.40 per share.
The total outgo from the Company was `17,306.84 Crores of which  Government of India holding 79.649% of company’s shares received `13,784.86 Crores.
3.
Strategies for Growth  Coal India is faced with meeting challenging targets in the years ahead.
Going forward, in order to meet the production targets,  Coal India needs to step up to a double digit growth rate from that of around 9% achieved during FY 2016.
It is with a feeling of  satisfaction, I share with you that during the first four months of FY 2017, Coal India’s production growth was more than 6 mil lion  tonnes over the same period last year.
To sustain the growth momentum in its production and off-take in the future, Coal India has formulated the following multi-pro nged  strategies.
(i) Critical Railway Links - Collaboration with State Governments & Railways   There are a few important coalfields in the country which have huge production potential but are without rail linkages for  evacuation of coal produced.
Among these, 3 rail lines linked to CCL (Jharkhand), MCL (Odisha) and SECL (Chhattisgarh)  are critical and expected to play a key role in the evacuation of coal.
For speedy commissioning and implementation of these critical rail lines, Joint Venture companies have been formed in  a tripartite partnership arrangement between State Nodal Agencies, respective CIL subsidiary companies and IRCON  synergizing the efforts.
(ii) Technology Development   A. Geology    In geological exploration, hydrostatic drilling is the most state-of-the art technology.
CMPDIL has deployed twelve  hydrostatic drills for exploration of coal by replacing the conventional mechanical drills.
We plan to procure seven  more hydrostatic drills in 2016-17.
These drills are high-tech and improves efficiency of operation significantly to  achieve higher productivity.
In 2015-16, the tungsten carbide inserts of Crab Bits were replaced with PCD inserts which enabled higher penetration  rate and bit life in Motur formation of WCL.
To improve boreholes stability, mud mixer assembly will be introduced  within the hydraulic system of mechanical drills for continuous mixing of drilling fluid.
Phenomenal development of technology applied in Geophysical Survey has also been taken place.
In 2015-16, five  Geophysical Loggers were available.
It is planned to expand the application of Geophysical Logging by increasing  the strength to ten by 2016-17.
This equipment is used for delineation of different formations and in-situ characteristics  in a borehole at different depth.
Five Resistivity Imaging System were introduced in 2015-16.
In 2016-17, one more will be procured for sub-surface  geological investigation.
Coal India Limited.
A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16010    We proposed to introduce a new technology by utilizing Ground Probing Radar system (GPR) for shallow depth  investigation with high precision.
It is also intended to introduce Gravity Survey equipment for high depth basement  studies of coalfields.
Further, it is planned to replace manual hammering technique with high power electro-mechanical  vibrating source for generating acoustic wave (e.g.
Vibroseis) for greater depth of geological investigation in 2D/3D  Seismic Survey.
B. Opencast Mining    The latest version of Geovia Minex Software has been put to use which facilitates state-of-the-art resource planning  through pit design, pit optimization, scheduling of resources and dumps etc.
Laser Scanners as TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner) for measurement of overburden and mine face, that are in use,  entails significantly higher accuracy levels and speed.
Further, it is also proposed to use drones with laser scanner  for survey purpose.
A wide variance of HEMM size have been provisioned in coal mining projects.
Higher size HEMM viz.
Electric Rope  Shovels of 42 Cum together with Dump Trucks of 240 T have been introduced in CIL mines.
Surface Miners of  varying sizes are being used & proposed for new mines, wherever suitable.
Dozers fitted with rippers are also being  proposed for band and thin seam removal in many of the projects.
For better management and control of HEMM fleet,  GPS based truck dispatch system has been introduced in large OC mines.
The use of silos with rapid loading system in large mines have been stepped up for faster and environment friendly  loading in the sidings.
GPS and GPRS technology are used for vehicle tracking system for better surveillance.
C. Underground Technology    In underground mines, persistent efforts are being made to embark upon the use of mass production technologies,  wherever the geo-technical conditions permit.
During the year 2015-16, a power support long-wall set having planned  production capacity of 0.7 Mty has been installed in Moonidih XVI seam and another long-wall set for Jhanjra mine  (having planned production capacity of 1.7 Mty) is under installation.
The long-wall set at Moonidih commenced  operation during the year.
Four continuous miners have been added and put into operation during the year in three more mines of CIL with total  planned capacity of 1.84 Mty.
Deployment of more numbers of continuous miners are expected in the coming years  to enable enhancement of production & productivity from underground mines.
In 2015-16, the first ever diesel operated Free Steered Vehicle (FSV) has been introduced in Jhanjra mine of ECL  for transportation of men and material.
Additionally, eight (8) numbers of man-riding system has been installed  in arduous and long distant mines of CIL which plays a significant role in enhancing safety and productivity in  underground mines.
It is envisaged to install more man riding systems in CIL mines in the near future.
(iii) Role of HR   Coal India is largely man-power intensive industry.
Human Resource has to play an active role if Coal India has to achieve  the challenging targets of the future.
Coal India had identified various areas that would supplement its efforts in invigorating  its manpower and is charting out a plan for recruiting multi-disciplinary professionals, skill upgradation of existing employees  and identifying key areas of improvement.
Coal India had also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) to  promote special education and employment enhancing vocational skills.
The beneficiaries would also include Project  Affected Persons (PAPs).The objective is to promote special education and employment enhancing vocational skills  especially among children, women, elderly, and the differently abled.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 011 4.
Other Improvement Areas  (i)  Coal Washing - A step towards Quality improvement   At present, Coal India has a total coal washing capacity of 36.8 million tonnes per year (MTY) through its 15 existing  washeries, of which 12 are coking and 3 non coking with 23.30 MTY and 13.50 MTY capacities respectively.
In addition, Coal India plans to set up further 15 washeries with state-of-the-art and innovative technologies in coal  beneficiation with an aggregate throughput capacity of 112.6 MTY.
Out of these, 6 are coking coal washeries, with a  cumulative capacity of 18.6 MTY, and the rest 9 are non-coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 94 MTY.
(ii)  System Improvements   Ease of doing business:E-procurement universalized and more effectively implemented.
ERP as a route towards  organisational synergy will also be fast tracked.
Coal India has already adopted a host of ICT initiatives to make internal processes IT driven and to enhance all round  system efficiency and transparency to improve employee, customer and vendors' satisfaction.

5.
Green Initiatives  Coal India is conscious of its commitment towards the environment and its ecosystem.
The Company strives to give back to  Nature, to the best extent possible, what has been pried away from her.
The Company does this by taking appropriate measures  to mitigate the impact of mining and associated activities in accordance with EIA / EMP of each project.
Coal India has created a green wealth of about 92.35 million trees covering an area over 36,896.26 Ha till March 2016.
Of this ,  1.68 million trees have been planted over 719 Hectares (Ha) in FY 2016.
Satellite surveillance has been adopted for monitoring  reclamation activities of 50 major OCPs, producing 5.0MM3 (Coal + OB) or more every year and for other OCPs once in three  years.
It is evident from satellite surveillance that reclaimed land area has increased by 9.63 Sq.Km during FY 2016 in 50 major  OCPs w.r.t FY 2015.
Study of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO, Hyderabad in 2013 revealed that the fire area in Jharia Coalfields had  reduced from 8.9 Sq.
Km (as assessed in Master Plan) to 2.18 Sq.
Km after undertaking various methods while implementing the  Master Plan.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 013 6.
Safety – Always a priority  Safety of miners and mines remains a top priority concern for Coal India.
In pursuit of higher production, no compromise would  be  made on safety front.
Safety of miners and mines override any other priority.
Coal India has a well-defined safety policy to ensure  safety in all mines and establishments.
There are many preventive measures against accidents and these are being followed  attentively.
Safety can be increased with improved training, skill development and approaching the issue in a scientific and holistic  manner.
So, safety personnel are exposed to the best practices internationally and are sent for training abroad.
We are also  inculcating and monitoring a safety culture and attitude.
The fatality rate per million tonne of coal produced has reduced by 22.2%  and serious injury rate per million tonne has reduced by 28.9% in 2015 compared to its previous year.
The endeavour is to elevate  safety standards radically further, since in this regard there could be only ‘Zero Accident’ as the goal.
7.
Corporate Social Responsibility  Apart from improving the quality of lives of people, Coal India’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives also take them along  towards the company’s goal by partnering with them.
While pursuing the enhancement of Coal production, CSR is being undertaken  for inclusive growth of villagers and the nearby affected communities.
(i)  During the year total expenditure on CSR in pursuance to Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 was ` 1076.07 crore and  further ` 6.00 crore was towards donation to Nepal Earthquake relief fund totalling to ` 1082.07 crore as against ` 298.10  crore during FY 2014-15  (ii)  Coal India has taken an initiative towards Swachh Vidyalay Abhiyaan by constructing 53,412 toilets.
A total of ` 820.44  Crores has been spent on the construction of these toilets by 31st March’2016.
(iii)  In a tie-up with Tata Medical Centre (TMC), Coal India has sanctioned ` 41.11 Crores for the construction of "Premashraya",  a ten storied building which provides housing facilities for the economically weak and outstation patients visiting TMC for  treatment.

COAL MARKETING 3.1  (a)  Off-take of Raw Coal  Off-take of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend  and reached 534.496 million tonnes for fiscal ended March  2016, surpassing previous highest figure of 489.377 million  tonnes achieved during the last year, i.e., an increase of 9.2 %  over the last year.
The overall raw coal off-take achieved  was 97.2 % of the Annual Action Plan Target.
In the year  2015-16, all coal companies barring NEC could outperform  their achievement of last year.
BCCL, NCL & SECL, in  addition, had also exceeded their target.
Company-wise target vis-à-vis actual off-take for 2015-16  and 2014-15 are shown under Annexure 6.
Offtake could have been more, but for the following  reasons:  SECL: Less demand of higher grades of Korea Rewa coal.
ECL: Unprecedented heavy rain caused water logging in  OCPs during monsoon affected production, transportation  and despatch.
Less Demand of higher grades coal of  Raniganj & financial constraint of WBPDCL / DVC and  regulated lifting by NTPC-Farakka / Kahalgaon TPP affected  loading & off-take.
CCL: Intermittent Law & Order problem, inadequate  demand and regulation in intake by up-country power  stations of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh had affected  despatch.
Logistics bottleneck at Amrapali-Magadh Mines  had also come in the way of augmenting off-take.
WCL: Comfortable coal stock at power stations led to  regulated lifting.
TPPs were particularly reluctant to take  coal from Cost Plus Sources.
MCL:  Sporadic incidence of law and order problem &  less supply of wagons against their indents affected MCL  despatch.
Less movement through MGR mode also affected  overall dispatch.
Initiatives taken for enhancing off-take are as under:  t 3FHVMBSDPPSEJOBUJPOXJUI3BJMXBZ#PBSEUPPQUJNJ[F use of logistics resources available in the subsidiary  coal companies, analyzing inputs of the subsidiaries  to identify alternate source for coal movement  wherever and whenever required to achieve  overall sectoral targets and mitigating critical fuel  requirement of consuming sectors, particularly  power stations.

During the year 2015- 16, CMPDI has prepared a total of 16 Form-I and formulated  34 Draft EIA/EMPs.
23 environmental clearances were also  obtained from MoEF for different Projects/Group of Mines,  Washeries and Sand Mine Project of CIL during the year  2015-16.
15.2 Pollution Control Measures and their Efficacy  Coal India has been playing a proactive role in environment  protection so as to ensure that its mining operations are  carried out in an environmentally compatible manner.
Pollution control measures are taken concurrently with  mining operations for maintaining acceptable levels of  major physical attributes of environment namely air, water,  hydrogeology, noise, land & nearby population.
(A) Air Pollution Control Measures:  Dust being generated during drilling, blasting, loading,   transportation of coal for which Coal India Ltd. takes various  initiatives to mitigate the same based on the Environmental  Management Plans (EMP) already prepared before  commencement /enhancement of production from coal  mines.
This EMP is prepared after assessing the impact on  existing environment and forest due to coal mining projects  through Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study of  each project.
The air pollution control measures are as  follows:  t 4VJUBCMFXBUFSTQSBZJOHTZTUFNTGPSBSSFTUJOHGVHJUJWF dust in roads, washeries, CHPs, Feeder Breakers,  Crushers, coal transfer points and coal stock areas  are being installed.
Mist spray systems have been  introduced along conveyor routes, transfer points  and on bunkers.
Mobile water sprinkling has been  provided in all the haul roads of OC mines.
In  addition to these, the projects are enhancing the  water sprinkling through engagement of contractual  water tankers.
Automatic sprinklers have also been  installed in CHPs.
Besides these, following steps are  taken:  a) Mobile sprinklers have been deployed along haul  roads so as to control dust generated by truck  movement and dumpers.
b) Optimum loading of coal trucks to avoid spillage on  roads.
c) Covering of coal trucks by tarpaulin is a practice  being followed to avoid spillage of materials during  transport.
d) Blacktopping, strengthening of coal transportation  roads are regularly and scientifically done.
e) Plantation in the mining activity areas along roads  to create green belts in and around the mines.
Plantation along avenues and around mines are also  being carried out.
f) Switching to eco-friendly mode of transport: In order to  reduce the dust pollution due to road transportation,   ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 055 eco-friendly measures are being adopted.
Coal to  thermal power stations who consume more than 80%  of thermal coal, is transported by rail / series of belt  conveyors to thermal power stations & rail heads  are constructed to make rail head available nearer  to mine to reduce road transportation.
CIL have  constructed / are constructing integrated CHP for  rapid loading wagon and trucks.
g) Covered conveyors are also adopted for  transportation of coal to thermal power plant in an  environment friendly way in some of the mines.
The  sides of CHPs are also covered by side cladding with  GI Sheet to control pollution at source.
h) In order to prevent dust at source itself, use of  dust extractors / wet drilling systems are being  undertaken.
i) Controlled blasting / habitation away from the mines  have been introduced as far as possible.
j) Adoption of modern technologies like Surface Miners  at different subsidiaries of CIL, which generates  lesser air borne pollution for carrying out mining  activities as compared to conventional methods as  drilling, blasting & use of explosives are eliminated.
During the year 2015-16, CIL has produced about  44% (234.652 M Tes) of its production from open  cast mines through Surface miners.
Continuous  miners contributed about 3.333 M Tes of production  from underground mines.
k) Ambient air quality in and around the mine site is  being monitored fortnightly.
There are required  numbers of ambient air quality monitoring stations,  as stipulated in environmental rules and regulations  which are being monitored on fortnightly basis as per  Environment (Protection) Act, 2006, and reports are  regularly submitted to SPCBs and MOEF.
l) Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations  (CAAQMS) are installed / being installed in large  mines of CIL.Continuous Ambient Air Quality  Monitoring Stations have been installed at 4 locations  in SECL.
CAAQMSs are under process of installation  at locations 3 in BCCL, 1 in WCL & 10 in NCL.
CIL  has agreed to install 16 CAAQMS in the different  cities of country as decided by CPCB.
(B) Mine Water Management:  Water which pumped out from the underground and  opencast mines are contaminated with suspended particles.
Some small quantity of water being contaminated during  washing and cleaning of HEMM.
CIL also takes initiative by  treating these water.
The treated water is being supplied  to the local villages after mine consumption, Quality of the  final effluent is monitored in terms of the relevant Indian  standards.
(C)  Noise Pollution Control Measures:  For control of noise pollution, following measures are  adopted:  i) Proper maintenance of equipment to minimize  vibration.
ii) Green belt provided around the mine as well as  residential area.
iii) Controlled Blasting & blasting in only day time.
iv)  Use of Surface Miner, Continuous Miner & High Wall  mining which extract coal without blasting.
iv) Ear Muff or Ear Plugs provided to Workers at highly  noisy areas.
(D) Land Reclamation:  Reclamation of the mined out areas and external OB dumps  is a major environmental mitigatory activity taken up by  Coal India Ltd.
In all new mines, reclamation of mined out  areas being done as per the Environmental Management  Plan approved by MoEF and back filling of the OB material  in the mine voids is a part of the mining operation cycle.
Topsoil preservation, storing and use in the plantation areas  of the reclaimed areas are being done in the opencast  mines wherever necessary.
Concurrent reclamation and  rehabilitation of mined out areas (subject to technical  feasibility as per geo-mining conditions) are taken for gainful  land use.
Opencast mines are filled up with overburden  extracted during the process of extraction of coal and after  technical reclamation is completed, plantation is carried out  which is termed as biological reclamation.
t  Eco-restoration: For effective Bio- reclamation of  disturbed land, scientific studies are carried out to  select suitable species of plants for each coalfield  and sustainable sequence of reclamation from grass  to shrubs to trees.
Forest Research Institute (FRI)  have been engaged by CIL for sharing their expertise  in the field of eco-restoration in the reclaimed areas.
ECO restoration site developed in Damoda, Tetulmari  of BCCL, with technical guidance of FRI. t  Eco-park in Reclaimed land:  Eco Parks have been  developed in many of the mined out areas of CIL  (Gunjan Park of ECL, Ananya Vatika of SECL, Nigahi   Coal India Limited.
A Maharatna Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16056 of NCL, Sauner of WCL etc.).
t  Monitoring of Reclamation:  CIL introduced state- of-the-art Satellite Surveillance to monitor land  reclamation and restoration for all opencast projects.
The land reclamation and rehabilitation operations  are being monitored by Satellite Surveillance.
50  major OCPs excavating more than 5 MM3 (Coal+OB)  per annum are being monitored every year while  remaining OCPs excavating less than 5 MM³  (Coal+OB) per annum are being monitored every 3rd  year.
This gives a clear picture of reclamation, which  otherwise is difficult to accurately estimate.
t  Mine Closer Plan:  Mine closure plan is an integral  part of the project report prepared by CMPDIL for  Coal mines after exhaustion of reserves of a mine.
This progressive mine closure plan also forms a  part of the EIA/EMP prepared and submitted to  MOEF for Environmental Clearance.
The progressive  reclamation of mined out areas are inbuilt in the  project cost and is implemented accordingly.
After  exhaustion of reserves, statutory obligations in  respect of closure are also followed.
CIL is practicing  mine closure very effectively .CIL is committed for  restoration of abandoned / mined out areas in a  socially acceptable & environment friendly manner.
(E) Strive for continual improvement in environmental  performance by setting targets, measuring progress  and taking corrective action.
CIL has engaged Indian Council of Forestry Research &  Education (ICFRE), Dehradun for Environmental Audit of 20  OC Mines of CIL which is intended for third party inspection,  verification of the existing levels of pollution vis-a-vis the laid  down standards and to delineate the compliance status of  major projects in addition to the inspection carried out by  the statutory authorities like CPCB/SPCB etc.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were ope rating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the  timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (t he  “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies  Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and,  both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply wi th  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial co ntrols  over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depen d on  the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due  to fraud  or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on t he  Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with general ly accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures t hat (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositio ns of the  assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being  made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control  over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the poli cies  or procedures may deteriorate.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 089 Opinion According to the information and explanations given to us, and based on our audit, in our opinion, the Company has generally maintained,  in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting and such internal financial controls  over financial  reporting were generally operating effectively as of March 31, 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting cri teria  established by the Company considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the “Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls over Financial Reporting” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
However certain areas need further  improvement in designing the “Documentation on Internal Financial Controls” by way of identifying the significant account balan ces  including the fixed assets accounting, incorporating the process flow by which the aforesaid transactions are initiated, author ized,  processed, recorded, and reported at departmental level, related accounting records, supporting informations, procedure how the   system is integrated to departments to capture the transactions that related to financial statements and events/conditions othe r than  the transactions that are significant to the financial statements so as to fulfill objectives of control criteria established a t Company,  introduction of Integrated ERP system of accounting so that financial reporting process can be further improved especially in c ase of  compilation of information or data for financial reporting process.

Substantial funds are being earmarked  annually by the Ministry of Coal and CIL R&D Board to carry out research work on the above subjects in above sectors.
2.
Benefits derived as a result of the above R&D  Notable advances have been made through R&D efforts in coal exploration techniques, introduction of mining methods like  “blasting gallery and cable bolting” for recovery of coal in thick seams and shortwall mining at SECL with an output of more th an  1000T per day being replicated in more panels.
“Controlled blasting” has also been introduced through R&D and is being used  now for removal of overburden rocks and coal in opencast mines as close as to 50m from surface structures successfully.
More  than 182 Mt of coal so far has been extracted in more than 162 mines by introduction of “Controlled Blasting” which otherwise  would have been remained sterilized.
A quantified assessment of roof strata called Rock Mass Rating (RMR) developed under R&D is now being used for designing  support in underground mines.
So far, over 884 districts in about 310 underground coal mines have been covered.
A number of research projects have yielded considerable gains in the area of land reclamation after mining and utilization of fly  ash.
Humic acid from lignite as a fertilizer in agriculture has shown 35% increase of yield in case of capsicum, tomato crops a nd  also substantial increase in other crops.
This product has been commercialized and is being used by the farmers in Tamil Nadu,  Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.
A multi institutional funded (UNDP/GEF, CIL and MoC) demonstration research project on “Coal Bed Methane Recovery and  Commercial Utilization” has successfully concluded at Moonidih underground project, BCCL with encouraging results.
The gas  recovered under this project is almost 98% pure methane, which is being utilized to run gas based generators to supply electricity  to Moonidih mine residential colony.
Significant improvement has been achieved in both “coking and non-coking coal washing” and “recovery of fine coals”.
Encouraging results have also been obtained from research related to “combustion techniques” for effective utilization of high-ash  coals.
Major R&D projects on fine coal beneficiation are under implementation through CIL R&D funding.
While some research projects have produced tangible impact on the industry directly, there are others, which have strengthened   mine planning, design and technical services required by both operating mines and future mining projects.
A number of research projects has been taken up in the area of environment and ecology to integrate coal mining activities wit h  ecological conservation and hazards due to mining.
The findings of these research projects have made a significant impact on  the industry resulting in the adoption of proper environment control.
A study was carried on to determine the free silica (䃐-Quartz)  content present in respirable air borne dust in coal mines and after subsequent analysis in the laboratory, a database software   ALPHA-QUARTZ have been developed for various parameters including free silica content and other minerals present in respirable  air borne dust as well as in coal.
To ensure the safety of human life and to protect loss of equipment due to collision of dumpers in opencast mines, Dumper  Collision Avoidance System (DCAS) has been developed indigenously.
The system is now in operation at KDH opencast mine  of Central coalfields Limited (CCL).
This three-layer system consists of proximity sensors mounted on dumpers on three sides to  detect objects within 10m range, distance and direction information of dumpers present in the vicinity of 100m and also positional  information of the dumper through GPRS.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 147  Under the S&T grant of Ministry of Coal, Self-advancing goaf edge (mobile) chock type supports have been developed and were  put into field trial at Bastacola mine of BCCL.
These self-propelled mobile supports of medium duty (2 x 200 Te.)
have closed and  extended height range of 1.85 to 3.2 m and can offer support resistance of 71.4 T/ m2.
Under an R&D project, the solar photovoltaic plant has been commissioned on the roof tops of CMPDI office buildings.
The  total installed capacity of the plant is around 191kW, which is at present generating 30% of total installed capacity.
Two type s of  technologies, one with string inverter and another with micro inverter have been adopted in installing the plant.
Under this project,  conventional grid (utility supply) clubbed with solar PV system and DG sets through grid interactive inverters to feed to internal grid  (CMPDI) whenever utility grid (JSEB) supply is not available.

In underground mining,  Mass  Production Technology has been introduced in a number of mines.
Continuous Miner Technology has been introduced in three  mines of SECL in the last fiscal apart from seven mines where the same is under operation.
Long-wall mining has been started in  Moonidih mine of BCCL.
So far as absorption of this technology is concerned, it may be said that from operational point of view ,  Mass Production Technology is fully absorbed.
However, from services and spares point of view, the company is still dependent  on the service provider, since such equipment are not yet manufactured in the country and also sufficient number of skilled  manpower trained in such category is not available for maintenance of such equipment.
For the first time in India, Free Steered  Vehicles for transportation of men and materials in underground have been introduced in Jhanjhra mine of ECL.
Other mode of  man-riding system has been commissioned to reduce arduous walking of the miners in several other extensive mines.
Biometric  Attendance System has been started in mines for eliminating the manual interventions as well as reducing the requirement of  additional manpower.
Quick setting stoppings have been constructed in case of fire in underground mines using expansion foam  agent.
The latest version of Geo via Minex software for planning of opencast mines has been introduced.
This provides best resource  planning through pit design, pit optimization, scheduling of resources and dumps etc.
Surface Miners in several opencast mines  have been introduced to eliminate drilling and blasting and also for facilitating selective mining.
GPRS based tracking of coal  transporting vehicles have been introduced to prevent theft and pilferage of coal.
RFID based In-Motion Road Weighbridges  has ensured Real Time transmission of coal weighment data to the Central Server.
This has reduced the chances of fudging of  coal production figures on day to day basis.
For monitoring of coal quality, quantity and loading time closely, CIL has introduced  E-surveillance by installation of CCTV, IP-cameras and control rooms in most of the mines thereby avoiding demurrage charges to  the company.
Coalnet system with different modules and integration of weighbridges through LAN/WAN connection have been introduced.
Electronic procurement by the use of ICT has not only facilitates procurement process for acquisition of goods, works and services  in various activities but also enhance the goodwill of the company.
Through the adoption of E-procurement and Auto Refund of EMDs, CIL has achieved in reducing complaint regarding delay in  refund of EMDs to unsuccessful Bidders.
As a result, the Bidders participation has gone up in the tendering process.
Hydrostatic drills with PCD bits for enhancing the productivity of exploratory drills have been introduced.
A project has been  taken  up in association with NGRI, Hyderabad on “3-D Seismic survey for coal in Belpahar sector of IB valley CF” .
The primary  objective is to have exposure in identifying lay and deposition of coal seams in the surveyed area.
A R&D project based on Radio-metric sorting technique which uses X-Ray for separation of impurities from coal, is currently un der  implementation in Madhuband washery, BCCL.
The project aims at developing a demonstration plant for dry deshaling of coal  based on modified radiometric detection and pneumatic removal technology.
The project is likely to be commissioned in 2016.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 149 (ii)  Benefits derived out of technological initiatives undertaken:  With the introduction of Mass Production Technology in more number of mines of CIL, fully sized coal is available and safety  standard has increased.
Introduction of Free Steered Vehicles and other mode of Man riding Systems has definitely reduced the  travelling time and comfort of the workmen, thereby improving the productivity.
Introduction of Biometric Attendance System has  eliminated the malpractices of marking false/proxy attendance and also ensured full time working hours of the workmen thereby  improving the overall performance of the company.
The system has also been integrated with Pay Roll System and as such,  requirement of clerical staff has also been minimized.
Quick setting stoppings using expansion of foam agent could be built  comfortably with less man-hours.
(a) Over the years, most optimum sizes of HEMMs are being provisioned for opencast projects of India which are at par with  the World technology.
Due to use of latest software for planning in OC mines, deployment of Electric Rope(ER) shovels  of 42 Cum and dump trucks of 240 T was made during the past years for opencast projects, which are the highest sizes  proposed in India so far.
Use of surface miners has eliminated drilling and blasting operations in the opencast projects and  as such, the problem of working very near to inhabited areas has been sorted out due to elimination of blasting vibrations.
Moreover, because of possible selective mining, the chances of contamination of produced coal with extraneous materials  has also been minimised.
GPRS based vehicle tracking system has facilitated to monitor the movement of all the coal  transportations trucks and any deviation beyond the geo-fenced Area is detected online immediately.
This has helped in  curbing the pilferage of coal to a large extent.
(b) Billing of salary & wages, sales billing, material management system, financial accounting, etc.
through Coalnet System,  have been started.
which would improve the speed with accuracy.
(c) The average productivity of departmental drills has increased substantially due to introduction of hydrostatic drill.
The  outcome of project on “3-D Seismic survey for coal” will help in evaluating 3-D seismic technology for coal exploration in  Indian scenario and its implementation in CIL.
(iii)  Details of efforts on imported technology:  Proposals for acquisition of technology/methodology have been taken up under various Joint Working Group forums i.e.
Indo-US,  Indo-Australia, Indo-Japan, etc.

A. brief outline of the company’s CSR policy, including overview of projects or programs proposed to be undertaken and  a reference to the we-link to the CSR policy and projects or programs.
Corporate Social Responsibility, though obligatory and mandatory, has now transcended to such a convincing belief that many  Corporates feel, for their business to be successful the communities around also have to prosper.
It ought to be a mutually  beneficial symbiotic co-existence.
It is important to earn the trust and loyalty of the communities within the proximity of business  operations to take forward one’s own goals.
This is more apt for a mining company like Coal India Limited.
In India, coal deposits occur in places that are thickly inhabited.
If this prime commercial energy fuel has to be accessed for  greater national development goals, it is inevitable that people are relocated from their original habitat.
But, Coal India res ponds  in a responsive and responsible manner to the rights of these people.
Loyalty is given to the values that a company stands for and  Coal India values impacting the quality of lives of communities around its mining areas.
Coal India is of firm conviction elevating the living standards of affected people is as important as attaining its business g oals.

CIL’s growth plan for the future is i n synergy  with the ambitious plan of the Government for round the clock power supply to all homes of the Country.
Sustainability of such growth by  minimizing the environmental impact being a major issue, thrust is given in qualitative improvement in coal production through selective  mining, beneficiation and blending.
CIL has envisaged coal production and off-take target of 598.61Mt in 2016-17.
75% of the said production would be consumed by  power sector only.
A roadmap to achieve more than 900Mt of coal production by 2019-20 has also been prepared.
This would call f or  developing matching logistics infrastructure.
Apart from creating new infrastructure, optimum utilization of existing capacity through a  dynamic process of source rationalization is another key area of activity.
By means of launching linkage auction scheme, an in- built  system of source rationalization has already been put in place for non-regulated sector.
CIL has planned a capital investment of ` 7765 Crs for maintaining its volume growth in 2016-17.
In addition, the company has also  envisaged for investment of ` 5059 Crs in different other schemes in 2016-17 like development of railway infrastructure project, solar  power, railway wagon procurement, Coal Bed Methane (CBM), revival of fertilizer plants etc.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015-16 189 Marketing Outlook: The Working Group on Coal and Lignite, during the process of formulation of XII Plan document, projected a widening gap between   demand and indigenous availability to the tune of 273 MT by 2021-22.
The present production roadmap of 908.10MT from CIL source s  by 2019-20 would substantially reduce the gap.
It is envisaged that barring the import of coking coal, essentially for quality reasons, India  will be self-sufficient in meeting the requirements of thermal coal by 2019-20.
Non-Coking Coal imports in the country had decl ined by  17.69 MT from 174.07 MT  in 2014-15 to 156.38 MT in 2015-16 resulting in substantiating saving  foreign exchange.
CIL has also taken an initiative to build matching logistics infrastructure to ensure evacuation of planned quantity of product ion.
The  following activities have already been initiated to augment rail evacuation capacity: i.
Investment in procuring high capacity wagons for movement of coal in dedicated circuit.
ii.
Joint Ventures (JVs) have been incorporated by coal companies with State Governments and Railways for creating rail infrastructure.
iii.
Three major last mile rail connectivity projects at Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have been brought under the PMO  monitoring mechanism to ensure commissioning as per schedule.
In order to provide a transparent platform to plan coal procurement by end-users in the medium term horizon, the following new e-auction  windows have been made operative in the electronic coal distribution system, in addition to the usual spot and forward e-auction: i.
Special forward e-auction for Power: Targeted for utilities and CPPs - a window to firm-up coal procurement plans.
ii.
Exclusive forward e-auction for Non-Power: Targeted for non-power consumers —a window to firm-up coal procurement plans.
Customer satisfaction through quality assurance is another key area for improvement.
Following initiatives are identified towar ds quality  improvement and assurance: i.
Supply of (-) 100 mm sized coal to power sector consumers w.e.f.
1 st Jan’16.
ii.
Third party sampling facility being extended for Special Forward e-auction for power iii.
All major laboratories across the subsidiaries of coal companies are now equipped with the Automatic “Bomb Calorimeter” for  ascertaining calorific value Operations Outlook: CIL has identified 123 on-going projects and 67 future/new projects, which will together contribute about 80% of total coal production  envisaged for 2019-20.
Subsidiaries such as SECL, MCL, NCL and CCL will be the major contributors.
The expansion program will be managed in a structured manner with the help of IT enabled actions.
The implementation of ERP solution  to enable transparency in operations, maintenance and support functions is under consideration.
The Company has already concluded a study for mechanization and automation level across a substantial number of mines.
This is  aimed at identification of opportunities in mine planning, exploration, survey, operations and maintenance and are under different phases  of implementation.
To support increase in production on a sustainable basis, synergic growth in exploration is absolutely necessary.
Increased use  of  hydrostatic drilling with PCD bits and 2D Seismic Survey Technology to achieve high rate in exploration has been envisaged.
CIL  will  continue to focus on increasing its reserve base in India.
CIL is in the process of augmenting the capacity of training institutes across subsidiaries, including IICM.

The  Income from sale of coal is mainly dependent on the pricing and production of coal and distribution thereof.
For the first time in the history of Coal India Limited, the gross sales of the company exceeded the landmark figure of `100000 crore  registering a growth of 13.32% over the previous year.
Although, the gross sales for the year amounted to `108150.03 crore against the  previous year gross sales of `95434.76 crore, the net sales for the year amounted to `75644.27 crore against the previous year figure  of `72014.62 crore, thereby registering an increase of only 5.04%.
This was mainly owing to incidence of higher levies by way of cl ean  energy cess, National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET), District Mineral Foundation (DMF).
While the clean energy cess was raised from  `200 per tonne to `400 per tonne w.e.f 01.03.2016, there was a similar increase to `200 per tonne from `100 per tonne w.e.f 01.03.2015.
Further there were also introduction of new levies administered through MMDR Act under the nomenclature- National Mineral Exploration  Trust (NMET)& District Mineral Foundation (DMF) at a combined rate of around 4.48% on basic value of coal sold.
Changes/introduction  in aforesaid levies resulted in substantial increase in statutory levies.
About 84% of our coal was sold under notified price to customers having fuel supply agreements (power and other than power both   included) and sale of beneficiated coal (washed coal) and other by products was around 4% through negotiated price with custome rs  About 12% of total coal sold was through e-auction mechanism, the price determination of which is completely dependent on marke t  dynamics.
Offtake during 2015-16 increased to 534.50 million ton (including the offtake from Gare Palma Mines held as custodian/akin to custodian  and considered as a part of revenue as per legal advice) from 489.38 million ton in previous year, registering a growth over 9%.
The incremental net sales were around 5% mainly owing to the decline in average realization of coal sales through e-auction.
The average  fall in e-auction price was around `592/ton i.e.
to `1858/ton in FY 2015-16 from `2450/ton in FY 2014-15, resulting in decrease in sales  by `3924 crore.
However, increase in e-auction volume by around 20 MT in FY 2015-16 has resulted in increase in sales by `4753 crore.
Other Operating Revenue: The company charges additional fixed transportation costs for transportation of coal to dispatch points beyond 3 kilometers from the  pit head, based on distance involved at certain rates, which is known as Loading and additional transportation charges.
Major e lement  of other operating revenue is on account of “Loading and additional transportation charges” recovered from the customers.
Durin g the  financial year 2015-16 the net revenue earned on this account was `2238.62 crore as against `2026.96 crores in FY 2014-15.
Other  operating revenue also included Facilitation Charges on Import of Coal (for the services provided by CIL as a part of fulfillme nt of FSA),  and Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works received from Govt.

The contractual expense comprises for both coal production as well as removal of overburden.
The composite volume of coal production  and over burden removal under contractual category during the financial year, increased by about 45%.
