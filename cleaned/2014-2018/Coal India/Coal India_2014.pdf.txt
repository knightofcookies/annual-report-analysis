Chairman’s Statement  INTERIM DIVIDEND TO SHARE HOLDERS 290% SPENT ON CSR ACTIVITIES IN 2013-14 `409.37 Cr.
Friends, I am delighted to welcome you to 40th  Annual General Meeting of Coal India  Limited (CIL).
The Directors’ Report and  the Audited Accounts for the year ended  31st March, 2014 together with the report  of the Statutory Auditors and the report and  review of Comptroller & Auditor General of  India are already with you.
Dr. A.K.
Dubey Chairman CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION 100 7 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements CIL Board approved payment of Interim  Dividend of ` 29/- per share of face value of  ` 10/- each i.e.
290% for the year 2013-14.
This was the highest ever Interim Dividend  declared by the Company.
The total out-go  from the Company was  ` 18,317.46 crore  out of which Government of India which  held 90% (at that time) of the Company’s  shares received  ` 16,485.71 crore.
1.
Importance of Coal   Coal provides around 30% of the global primary energy needs  and generates 40% of the world’s electricity.
It is currently  the world’s second largest source of primary energy and is  widely expected to replace oil as the world’s largest source  of primary energy within a few years.
(Source: BP Statistical  Review of World Energy 2011 & World Energy Resources  2013 Survey).
In the Indian context, the importance of coal  scales up even higher.
More than 54.5% of the primary  commercial energy requirements in the country are met by  coal and around 72% of the entire power generated in the  country is coal based.
In fact, coal fired power generation  in our country has been increasing progressively over the  years, with a sudden upsurge happening two years ago.
During 2013-14, coal based power generation increased in  the country by 8.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Recently, International Energy Agency (IEA) has reported  that ‘coal is here to stay for a long time to come’.
Coal  demand will grow at an average rate of 2.3% per year  through 2018, Medium Term Coal Market Report (2013) of  IEA, states.
Coal demand is forecast to stay buoyant over  the next five years.
India and countries in Southeast Asia are  increasing coal consumption.
In the Indian context, coal is irreplaceable as the primary  energy fuel in the foreseeable future.
This is due to  abundant coal reserves and its affordability.
Coal India  produces around 82% of the country’s total coal production  is at the vanguard of the important fuel industry.
The crucial  need is to make conditions conducive for the growth of this  important sector.
India’s ever-increasing demand for coal is expected to  touch 980.5 MT by 2016-17.
Of this, the demand from the  power sector constitutes about 70%.
However, indigenous  coal availability is projected optimistically at 795 MT.
Hence,  major production constraints need to be addressed to boost  production capacity.
Some of the steps that needed to be  undertaken included:  Enhancing drilling for coal exploration,  Fast-tracking land acquisition and R&R issues,  Avoiding delays in obtaining environmental and  forestry clearances,  Timely completion of construction of infrastructural  facilities for coal evacuation and   Providing greater thrust on R&D activities in the coal  sector.
Unless these issues are resolved in a manner conducive to  exploration, extraction and expansion of coal reserves, there  will always be a demand-supply gap for coal.
To bridge this  shortfall, coal needs to be imported.
2.
Vision  Our dream and our vision is to see that there is no shortage  of coal in the country and to make the country self reliant in  coal at the earliest.
Not an easy task I agree, but unless one  dreams big, greater dreams cannot be fulfilled, and, we are  laying a strong foundation for that.
We expect to live upto the social, economic, environmental  and ethical responsibilities bestowed upon us by the policy  makers of this nation that Coal India should support the  country in its energy security.
Our commitment and vision is  that the coal demand should be fully met by the indigenous  coal sources and that the lead role should continue to be  played by Coal India.
To turn this vision into a reality, we have adopted a workable  approach.
Meeting production targets and ramping up  production are an imperative need through efficiency in  operations.
There are 148 ongoing projects during the  current plan period with a production potential of about 484  Mtpa.
126 future projects with a total envisaged production  capacity of about 441 Mtpa are expected to contribute 88  MTs by the terminal year 2016.
Hopefully, our endeavours  to ease the bottlenecks, that have impeded the growth  momentum in the past, would fructify in the future years.
Our new R&R policy has been made more flexible and PAP  friendly, which will help us in acquiring land expeditiously.

CIL, amidst constraints and adversities,  ended the fiscal 2013-14 with an  incremental production of 10.211 MT and  an incremental coal off-take of 6.4 MT on  a YOY comparison.
The Company also  met around 86% of its supply under FSA  commitments to power utilities including  99% of committed quantity to NTPC This would see more coal projects opening up and help in  enhancing the production levels.
Coal India is also planning  to raise production in abandoned UG mines with increased  mechanisation.
CIL’s efforts in acquiring mines abroad are  also another step in shoring up the country’s coal needs.
The Company also envisages to produce in an optimistic  scenario, 615 MTs of coal by the terminal year of XII Five Year  Plan (2016-17).
To ease the coal supply bottlenecks, CIL is  planning to initiate and develop infrastructure facilities like  speeding up the process of laying railway tracks, especially  in those areas where large coal reserves can be tapped.
Development of sidings is another thrust area.
This would  help in increased coal supplies.
Coal crushing capacity is  also being increased.
3.
Activities  We produce coal through seven of our wholly-owned  subsidiaries in India.
Another wholly owned subsidiary,  CMPDIL, carries out exploration activities for our  subsidiaries.
It also provides technical and consultancy  services for our operations and also to third-party clients for  coal exploration, mining, processing and related activities.
We have also established a wholly owned subsidiary in  Mozambique viz Coal India Africana Limitada (CIAL), to  pursue coal mining opportunities in that country.
We have  our core competence across the entire coal business value  chain, starting from exploration, planning and design,  operations, beneficiation and marketing.
Our principal  product is raw coal, primarily non-coking.
We are also  looking for diversification opportunities in areas of coal bed  methane, coal gasification, coal liquefaction and power  generation.
4.
Accomplishments 2013-14  Coal India Limited, amidst constraints and adversities,  ended the fiscal 2013-14 with an incremental production of  10.211 million tonnes (MTs) and an incremental coal off-take  of 6.4 MTs on a year-on-year comparison.
Our Company  also met around 86% of its supply under FSA commitments  to power utilities including 99% of committed quantity to  NTPC.
Even at this level, most of the coal fired power utilities  were stocked with adequate coal.
The Company concluded  the fiscal with a total production and off-take of 462.42 MT  and 471.58 MT respectively.
Our performance during FY 2014 was beleaguered by a  string of issues, many of them extraneous in nature.
Primary  among them were statutory clearances that blunted our  production.
Coupled with that, climatic conditions in the  form of heavy monsoon, post seasonal rains in October and  a cyclone that battered coalfields together with the law and  order problems in CCL & MCL crippled our production and  transportation to a considerable extent.
These issues are not  being flagged off as mere excuses for trailing behind the  target, but they persistently plagued us.
The dispatch to Power sector was 353.83 MT against a  target of 376.18 MT i.e.
a growth of 2.4% and could have  been higher but for the restrictions of intake of coal by  some power stations due to availability of high coal stocks  at the plant end.
The stock level at Power stations as on  31.3.2014 were sufficient for 14 days consumption and  stood at an aggregate level of 20.29 MT of which 18.82 MT  was indigenous coal.
During 2013-14, CIL and its subsidiaries achieved a Profit  Before Tax (PBT) of ` 22879.54 crore and a Profit After Tax  (PAT) of ` 15111.67 crore.
CIL and its subsidiaries paid/ adjusted ` 19713.52 crore towards Royalty, Cess, Sales Tax  and other levies.
Recently, CIL was hailed in the media as ‘the Jewel in the  government’s PSU Crown’, a cash rich company that ‘comes  to government rescue’ and ‘Coal India’s special dividend  payout to boost Govt coffers’.
This was stated in the context  of CIL declaring the highest interim dividend for 2013-14.
On  14th January’2014 CIL Board approved payment of Interim  Dividend of ` 29/- per share of face value of ` 10/- each  i.e.
290% for the year 2013-14.
This was the highest ever  Interim Dividend declared by the Company.
The total out- go from the Company was ` 18,317.46 crore out of which  Government of India which held 90% (at that time) of the  Company’s shares received ` 16,485.71 crore.
In addition,  Govt.
of India also got dividend distribution tax of ` 3,113.05  CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION 100 9 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements Shri Shriprakash Jaiswal, Hon’ble Minister for Coal with Shri S K Srivastava, Secretary to Govt.

This was,  probably, the highest payout by any PSU in the country.
5.
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Coal  Mining   In consonance to the policy of GoI & furthering the production  capabilities of CIL, it has now been decided to work some  of the mines of CIL through PPP mode.
The Model Contract  Agreement (MCA) is in the final stage of approval by CIL  Board of Directors.
Under this concept, the Mine Operator shall develop and  operate the mine.
The contract will be for 15 years initially  and the operators shall carry out all the activities as per the  approved Project Report (PR) of the block.
6.
Accelerate the Power Generation from New  Power Plants  Considering the likely commissioning of new power plants  till the end of March, 2015, the Government of India issued  a fresh Presidential Directive on 17th July’2013, wherein  the list of identified power projects with whom FSAs are to  be signed was increased from 60,000MW to 78,555 MW  capacity.
While the Government has directed CIL to sign  FSAs on achieving stipulated milestones by the power units,  in consonance with the earlier Presidential Directive issued  on 4th April, 2012, the supply of coal would be attuned to  the available long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  with the DISCOMs directly or with Power Trading Companies  having back to back agreements with the DISCOMs.
However, taking into consideration the limited availability of  indigenous coal, apart from reducing the minimum supply  liability of indigenous coal to levels ranging from 65% to 75%  of the year wise Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) for the  years 2013-17, the Presidential Directive also provisioned  scope of review of FSA in respect of minimum level of supply  of indigenous coal once the actual supply liability touched  60,000MW.
Till 31st March, 2014, 160 units of 72,575MW  capacity have signed FSAs.
Out of these FSAs, 56937MW  capacity involving a quantity of 221.64 Mty is backed by  long-term PPA.
7 .
Initiative for Overcoming Logistic Bottleneck  Apart from mandatory offering upto 5% of the Annual  Contracted Quantity of coal through Road or through  Road-cum-Rail (R-C-R) mode in three coal companies, viz.

Other Strategies  To augment the underground production, semi-mechanised  Board and pillar mining with Load Haul Dumper (LHD)/ Side Discharge Loader (SDL) loading with continuous coal  evacuation system are being planned.
Universal Drilling  Machines (UDMs) are also being deployed to increase  productivity of SDL/LHD mines.
They also help to ensure  safety of the workers in the mines.
Mass production  technology methods with Continuous Miner (CM) and  Powered Support Longwall (PSLW) faces, are now being  planned to be introduced in phases in some of the  underground mines.
Man-riding system is being installed  in underground mines to fully utilise the shift hours.
This is  expected to increase productivity and reduce the arduous  travelling time of the personnel in the underground mines.
12.
Coal Beneficiation  At present CIL operates 17 coal washeries with a total  capacity of 39.4 Mty.
Out of these, 13 are coking coal  washeries with a total capacity of 24.90 Mty, while 4 are non- coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 14.50 Mty.
CIL has initiated action through global tenders to establish  16 coal washeries with an aggregate capacity of 100.6  Mty, out of which 6 are coking coal washeries with a total  capacity of 18.6 Mty and 10 non-coking coal washeries with  a capacity of 82.0 Mty.
Construction jobs of three washeries  are in progress and the same for two washeries have been  awarded.
Jobs of other washeries are in different stages of  evaluation.

Safety – Always a Priority   Safety is always our highest priority.
Safety is embedded  in our mission statement and is one of the most important  factors in our overall business strategy.
We have framed a  well defined safety policy to ensure safety in all our mines  and establishments.
We have already established a multi- disciplinary internal safety organisation in all our subsidiaries  for the implementation of our Safety Policy.
All our operations,  systems and processes are meticulously planned  and designed with due regard to safety, conservation,  sustainable development and clean environment.
Our best  endeavours are for inculcating “Safe Operating Procedures  (SOP)” and best safety practices to eliminate all types of  work place injuries and occupational hazards.
We have  identified work place hazards and associated risks in each  mining operation and prepared a risk assessment based  on safety management plan for every mine.
We always  encourage employees’ participations at all levels so as to  promote a proactive safety culture and to improve safety  awareness at the grass root level.
Over the years, the safety standard of our mines have  improved significantly due to genuine commitment and  collective efforts of our employees, continuous and  sustainable safety awareness drives, imparting the best  on-the-job and skill-oriented training to our employees and  using the state-of-the-art technology for improving standard  of safety.
As a result of these sustained endeavours, the  numbers of serious injuries in the year 2013 have reduced to  the lowest level since the inception of our Company in 1975.
However, we are not complacent and our sincere efforts are  aimed at providing safety in all spheres of our activities.
In 2013-14, CIL introduced ‘Third Party’  sampling and analysis system in place of  the existing ‘Joint ‘sampling and analysis’  system to improve transparency in the  process of coal sampling and analysis.

17 .
Green Initiatives  As a responsible corporate citizen, it has always been the  endeavour of CIL to conserve our ecosystem by taking  appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of mining and  associated activities in accordance with EIA / EMP of each  project.
We appreciate the need for reclamation and restoration  of the mined out land.
We have created a green wealth  of about 81 million plants including 13.36 lakhs saplings  planted during 2013-14.
Satellite surveillance has been  adopted for monitoring reclamation activities of 50 major  OCPs, producing 5.0MM3 (Coal + OB) or more every year  and other OCPs once in three years.
It is evident from  satellite surveillance that reclaimed land area has increased  by 4.53 sq.Km during 2013 in 50 major OCPs.
Study of National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), ISRO,  Hyderabad in 2013 reveals that the fire area in Jharia  Coalfields had reduced from 8.9 sq km (as assessed in  Master Plan) to 2.0 sq Km after undertaking various methods  while implementing the Master Plan.
As a green initiative during 2013-14, CIL has installed two  solar power generating projects of 2.0MW and 0.25 MW  capacities in its two subsidiary companies.
Besides, various energy conservation methods have also  been implemented in our projects.
6 rain water harvesting  structures have been installed during 2013-14 to recharge  the groundwater strata and conserve rain water effectively.
CIL is implementing globally recognised Integrated  Management System conforming to the requirements of ISO  9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 (OHSAS) Certifications.
Till 31-03-2014, two subsidiaries namely NCL & MCL are  ISO 9001, ISO 14001 & ISO18001 (OHSAS) certified.
Another Subsidiary, CMPDIL and other 62 units are also ISO  9001 certified.
In addition accreditations were obtained by  73 units for ISO 14001 & 28 units of ISO 18001.
CIL has planned for obtaining Certificates for the balance  units / projects of all subsidiaries to become an ISO 9001,  ISO 14001 an OHSAS 18001 certified company, by the end  of 2015-16.

COAL MARKETING  3.1 (a)  Off-take of Raw Coal  Off-take of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend and reached 471.58 million tonnes for fiscal ended March 2014,  surpassing previous highest figure of 465.18 million tonnes achieved during the last year, i.e., an increase of 1.4 % over the  last year.
The overall raw coal off-take achieved was 95.8 % of the Annual Action Plan Target.
Company-wise Coal off-take  The Company-wise target vis-à-vis actual off-take for 2013-14 and 2012-13 are shown below: (Figs.

From the above, it may be seen that ECL and BCCL had not only exceeded their targets but also achieved positive growth  over last year’s off-take.
Barring CCL, WCL and NEC all other coal companies registered a positive growth in off-take.
Off-take  from CCL was affected due to i) strike by contractor’s workers, dismantling of Purnadih bridge as per the order of High Court ii)  stringent restrictions imposed by State Government to ensure implementation of permissible carrying capacity causing resentment  among the contractors and their reluctance to execute the contract iii) Naxalite/Extremists restricted loading from Tori siding for a  considerable period of time and iv) frequent Bandhs / local agitation.
At WCL, unprecedented heavy rain during monsoon had a  devastating effect.
Damaged roads and bridges, inundation of open-cast mines, badly affected coal transportation and off-take.
Less lifting by MAHAGENCO-Power stations, MPEB-Sarni, HPGCL-Panipat, GEB-Ukai etc.
also led to the shortfall.

Growth in despatches via rail mode was 3.3 %  whereas overall non-rail mode it went down by 1.4 % compared to previous year.
Movement by MGR was at par with last year.
The  performance could have been even better, but for less movement through MGR at ECL, NCL, MCL and WCL.

3 Wagon Loading  Overall wagon loading materialisation was 90.3 % of target.
This was achieved due to sustained efforts and regular coordination  with railways at different levels.
The increase in loading over last year was of 6.12 rakes per day.
Company wise performance  showed that ECL, NCL and SECL had exceeded last year’s level of loading and almost achieved their target.
Also, Rake loading  performance was more than last year at BCCL, WCL and MCL.

The loading would have been more but for the following reasons:   Cyclone ‘Phailin’ followed by devastating rainfall in October’  2013.
At ECL, regulated lifting by many power utilities like  WBPDCL, NTPC, DPL and RGTP-Hissar etc either, due to  high stock at TPS end or non-payment of advance coal  values as per terms of FSA and frequent railway restrictions  due to movement of imported rakes/up-country movement.
At CCL, Naxalite/Extremists restricted loading from Tori  siding for a considerable period of time; frequent bandhs/  local agitation and regulated lifting by HPGCL power  stations.
At NCL, regulated lifting by HPGCL, RRVUNL and Rajghat  TPS and non-payment of advance coal values as per terms  of FSA by the Power Stations.
At WCL, less lifting by MAHAGENCO-Power stations, MPEB- Sarni, HPGCL-Panipat, GEB-Ukai etc.
At SECL, regulated lifting by GEB & RRVUNL.
At MCL, contractor’s workers went on strike at S-3 and S-4  siding of Talcher field during October’13-January’14 and  restriction in transportation and loading activity imposed  by State Govt of Odisha from 11.00 AM to 3.30 PM during  summer due to excessive heat.
3.4 Consumer Satisfaction i) In order to ensure enhanced customer satisfaction,  special emphasis has been given to quality  management.
Steps were taken to monitor quality  right at the coalface apart from bringing further  improvements in crushing, handling, loading and  transport system.
ii) CIL has built coal handling plants with capacity  of about 296 MT per annum so as to maximise  despatches of crushed/sized coal to the consumer.
In addition, washeries at BCCL, CCL, WCL and NCL  have adequate crushing/sizing facilities of about 39.4  million tonnes.
iii) Measures like picking of shale/stone, selective mining  by conventional mode as well as by surface miners,  adopting proper blasting procedure/technique for  reducing the possibility of admixture of coal with over- burden materials, improved fragmentation of coal etc.
are being taken for improving coal quality.
iv) Surface Miners have been deployed for selective  mining at some of the mines to improve the quality  of coal.
Action is being taken for deployment of more  surface miners in other mines where geo-mining  condition permits.
Already 56 Surface Miners have  been deployed in opencast mines and are working  satisfactorily.
v) Joint sampling system is in vogue for major coal  consuming sectors e.g.
power (utilities as well as  captive), steel, cement, sponge iron covering more  than 95% of total production of CIL.
On overall basis,  large consumers having annual contracted quantity of  0.4 MT or more and having FSA have been covered  under sampling.
vi) From 1st October, 2013, an independent 3rd party  sampling and analysis system was introduced for more  transparency in the system and for smooth operation  in all the areas of subsidiary coal companies of CIL.
Subsidiaries have procured 121 Bomb-Calorimeters  for more accurate and transparent results of analysis  of coal samples.
The sampling and analysis are being  done in the presence of customers as per provision  of FSA at loading end and based on the results the  customers are paying the bills of coal as per analysed  grades.
The achievement of grade conformity in respect  of sampling and analysis had been to the tune of  95.63% (approx.)
in respect of supplies to power  sector during the joint sampling period i.e.
from April  2013 to September 2013 and to the tune of 92.63%  (approx.)
during the third party sampling period i.e.
from October 2013 to March 2014. vii) Electronic weighbridges with the facility of electronic  printout have been installed at rail loading points  to ensure that coal dispatches are made only after  proper weighment.
For this purpose, subsidiaries have  installed 169 weighbridges in the Railway Sidings  and 536 weighbridges for weighment of trucks.
Subsidiaries have also taken actions for installation of  standby weighbridges to ensure 100% weighment.
viii) 25 Auto Mechanical Samplers are also working  in subsidiaries for sampling of coal for the bulk  consumers eliminating biasness in sampling process.
Procurement of further AMSs is under process.
3.5 Marketing of Coal (A) Status of Implementation of Different Provisions under  New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) is as under (i) For power stations, commissioned on or before  31.03.2009, 306 million tonnes of coal had been  considered to be supplied through legally enforceable  Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA) with a trigger level of  90%.
The total quantity covered under FSA against the  allocation as on March’14 was 306 million tonnes.
Apart from the above, 179 Letter of Assurances has  been issued to power plants by subsidiary companies  of CIL, as per the recommendations of various SLC (LT)  Meetings, about 426.7 million tonnes of coal.
Further,  100 45 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION as per Presidential Directives dated 16-4-2012, and  a revised directive dated 17-7-2013, the list of Power  Plants and aggregate capacity were revised.
A total  172 Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) were listed with  an aggregate capacity of 78555 MW.
Till 31.3.2014,  160 FSAs have been signed with Power Plants for an  aggregate capacity of 72575 MW.
However, out of the  said capacity, TPPs having capacity of 56,937 MW have  furnished a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)  and qualify for coal supply subject to commissioning  etc.
After a successful meeting with NTPC in July 2013  to resolve the pending FSA issues, signing of FSA  with NTPC power plants appeared in the Presidential  Directives have completed for an aggregate plant  capacity of 13510 MW which included both wholly  owned and JV Plants of NTPC.
(ii) In addition, 6 power plants having Pre-NCDP Long  Term Linkage (commissioned and appearing in the  MOC letter dated 17.02.2012 not having LOA) are  drawing coal under FSA/MOU.
(iii) Out of 1208 valid linked units other than power and  steel plants with eligible FSA quantity of 76.24 million  tonnes, 875 units had executed FSAs for 58.64 million  tonnes.
FSAs of existing consumers were signed in  2008 with tenure of 5 years; many of the FSAs had  expired and are under renewal process.
(iv) For supply of coal to SME sector, 8 million tonnes  was earmarked for allocation to agencies nominated  by the State Govt’s/ UT’s.
17 states / UT’s sent their  nomination of 24 state agencies for the year 2013-14  of which 19 state agencies have signed FSAs for 4.08  million tonnes and drawing coal accordingly.
(v) After implementation of NCDP, 418 LOAs were also  issued to consumers of sponge iron, CPP and cement  as per the recommendations of various SLC (LT)  meetings for a quantity of 65.09 million tonnes per  annum.
Out of these, 312 FSAs have been concluded  till date for 40.81 million tonnes per annum.
(vi) Under Forward E-Auction scheme the quantity  allocated was 4.094 million tonnes as against 4.961  million tonnes allocated during the last year.
During  the period under review, 58.125 million tonnes of  coal was allocated under spot e- auction to the  successful bidders as against 44.256 million tonnes  of coal allocated during the last year.
The notional gain  through Spot E-auction over and above the notified  price was 37.6% as against 49.9% during last year.
(B) Initiative for Overcoming Logistic Bottlenecks  CIL came out with a scheme for supply of coal “As is –  Where is” basis to its power consumers under FSA, to be  taken by the purchasers by arranging their own logistics  from stock points.
The scheme aimed at augmenting coal  despatch capacity which is constrained due to various  logistics issues restricting transportation to dispatch points.
Similar provision is provided in the FSA for the Seller to offer  coal upto 5% of the contracted quantity by using purchaser’s  own transportation arrangements, either by Road or Road  cum Rail (R-C-R) mode in three coal companies namely  CCL, MCL and SECL where logistics inadequacy has  restrained coal supply potentials of these companies.
(C) Financial Impact of Presidential Directive dated 17th  July, 2013  Due to implementation of Presidential Directive dated  17th July, 2013, no compensation has been paid for short  supplies of coal to the new power plants under the terms  of FSA during the year.
Copy of Presidential Directive is  enclosed as Annexure VI.
3.6 Coal Beneficiation  CIL operates 17 coal washeries with a total capacity of 39.40  Mty.
Out of these, 13 are coking coal washeries with a total  capacity of 24.90 Mty and 4 are non coking coal washeries  with a total capacity of 14.50 Mty.
CIL had initiated action  through global tender to establish 16 coal washeries with a  total capacity of 100.60 Mty, out of which 6 are coking coal  washeries with a total capacity of 18.60 Mty and 10 are non  coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 82.00 Mty.
Construction jobs at three washeries are in progress.

j) Reduction in Fire Area  The coal mining operations in Jharia Coalfield have  been continuing for more than 100 years by the  erstwhile private owners.
Due to un-scientific mining  methods adopted by them, large areas of coal mines  were subjected to mine fires and subsidence which  had resulted in serious social and environmental  problems in the area.
At the time of the nationalisation  of coal mines in 1972-73 and taking over the mines  by BCCL, the situation of mine fires was grave and  fire had extended to about 9 sq.km.
as assessed by a  World Bank team.
At present, fire area has been reduced from 9 sq.
km.
to 2 sq.km.
as per the satellite survey done by National  Remote Sensing Centre, ISRO, Deptt.
of Space,  Hyderabad.
This could be achieved only due to the  100 65 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION successful ‘excavation method i.e.

Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of COAL INDIA  LIMITED, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2014, and  the Statement of Profit and Loss and Cash Flow Statement for the Year  then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other  explanatory information.
These financial statements include figures in  respect of Head Quarter (HQ), Kolkata, North Eastern Coalfields (NEC)  GM’s Office at New Delhi and Marketing Division.
2.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the  Accounting Standards notified under the Companies Act, 1956 (“the  Act”) read with the General circular15/2013 dated 13th September  2013 of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in respect of Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013.
This responsibility includes the design,  implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true  and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.
3.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements  based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures  selected, depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment  of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor  considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and  fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the  purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s  internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness  of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
100 89 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the  explanations given to us, the financial statements, read together with  Significant Accounting Policies and Additional Notes to Accounts as  referred in Note 33 and 34 respectively give the information required  by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India: a) In the case of Balance Sheet, the state of affairs of the  Company as at 31st March, 2014; b) In the case of Statement of Profit and Loss Account, the  profit/ loss for the year ended on that date; and c) In the case of Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows for the  year ended on that date.
Emphasis of Matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to: a) Notes No.11 (1), 12(2) and 18 dealing with investments in and loans  & advances (Short term / Long term, Current Account debit balances)  to sick subsidiary of the Company, that is, Eastern Coalfields Limited  (ECL) which is under the Board of Industrial & Financial Reconstruction  (BIFR).
Revival plans have been approved by BIFR and vetted by the  concerned ministry.
On implementation of revival schemes the subsidiary  is turning around and has started earning profits.
In view of the changing  circumstances, the management is of the opinion that no writing down or  provisioning is required.
This is a statement of fact referring to the notes on  accounts only.
Eastern Coalfields Ltd is a 100% subsidiary of Coal  India Limited.
The revival scheme of BIFR is under  implementation and ECL is earning substantial  profit since 2009-10, by which its negative net  worth is getting reduced.
Hence, the diminution in  value of investment is not considered as permanent  in nature and therefore following the provisions of  AS 13 ( Accounting Standard on Investments ), no  writing down or provisions is required.
The Loans  & Advances and Current Account debit balances  etc are also on the same analogy considered to  be recoverable and hence no provision is required.
b) Not e No.
10A(2) regarding non-provision against fixed assets in Dankuni  Coal Complex leased to South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) for  lease rent of Re.1 per annum.
In the opinion of the management the  nominal income earning is a temporary policy matter and actual worth  of the assets including land is much higher than the book value and as  such no provision is called for.
This is a statement of fact referring to the notes on  accounts no 10A (2) only.
As mentioned by the Audit, referring to the relevant  Note, the recoverable value (actual worth), of  the assets of Dankuni Coal Complex (given on  operating lease to SECL, a 100% subsidiary of  CIL on a nominal rent) is considered much higher  than its WDV.
Hence no provision as per AS-28  (Accounting Standard on Impairment) or otherwise  is required.

Since the Central Government has not issued any notification as to the  rate at which the cess is to be paid under section 441A of the Companies  Act, 1956, nor had it issued any Rules under the said section, prescribing  the manner in which such cess is to be paid, no cess is due and payable  by the Company.

Annexure - III 1.
Specific areas in which R&D is being carried out  The Government of India through its Coal Science &  Technology (S&T) Plan and Coal India Limited through its  R&D Board have been promoting R&D activities in Coal &  Lignite Sectors for improvement in production, productivity,  safety, quality, coal beneficiation and utilisation, protection  of environment and ecology and allied fields.
Substantial  funds are being earmarked annually by the Ministry of Coal  and CIL R&D Board to carry out research work on the above  subjects in the above fields.
2.
Benefits derived as a result of the above R&D Initiatives  Notable advances have been made through R&D efforts in  coal exploration techniques, introduction of mining methods  like “blasting gallery and cable bolting” for recovery of coal  in thick seams and shortwall mining at SECL with an output  of more than 1000T per day being replicated in more panels.
‘Controlled blasting’ has also been introduced through R&D  and is being used now for removal of overburden rocks and  coal in opencast mines as close as to 50m from surface  structures successfully.
More than 155 Mt of coal so far  has been extracted in more than 134 mines by introduction  of ‘Controlled Blasting’ which otherwise would have been  remained sterilised.
A quantified assessment of roof strata called Rock Mass  Rating (RMR) developed under R&D is now being used for  designing support in underground mines.
So far, over 859  districts in about 297 underground coal mines have been  covered.
A number of research projects have yielded considerable  gains in the area of land reclamation after mining and  utilisation of fly ash.
Humic acid from lignite as a fertilizer  in agriculture has shown 35% increase of yield in case of  capsicum, tomato crops and also substantial increase in  other crops.
This product has been commercialised and is  being used by the farmers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,  Karnataka and Kerala.
A multi institutional funded (UNDP/GEF, CIL and MoC)  demonstration research project on “Coal Bed Methane  Recovery and Commercial Utilisation” has successfully  concluded at Moonidih underground project, BCCL with  encouraging results.
The gas recovered under this project  is almost 98% pure methane, which is being utilised to run  gas based generators to supply electricity to Moonidih mine  residential colony.
Significant improvement has been achieved in both ‘coking  and non-coking coal washing’ and ‘recovery of fine coals’.
Encouraging results have also been obtained from research  related to ‘combustion techniques’ for effective utilisation of  high-ash coals.
Major R&D projects on fine coal beneficiation  are under implementation through CIL R&D funding.
While some research projects have produced tangible  impact on industry directly, there are others, which have  strengthened mine planning, design and technical services  required by both operating mines and future mining projects.
A number of research projects have been taken up in the area  of environment and ecology to integrate coal mining activities  with ecological conservation and hazards due to mining.
The  findings of these research projects have made a significant  impact on the industry resulting in adoption of proper  environment control.
Efforts to delineate unstable working  below Howrah Dhanbad Railway line (Eastern Railway Main  Line), stability analysis by numerical modeling and possible  remedial measures for stabilisation of railway line have been  made successfully with CIL R&D funds.
Programmable Logic  Control(PLC) based monitoring & control system has been  successfully designed, developed and introduced in an  underground mine of CIL duly approved by DGMS through  another research project funded by CIL R&D Board.
New areas are being addressed through on-going research  projects with CIL R&D fund.
This Includes application of  robotics and latest two-way communication systems for  rescuing miners trapped in underground mines, Coal Bed  Methane (CBM)/Coal Mine Methane(CMM)/Abandoned Mine  Methane(AMM) recovery and utilisation, utilisation of low  rank low volatile high rank Indian coking coals, numerical  models to address strata control problems for appropriate  solution, safe dragline dump profiles for varying geo-mining  conditions, Green House Gas(GHG) emissions in mine fire  areas, treatment of acid mine water generated in Indian coal  mines, roof fall prediction in underground coal mines, dry coal  beneficiation, development of integrated dumper collision  avoidance system for opencast mines, assessment of shale  gas Gondwana basin with special reference to CIL areas.
An indigenous tool for carrying out the job of random  sampling and testing of explosives and accessories for  mines of CIL has been developed by CMPDI in association  with IIT, Kharagpur through CIL R&D project.
Research & Development (R&D) 100 99 Company OverviewStatutory ReportsFinancial Statements CO-CREATING VALUE FOR THE NATION  A research project under S&T grant of Ministry of Coal  regarding delineation of barrier thickness against  waterlogged workings in underground mines has been  completed.
In this project, a Ground Penetrating Radar  (GPR) was developed.
After making field trials it was  observed that the GPR developed is capable of detecting  anomaly in barrier thickness up to a distance of 60m.
A research project under S&T grant of Ministry of Coal  related to mine communication has been completed at one  of the underground mines of CCL.
This consists of Through- The-Earth (TTE) one way messaging system and two way  voice communication and tracking system.
The integrated  system is now being used with digital wireless telephones  in Bhurkunda mine of CCL.
Now one can make and receive  a telephone call from underground.
3.
Future Plan of Action  For enhancing the quantum of research work needed to  address the complexity of operations of coal industry and  wider involvement of research organisations including private  organisations with adequate infrastructure and expertise,  CMPDI on behalf of Ministry of Coal has invited Expression  of Interest (EoI) for areas related to mining methods, strata  control, and mine safety, coal bed methane(CBM), etc., for  funding under S&T Grant of Ministry of Coal.
Future R&D efforts will address areas like liquidation of  developed pillar in underground mines, pit and dump  slope stability in opencast mines, hydraulic mining, high  wall mining, Early warning systems for roof prediction  and dump & highwall failures, assessment of shale gas  potentiality in Indian coal fields, CBM reserves estimation,  CBM from fugitive emissions from opencast mines, in-situ  coal gasification, coal liquefaction, and development of  predictive models for air quality and pollution etc.
In another research project, self advancing goaf edge  (mobile) chock type supports have been developed and  are under field trial at Bastacola mine of BCCL.
These self  propelled mobile supports of medium duty (2 x 200 Te.)
have closed and extended height range of 1.85 to 3.2 m  and can offer support resistance of 71.4 T/ m2.
Another important research project, Shale gas potentiality  evaluation of Damodar basin of India is under implementation  with an objective to evaluate Damodar basins of India for  their shale gas potentiality through integrated geophysical,  geological, geochemical and petrophysical investigations.
Another research project titled “Coal Bed Methane (CBM)  reserves estimation for Indian Coalfields” has started  recently with an objective to calculate CBM reserve estimate  by volumetric method followed by uncertainty analysis by  probabilistic method and generate an accurate geological  model of a study area with associated coal Seams by 2D/3D  seismic survey and acquisition of conventional surface  /  subsurface information and validation of the model by  drilling core holes.
Emphasis has been put on “coal to oil” conversion technology.
The prevailing high prices level of crude and petroleum  products warrants a fresh look at coal liquefaction process.
The rising costs and issues related to adequate and assured  supply of oil from overseas have a significant bearing on both  the national economy and energy security.
One important  project for development of indigenous catalyst for coal – to  - liquid (CTL) is under implementation with an objective to  eliminate the dependency on technology provider for supply of  catalysts for future CTL plants likely to be established in India.
4.
Expenditure on R&D  Total Expenditure incurred from 2009-10 to 2013-14 for  research projects is as follows: (` in crore) Year Expenditure 2009-10 37.42 2010-11 40.08 2011-12 26.29 2012-13 22.72  2013-14 22.73 TOTAL 149.24 TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION, ADAPTATION AND INNOVATION 1.
R&D in coal sector is mainly for improvement of efficiency  parameters in mining operations including mine safety and  related activities like coal beneficiation/utilisation and also  for control of the mine environment.

Annexure IV Observation of Auditor and Management Explanation  under Section 217(3) of Companies Act, 1956 Observation of Auditor Management Explanation 1.
Notes No.11 (1), 12(2) and 18 dealing with investments in and  loans & advances (Short term / Long term, Current Account  debit balances) to sick subsidiary of the Company, that is,  Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) which is under the Board of  Industrial & Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).
Revival plans have  been approved by BIFR and vetted by the concerned ministry.
On implementation of revival schemes the subsidiary is turning  around and has started earning profits.
In view of the changing  circumstances, the management is of the opinion that no writing  down or provisioning is required.
This is a statement of fact referring to the notes on  accounts only.
Eastern Coalfields Ltd is a 100% subsidiary of Coal  India Limited.
The revival scheme of BIFR is under  implementation and ECL is earning substantial profits  since 2009-10, by which its negative net worth is getting  reduced.
Hence, the diminution in value of investment  is not considered as permanent in nature and therefore  following the provisions of AS 13 (Accounting Standard  on Investments), no writing down or provisions is  required.
The Loans & Advances and Current Account  debit balances, etc.
are also on the same analogy  considered to be recoverable and hence no provision  is required.
2.
Note No.
10A(2) regarding non-provision against fixed assets  in Dankuni Coal Complex leased to South Eastern Coalfields  Limited (SECL) for lease rent of Re.1 per annum.
In the opinion  of the management the nominal income earning is a temporary  policy matter and actual worth of the assets including land is  much higher than the book value and as such no provision is  called for.
This is a statement of fact referring to the notes on  accounts no 10A (2) only.
As mentioned by the Audit, referring to the relevant  Note, the recoverable value (actual worth), of the  assets of Dankuni Coal Complex (given on operating  lease to SECL, a 100% subsidiary of CIL on a nominal  rent) is considered much higher than its WDV.
Hence  no provision as per AS-28 (Accounting Standard on  Impairment) or otherwise is required.

And whereas the Object III.A.4 of the Memorandum of  Association of Coal lndia Limited provides as follows:-  “CIL to act as an entrepreneur on behalf of the state in respect  of the coal industry and plan and organise production of  coal as also its beneficiation and the manufacture of other  by-products of coal in accordance with the targets fixed in  the Five Year Plan and the economic policy and objectives  laid down by the Government from time to time’.
4.
Whereas Article 37 of the Articles of Association of Coal  India Limited inter-alia Provides as under:-  “Notwithstanding anything contained in all these Articles  the President may from time to time issue such directives  Directives issued under Article 37 of the Memorandum   and Articles of Association of Coal India Limited or instructions as may be considered necessary in regard  to the conduct of business and affairs of the Company and  in like manner may vary and annul any such directives or  instruction.
The Directors shall give immediate effect to  the directives of instructions so issued.
In particular’ the  President will have the Powers:- (i) To give directives to the Company as to the exercise and  performance of its functions in matters involving national  security or substantial public interest.” 5.
And whereas the policy regarding power generation /  capacity addition of coal based power plants has been  based on coal linkage and coal availability of 100% of  the normative requirement, corresponding to 85% PLF  and assured supply of coal by CIL.
Banks and Financial  Institutions, developers and the competitive bidding regime  are critically dependent on the quantity of linkage / LoA given  and supplies made.
Failure to supply adequate quantity will  have many consequences affecting the power utilities and  ultimately, the consumers of power.
Any major deviation  in the coal supplies will have far reaching implications on  power and financial sector and ultimately on the economic  growth of the country.
Therefore, this is considered a matter  involving substantial public interest.
6.
Now, therefore, keeping in view the need for making  adequate coal available to the power utilities, in exercise  of the power conferred under Article 37 of the Articles  of Association read with the Object contained in Article  III.A.4 of Memorandum of Association of CIL, the President  is pleased to issue a directive to CIL to implement the  decisions mentioned above within a period of four weeks  in so far as the matter of signing of FSAs with the power  projects commissioned during 01.04.2009 to 31.03.2015 is  concerned and as mentioned at para 1(i).
7.
In continuation of para 1(i) above, read with letter No.FU- 12/2011-IPC (Vol.II) dated 14.5.2013 of the Ministry of Power,  once the actual capacity of 60000 MW of power plants out  of the said 78000 MW becomes eligible for drawing coal  as per the FSA, the actual supply schedule may be further  reviewed with the Ministry of Coal.

This Ministry’s letter No.
23011/185/2011-CPD dated  17.02.2012 and the Presidential Directive of the same  number dated 04.04.2012 would stand modified to this  extent.

Accountability of Directors  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a mutually negotiated agreement and contract between the Administrative Ministry/ Government of India (MoC) and the Management of CPSE (CIL) to fix the targets before the beginning of the financial year and is  intended to evaluate the performance of CIL after the completion of the Financial year vis-à-vis the target fixed.
In line with the MoU  between CIL & MOC, CIL further signs MoU with all its subsidiaries within the stipulated timeframe.
It is done by adopting a system of “five point scale” and “criteria weight” which ultimately result in calculation of “composite score”  or an index of audited performance of the enterprise.
The composite score is forwarded to DPE through the administrative ministry  viz.
MoC duly approved by CPSE Board by August of the succeeding financial year in line with the guidelines prescribed by DPE  for their vetting.
The component of performance evaluation mainly consists of financial and non-financial parameters which carry equal weightage  of 50% each.
The key parameters are gross margin, net sales and other related financial ratios, CSR and Sustainability, R&D, project  implementation, HRM, Quality & Customer satisfaction, coal production & off-take, productivity & safety, extent of globalisation  etc.
CIL has been vigorously pursuing this system since 1988-89, which has helped immensely in fulfillment of its long ranging  objectives, aspirations and overall growth over the period.
The entire process also ensures transparency as well as accountability  towards all stakeholders.

(vii) Development of a notch cutting machine to facilitate  construction of stoppings in underground coal mines.
The disbursement of fund for CIL R&D Projects during the  year 2013-14 was `10.97 crore.
5.0  RISKS AND CONCERNS  The major risk and concerns of CIL are outlined below:   Coal mining by its inherent nature is subject to  multiple operational risks like difficult geo-mining  conditions ,weather, natural disasters and poor  mining conditions.
CIL is further constrained by stringent labour  regulations.
The Company also has a ageing  workforce.
CIL may face difficulties in the acquisition of land in a  timely manner, particularly in respect of land owned  by private parties and forest land, resulting in delays  in some of their projects.
Success of expansion projects depends on various  factors including obtaining government permits,  licenses and approvals to proceed with its expansion  programmes.
Rail transportation, operated by the Indian Railways,  is the main transportation mode utilised by CIL for  coal transportation, particularly for long distance  supply arrangements.
CIL’s sales volumes have in the  past been constrained by inadequate transportation  capacities, including non-availability of adequate  railway infrastructure.
Apart from above the following risks are also  identified  Commodity Risk  The price of our raw coal and products sold at a price  pursuant to our memoranda of understanding with  customers and the price of raw coal sold under our  E-Auction schemes, and consequently our revenues,  are subject to the risk of fluctuation in prices of coal and  coal products in the international markets.
In addition, we  use significant quantities of petroleum-based fuel and  lubricants, explosives, tyres, steel and other raw materials  and consumables in our mining operations, and are  exposed to fluctuations in the prices of these materials.
Operating Risk  Our operations are subject to various operating risks that may  materially increase our cost of mining operations and delay  or disrupt production at particular mines either permanently  or for varying lengths of time, which could have a material  adverse effect on our business, results of operations and  financial condition.
We currently maintain insurance for our  business premises and cash-in-transit insurance.
We also  do not maintain insurance coverage for loss of our assets  such as our equipment, plant and machinery nor do we  maintain third party insurance; as the cost of effecting such  insurance cover outweighs the chances of materialisation of  such risks.
Currency Exchange Risk  Changes in currency exchange rates may affect our results  of operations.
100% of our debt is denominated in foreign  currencies( which however is not significant).
Depreciation  of the Indian rupee against the foreign currencies may  adversely affect our results of operations by increasing the  cost of financing any debt denominated in foreign currency  or any proposed capital expenditure in foreign currencies.

However during the year, the balance outstanding  amount of the foreign currency loans drawn from JBIC  bank (denominated in Japanese Yen) and IBRD bank  (denominated in US Dollar) for implementation of coal  sector rehabilitation project in various subsidiaries has been  prepaid.
This used to form a major part of our debt.
With  prepayment of these loans the risk of foreign exchange  fluctuations were therefore substantially eliminated.
However, we expect our future capital expenditure in  connection with our proposed expansion plans to include  expenditure in foreign currencies for imported equipment  and machinery.
Effect of Inflation  Inflation has a direct impact on our cost as employees’  remuneration costs constitutes around 50% of the total cost  of the Company and major part of it is dearness allowance  which is directly linked to inflation.
Apart from this items like  power & fuel, stores, contractual expenses etc.
also have an  impact of inflation.
6.0  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR  ADEQUACY  Coal India Limited (CIL) has robust internal control systems  and processes in place for smooth and efficient conduct of  business and complies with relevant laws and regulations.

Increase in salary is due to the annual normal increment in salary  and DA, which however is offset to some extent by decrease in  employees due to retirement.
Output per manshift (OMS) during 2013-14 improved to 5.62  Tonnes per manshift from 5.32 Tonnes per manshift of previous  year Power and Fuel Power and fuel represents cost of electricity consumed in our  operations, including electricity purchased from external sources  and cost of internal power generation relating to diesel generator  sets.
Power and fuel expenses was ` 2282.23 crore in fiscal 2014 as  against ` 2333.48 crore during FY 2013.The higher amount of  power & fuel in previous year FY 2013 was due to payment of  some arrear liability during previous year.
Welfare Expenses Welfare expenses represents various expenses associated with  social welfare activities, CSR activities and expenses associated  with medical expenses for retired employees.
Expenses towards  community development and environmental expenditure are also  reflected under welfare expenses.
Welfare expenses increased by ` 112.37 crore, or 18.05%, from   ` 622.43 crore in fiscal 2013 to ` 734.80 crore in fiscal 2014  primarily on account of an increase in CSR expenses owing to  contribution made on account of natural disasters in Odisha and  Uttaranchal.
Contractual Expenses/ Repairs Contractual charges primarily consist of transportation charges  for coal, sand and materials carried out through third party  contractors, contractor expenses relating to wagon loading  operations, hiring charges for plant and machinery and heavy  earthmoving machinery representing cost of coal extraction  and overburden removal activities outsourced to third party  contractors, and other miscellaneous works carried out  through third party contractors such as for road maintenance  and temporary lighting.
Repairs consist of cost of repair and  maintenance of plant and machinery relating to our operations,  rehabilitation of heavy earthmoving machinery, office equipment,  vehicles and other miscellaneous assets.
