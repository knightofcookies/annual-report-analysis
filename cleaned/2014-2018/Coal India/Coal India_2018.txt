Jha Chairman ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 9 Dear Members, I am delighted to welcome you to the 44th Annual General Meeting of Coal India Limited (CIL).
The Directors’ Report and the Financial Statement for the year ended 31 st March’ 2018 together with the report of Statutory Auditors and report and review of Comptroller & Auditor General of India are already with you.
1.
Importance of coal and Coal India Limited India is on a high orbit growth trajectory expanding industrially and economically.
Concurrently, with this exponential transfo rmation, the country’s energy need is also on the increase.
This is where coal steps in.
You all are aware that in India Coal is the ready answer to escalating energy demand as around 56% of the India’s primary commercial energy is met by coal alone.
Around 73% of the entire power generated in the country is coal based.
The country’s planners however are alternatively exploring to shift from being a largely fossil driven energy economy to one that is powered by clean and renewable energy especially solar.
This is certainly a welcome move as it would supplement coal’s role if not entirely substitute it.
As an industry and nation, we will have to reconcile to the fact that both coal and renewables will co-exist and complement each other in the years to come.
Only then, we will be able to chart the course, which is sustainable, efficient, effective and competitive for India.
On one hand, it will require us to reduce the development risks and constraints to coal mining and on the other, ensuring that the coal industry in India continues its focus on environment and sustainability practices.
There has been significant growth on all parameters of environment and sustainability in coal mining in India – land reclamation, water conservation, forest and wildlife conservation, adoption of renewables, safety, community development and R&R, etc.
However, more needs to be done and as one of the leading players in the Indian coal industry, CIL is committed to do more than what expected from it.
But as base fuel for power, coal is expected to retain its position in the foreseeable future.
What make coal such a preferred energy fuel is its abundance, availability and affordability.
The estimated geological resource of India coal stood at 315.15 Billion tonnes as on 1st Apr’17.
With the rural electrification programme and 24×7 power for all, your company is poised to play a greater and more responsible role as energy supplier in fulfilling the noble cause of the government.
Against this backdrop, you will be proud to know that your company, C IL, spearheads the country’s coal production and produce around 84% of the country’s entire coal output.
It is only CIL, which virtually fuels  and empowers the power sector in the country.
It would not be an exaggeration to state that CIL is synonymous with India’s energy scenario.
Notwithstanding the extraneous factors, CIL is committed to increase its coal supply and meet the coal demand in the country.
We plan to do bet ter on all fronts and are committed to make a difference.
Welcome of Shri Piyush Goyal, Hon’ble Minister for Coal& Railways, Government of India,at the venue by senior officials of Coal India before the inaugural event of 43rd Foundation Day of Coal India, held on 1st November, 2017 10 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.

COAL MARKETING 3.1 (a) Off-take of Raw Coal Off-take of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend and reached 580.284 million tonnes for fiscal ended March 2018, sur passing previous highest figure of 543.32 million tonnes achieved during the last year, i.e., an increase of 6.8 % over the last year.
The overall raw coal off-take achieved was 96.7% of the Annual Action Plan Target.
In the year 2017-18, ECL, CCL, NCL, WCL, SECL and NEC could outperform their achievement of last year.
NCL, WCL & NEC had also exceeded its target.
Company-wise target vis-à-vis actual off-take for 2017-18 and 2016-17 is shown in Annexure 6.
Offtake could have been more, but for the following reasons: ¾ Evacuation problem due to closure of Dhanbad Chandrapura line at Katras & Sijua Areas at BCCL.
¾ Constraints of Rakes as per Indent at MCL & SECL.
¾ Constraints of N -Box at NCL & CCL for movement to upward country.
¾ Frequent Strikes at various mines of Talcher field in MCL & CCL.
¾ Evacuation constraint of Magadh-Amrapali mines at CCL.
Now Tori-Shivpur Rail Line is commissioned upto Balumath, dispatch from Magadh and Amrapali of CCL has started from Balumath siding.
¾ EC issues at Kusmunda mine of SECL.
Initiatives taken for enhancing off-take are as under: z Regular co-ordination with Railway at all levels including Railway Board to optimize use of logistics resources available in th e subsidiary coal companies, analyzing inputs of the subsidiaries to identify alternate source for coal movement wherever and whenever required to achieve overall sectoral targets and mitigating critical fuel requirement of consuming sectors, particular ly power stations.
z Coordination with MOC for various long and short-term policy decisions to overcome coal movement constraints for power and non-power sector consumers and taking operational decisions for moving coal from various sources on contingent situations to meet critical requirements of consuming sectors, particularly power utilities etc.
z Periodic Meetings and follow ups with Power producers in addressing issues relating to coal movement.
z Source Rationalization of coal linkage for optimizing coal movement as per the requirement of the consumers and logistics.
z At the preference of Power Utilities, sources of supply to Power Plants are readjusted on quarterly basis within the Aggregated ACQs under Flexi Utilisation Scheme.
z Besides enhancing dispatches through Rail mode, Power stations within the vicinity of 50-60 KM of the mines having FSA have been offered coal through Road/RCR mode to be lifted by their own transport arrangement for further augmenting the dispatch.
z Ministry of Power has been requested to prevail upon the power plants situated within 20 Kms to lift their entire requirement b y Road mode from 2018-19 onwards, to increase availability of rakes for movement to long distance plants.
z In the Meeting held on 22 nd and 25th January, 2018, taken by the Hon'ble MOS (I/C) for Power and New and Renewable Energy, it was decided that all power plants located within 20 km to 40 Km from pithead shall construct elevated closed belt conveyors/ Coal Washery - to ensure supply of washed coal to coal consumer s 52 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY MGR within 2-3 years.

Implementation of SHAKTI Policy of Government : In consideration of the stressed assets in new power projects not having any long term linkages, on 17.05.2017, Cabinet Committ ee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved a new policy for allocation of future coal linkages in a transparent manner for such power sec tor consumers.
This policy is known as 'Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India' (SHAKTI).
The policy is an important initiative in alleviating a key challenge in power sector i.e.
lack of coal linkage and is expected to positively contribute in  resolution of a number of stressed assets.
Ministry of Coal (MoC) circulated the policy guidelines vide their letter dated 22.05.2017.
The salient features of the policy are: (A) Under the old regime of LoA-FSA : i. FSA may be signed with the pending LoA holders after ensuring that the plants are commissioned by 31.03.2022. ii.
The 583 pending application for LoA may be closed.
iii.
The capacities totaling 68000 MW as per CCEA decision dated 21.06.2013 would continue to get coal at 75% of ACQ even beyond 31.03.2017. iv.
About 19000 MW capacity out of 68000 MW which could not be commissioned by  31.03.2015 may be allowed coal supply under FSA at 75% of ACQ provided these plants are commissioned within 31.03.2022. v. Actual coal supply to power plants shall be to the extent of long term PPA and  medium term PPAs to be concluded in future ag ainst bids to be invited by Discoms as  per bidding guidelines issued by MoP.
With these, the old regime of LoA-FSA would come to finality and fade away.
(B) Following to be considered under new more transparent coal allocation policy for power sector, 2017-SHAKTI (Scheme for Harne ssing and Allocating Koyala (coal) Transparently in India)– i. CIL/ SCCL may grant coal linkages to State/Central Gencos/JVs at notified price on recommendations of Ministry of Power.
ii.
Linkages to IPP having PPA based on domestic coal but no linkage: a. shall be on auction basis where bidders shall quote discount on tariff.
b.
Bid Evaluation Criteria shall be the non-zero Levellised Value of the discount.
iii.
Linkages to IPPs/ Power Producers without PPAs shall be on auction basis where methodology would be similar to that followe d under linkage auction to non-regulated sector i.e.
the bidders would bid for premium above the notified price of the coal company.
iv.
Coal linkages may also be earmarked for fresh PPAs, by pre-declaring the availability of coal linkage with description, to t he States.
States may indicate these linkages to Discoms/ SDAs.
v. Power requirement of group of States can also be aggregated and procurement of such aggregated power can be made by an agency designated by Ministry of Power or authorized by such States on the basis of tariff based bidding.
vi.
Linkages shall be granted for full normative quantity to Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated by nominated agency for setting up Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPP) under Central Government initiative through tariff based competitive under the guidelines for determination of tariff, on the recommendation of MoP.
vii.
MoC in consultation with MoP may formulate a detailed methodology of a transparent bidding process for allocating coal link ages to IPPs, having PPAs based on imported coal, with full pass through of cost saving to consumers.
Under A (i) of SHAKTI Policy, 3 FSAs have been signed for 11.91 MT for the aggregated capacity of 3300 MW and under B(i) 1 FSA has been signed for 3.927 MT for the capacity of 1200 MW till 31st March,18.
CIL successfully conducted Linkage Auction under the B(ii) provision for the Plants having PPAs but no linkages through a bidding based on tariff discount in September 2017.
Out of 31 bidders who submitted EOI, 14 bidders were found eligible by CEA and 10 bidders submitted  EMD and turned out successful for booking 27.18 MTPA.
Flexi Utilization of Domestic Coal for reducing cost of Power generation: Government introduced a policy for flexi utilization of domestic coal by State/Central Gencos to reduce the cost of electricity  in June 2016 following approval of Cabinet.
Under the policy, State/Central Gencos are allowed to aggregate their contracted quantity for su pply to Plants on efficiency based parameters to reduce cost of power generation.
CIL implemented the policy through signing of a supplementary agreement with the State/ Central Gencos in April 2017.
Out of a total annual contracted quantity of 419.9 MTPA with State/Central/CPSE Utilit ies, CIL signed supplementary agreement for 416.1 MTPA covering 99.1%.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 55 3.6 Coal Beneficiation: Presently CIL is operating 15 Coal Washeries with a total coal washing capacity of 36.8 million tonnes per year, of which 11 ar e coking and the rest are non-coking with capacity of 20.58 and 16.22 MTY respectively.
The total washed coal production from these existing was heries for the year 2017-18 has been 12.45 Million Tonnes.
In addition to above, CIL has planned to set up 18 new Washeries with state-of-the-art technologies with an aggregate throughpu t capacity of 95.6 MTY#.
Out of these washeries, 9 are planned to wash coking coal with a cumulative capacity of 28.10 MTY, and the other 9 are being se t up to wash non-coking coal with an aggregate capacity of 67.5 MTY# The major bottlenecks for setting up of these washeries are mainly availability of Land, Forest, Environmental and other Statut ory Clearances, Failure of L1 bidders to comply to tender requirements, etc, in addition to the absence of firm commitment from the intended cu stomers regarding acceptance of washed coal at value added prices.
# Ashoka Non-coking coal Washery capacity is being planned to be enhanced by 2 Mty.
Presently it is planned to be a 2 Mty.

56 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY Reasons for less production than the target 2017-18 : Despite best and consistent efforts, constraints that have impeded the growth in coal production are as under: (i) Issue of Land acquisition, physical possession of land, demand of compensation beyond company norms and R&R affected production in many of the subsidiaries of CIL.
(ii) Delay in grant of enhanced EC capacity and forestry clearance also played a major role in loss of production.
(iii) Law and Order problem by local leaders and villagers in almost all the subsidiaries specially ECL, BCCL, CCL and MCL.
(iv) Sudden stoppage of Dhanbad-Chandrapura railway line affected production in BCCL.
(v) Evacuation constraint at Magadh and Amrapali OCP due to non-completion of Tori-Shibpur railway track affected coal productio n in CCL.
(vi) Accumulation of high coal stock at many of the cost plus OC mines due to less lifting by consumer affected production in WC L. Washed Coal (Coking) Production Subsidiary-wise production of Washed Coal (Coking) is given in Annexure 13A.
Overburden Removal Company-wise overburden removal is disclosed in Annexure 13B.
FUTURE OUTLOOK With continued commitment to play major role in achieving nation's energy security, CIL is poised to set an ambitious target of  610 Mt.
in the FY 2018-19 with an annualized growth of about 7.52 % over the production of 567.36 Mt.
achieved in 17-18.
As per one Billion tonne document prepared in 2014-15, CIL was mandated to produce 908.01 Mt by the year 2019-20, subject to timely grant of EC & FC, land acquisition/possession and associated R & R, coal evacuation facilities, allocation of coal blocks & other rel evant issues.
Meanwhile, consequent upon the outcome of Paris Protocol on climate change and changes in the environmental paradigm and coal d emand, there was an urgent need of revisiting the 1 Bt.
programme.
Ministry of Coal is now in the process of finalizing the Vision 203 0 document for coal sector through a reputed consultant in which projection for likely demand of coal in the country are being assessed under different scenarios considering the views of Ministry of Power & Scenario emerged due to Paris protocol etc.
The document is likely to be finalized  shortly.
In view of above, roadmap for coal production beyond 2018-19 along with other related issues would be relooked on the basis of that demand forecast.
In the light of Paris Protocol and consequent upon changes in world energy sector scenario, CIL is looking forward to  diversify its operations towards Renewable energy like Solar Power and Clean Energy sources like CMM, CBM, CTL, UCG etc following the directi ves of GoI.
Following to that mission, MoC/CIL is in the process of finalising ' Vision Document 2030 ' to decide on future course of operation for sustainable entity in the nation's energy sector.

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY Conservation of energy always remains a priority area and CIL/Subsidiaries have extensively exercised various measures towards reduction in specific energy consumption.Even though Coal Production has increased by 2.4% in 2017-18 compared to 2016-17, electricity consu mption has reduced to 4605.70 Million Units vis-à-vis 4886.83 Million Units during 2016-17, a reduction of 5.75% in absolute terms.
In  terms of total coal production, Electricity Consumption during 2017-18 was 8.11 kWh/T vis-à-vis 8.82 kWh/T during 2016-17 with a reduction of 8.05%.
However, in terms of composite production, Specific Energy Consumption (kWh/CuM) during 2017-18 was 2.99 kWh/CuM vis-à-vis 3.19  kWh/ CuM during 2016-17 a reduction of 6.27% from previous year.
Some of the salient measures taken by CIL/Subsidiaries for energy conservation are stated below :- z CMPDIL has undertaken energy conservation studies in 2017-18 and carried out Diesel Audit & Benchmarking of specific diesel consumption as well as Electrical Audit & Benchmarking of specific electrical energy consumption in various opencast and underg round mines situated in different subsidiaries of Coal India Limited by BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) accredited Energy Auditors.
Diesel Audit and Benchmarking carried out by CMPDIL in 91 opencast mines in different subsidiary companies of CIL revealed an aggregate saving potential of 17173 kilo litres/year in diesel consumption.
Electrical Audit and Benchmarking carried out in 04 mines (03 opencast mines and 01 underground mine) revealed an aggregate sav ing potential of 42.4 million units/year.
z MoU has been signed between CIL and EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Limited) on 08.02.2016 for implementation of Energy Effici ency Projects in CIL and its Subsidiaries.
Accordingly, high watt luminaries /conventional light fittings are being replaced with low power consuming LEDs of appropriate wattage in majority of the places for street lighting, office and other work places, townships etc., thereby creating huge saving poten tial in electricity consumption.
z Power capacitors of appropriate kVAR rating have been installed to maintain higher power factor and avail maximum benefit on po wer factor incentive from power supply agencies as well as reduction in Maximum Demand.
Almost all the areas of the subsidiaries companies have maintained Power Factor as high as 95% during 2017-18.
Sized Coal being transported through Conveyer Belt and stored i n Coal Stacker to be washed in a Coal Washery 60 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY z Air Conditioners (AC) and Refrigerators of 5 Star Rating have been procured against replacement of old conventional ACs and Refrigerators in different areas of subsidiaries.
z Energy audit of selected projects have been conducted by CMPDIL z In addition to above, some additional measures are being taken by CIL / Subsidiaries for conservation of energy, some of which are as follows:  Auto timer based on-off switches in most of the street lighting, CHPs and township areas to ensure avoiding unnecessary power consumption during odd hours.
 Construction of strata bunkers in underground (UG) mines to eliminate idle running of belt conveyors, thereby saving electricit y.
 Re-organization of LT (Low Tension) overhead line by Aerial Bunched Cable to avoid unauthorized power tapping.
 Monitoring of load pattern and demand side management of supply points limiting maximum demand wherever practicable by staggering avoidable load from peak hours to off-peak hours.
 Re-organizing of dewatering pipelines and reduction of stage pumping as far as practicable.
 Re-organization of power distribution system to minimize distribution loss.
 Laying of cables directly through bore holes for power supply to underground mines to reduce overall length wherever feasible.
The above measures taken for energy conservation are indicative only and not exhaustive.
In addition to above, CIL / Subsidiary Companies are also pursuing use of alternative energy sources.
Various steps have been taken for utilizing solar power as alternate sources of energy, some of which are as stated below : z In kilo-watt scale, roof top solar plants are in successful operation at various places since their commissioning.
Some of thes e operating plants are at Corporate Office of Coal India Ltd, New town, Kolkata (160 kWp), CMPDIL HQ and regional institute (351kWp), different areas of ECL (148kWp), Nagpur and Ballarpur area of WCL (140kWp), HQ office building and Barkakana of CCL (425kWp) etc.

62 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY FOREIGN COLLABORATION Indo-US Collaboration: Status of On-going Projects: a) Development of Coal Preparation Plant Simulator The identified US consultant M/s Sharpe International LLC, USA (SI) was awarded the work in October 2009 for development of a C oal Preparation Plant Simulator.
Total work was split into 18 activities out of which 11 activities were completed and payment to t he tune of 40% value (USD 150,000) had been released in line with provision of the contract.
Later in October 2013, SI expressed their inability to complete the work.
US representatives were requested to take up the matter with Mr. Mark Sharpe of SI for a meaningful concl usion of the project.
US side had advised to contact Mr. Carl Jacobson in this regard.
Consequently, Mr. Carl Jacobson was contacted for submission of a proposal for execution of the project within the framework of existing agreement.
From the perusal of the proposal submitted by him, it was noted that M/s CoalSim was responsible for the development of software based on the mining engineering expertise provided by Mr. Mark Sharpe.
Further, Mr. Manoj Mohanty from Southern Illinois University (SIU) Carbondale, USA vide his email dated 08.01.2016 expressed de sire "to complete the project that SI could not complete".
Mr. Mohanty was requested to submit his proposal through US DoE and MoC, as the project was identified under Indo-US Coal Working Group work plan.
Subsequently, a Proposal from Mr. Mohanty was received through US DoE and MoC, Govt.
of India.
Comments of CMPDI in this regard were sent to Advisor (Projects), MoC on 03.10.16 and a lso to Mr. Smouse Scott of DoE on 27.10.2016.
In response to the queries raised by Dr. Mohanty of SIU (vide e-mail dated 07.11.2016 forwarded by Dr. Scott Smouse of US DOE), suitable reply was sent on 23.11.2016.
On 22.12.2016, Dr. Scott Smouse of US DOE sent the reply as mailed to him by Dr. Mohanty indicating the project direct cost for  the subject assignment with Power Plant economics increased substantially to US$ 3,50,000 + additional 47.5% charge on the project direct cost as research overhead expenses.
CMPDI vide email dated 09.01.2017 requested Dr. Scott Smouse to look into the matter and asked Dr. Mohanty to respond according ly so that the final proposal can be prepared and submitted at the earliest with due consideration to fund limitation as the balan ce fund left in the project is US$ 225,000.
Meanwhile, with special initiative of Dr. Scott Smouse, discussion between the expert team of CM PDI and Dr. Mohanty was held on 11.05.17 on various technical issues for formulation of the revised project proposal.
Dr. Mohanty opine d that he would submit a revised proposal in Sept. 2017 with revised project cost to Dr.
Scout Smouse of US DOE for his review.
The ou tcome of the meeting is to be discussed during the next Indo-US CWG meeting.
In reply to the query on the status of project submission (vide e-mail 25.08.2017), Dr. Mohanty has shown his eagerness (vide e-mail dated 31.08.2017) and desired to involve IIT-ISM, Dhanbad in the project.
Further, Dr. Mohanty vide his email dated 12.09.2017 communicated that the project cost would be USD 400,000+44% overhead cost and also suggested to find somebody else who can complete the project within the recommended budget.
In reply to the above, CMPDI once again requested Dr. Mohanty vide email dated 25.09.2017 and 20.12.2017 to submit the project proposal as per the prescribed format (incorporating the observations of CMPDI on the earlier project proposal as communicated to him vide email dated 07.09.2017) to complete the remaining activities of the project utilizing the balance fund available (i.e.
USD  225,000) in the project.
On confirmation from Dr. Mohanty, appropriate decision can be taken in this regard.
In reply, Dr. Scott Smouse of US, DoE vide his email dated 20.12.2017 suggested some possibilities for further continuation of the project.
The same is under consideration.
b) Cost Effective Technology for Beneficiation and Recovery of Fine Coal US DOE had identified Virginia Tech University (VTU) for establishing an efficient technique for beneficiation & dewatering of Indian coking coal fines through the testing of coal samples in lab and pilot plants at VTU for identification of state-of-the-art tec hnologies based on which a demonstration plant was to be installed in Sudamdih Washery in BCCL.
A joint project proposal was drawn and approved by CIL R&D Board in June, 2008.
The VTU, however, expressed its inability to sign an international agreement and as such the pr oject could not be started.
During the 10th Indo-US CWG meeting in New Delhi on 10.03.2014, US representatives were requested to take up the matter with VT U for meaningful conclusion of the project.
US side had advised to contact Dr. Roe Hoan Yoon of Virginia Tech for further discuss ion in this regard.
Subsequently the issue was taken up with Dr. Roe Hoan Yoon to obtain methodology for execution of the assignment.
Dr. Yoon informed that VTU had developed a Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic Separation (HHS) process for fine Coal Cleaning and would be submitting a proposal on the same.
However, since the project was identified under Indo-US Coal Working Group work plan, Dr. Yo on was requested to route his proposal through US DoE and MoC.
Meanwhile, Shri R. B. Mathur, President, Business Development & Mining Strategy, Virginia Mining Resources Pvt.
Ltd. (VMR), submitted, vide his email dated 09.05.2016, that VMR was a sister concern of Minerals Refining Company (MRC) which is associate d with Dr. Yoon in development of HHS Technology.
He expressed to undertake a pilot project on HHS Technology under S&T Programme in India.
He was requested to submit a proposal with details of the HHS Technology, its availability and cost, etc.
for initiating appropriate action.
Subsequently, a Proposal titled "Application of the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic Separation (HHS) Process for the Beneficiation of I ndian Coals" from M/s MRC was received through US DoE and MoC, Govt.
of India.
Comments of CMPDI on the proposal was sent to Advisor ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 63 (Projects), MoC on 07.10.16 and also to Mr. Smouse Scott of DoE on 27.10.2016.
Further, Shri R.B.
Mathur submitted a revised pr oposal on 21.11.2016 with incorporation of the PROPOSED BUDGET BY TASK, i.e.
the total cost of involvement of US side is USD 1,508,312 as indicated earlier, has been split into different tasks which is related to lab scale testing and consultancy services by the  project proponent.
CMPDI informed Dr. Scott Smouse on 02.12.2016 that the indicated cost mentioned above was towards Laboratory tests o n coal samples (to be transported by CMPDI to Virginia Tech Laboratory in USA), detailed characterization for pilot design, desig n of a POC-scale plant, conceptual design of a Demonstration Plant and developing a flowsheet to Retrofit in existing plant only.
It d oes not include any supply item, not even the cost towards HHS set up required for POC-scale plant, without which the objective of the HHS scheme cannot be accomplished.
Accordingly, Dr. Scott Smouse vide email dated 23.03.2017 submitted a revised proposal as receiv ed from Virginia Minerals Refining Corp. On 18.04.2017, CMPDI responded to Dr. Scott Smouse that Laboratory Tests and Detailed Characterization might be done in India through reputed NABL accredited or Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories to reduce foreign exchange component and each element of POC Scale Design needed suitable justification with detailed elaboration as the cost appeared to be on higher side.
The "Estimate for Building a POC Plant" in the United States also needs to be discussed with US proponent.
During discussion with the expert team of CMPDI on 02.05.17, Pr of.
Roe Hoan Yoon of Virginia Tech University, USA, stressed that initially Indian  coal samples were to be tested on HHS installation in USA to assess the suitability of HHS technology and for this purpose 5 drum fi ne coal samples are required to be transported to USA.
It was clarified that transporting the coal samples to USA and getting tests don e at VTU would incur cost, which will be difficult to arrange before approval of the project by CIL.
Based on further discussions, Mr. Scott Smouse of US DoE & Prof. Yoon of VTU were requested (vide email dated 21.08.2017) to su bmit the revised project proposal incorporating the observation /comments of CMPDI and as per the "Guidelines for implementing coal research projects" issued by MoC.
In response, Mr.
Scout Smouse vide mail dated 13.09.2017 proposed to restrict the Stage-I of the project up to laboratory test work to reduce the project cost.
CMPDI, vide email dated 25.09.2017, indicated that limiting the scope of work to laboratory tests of coal samples would not meet the objective to introduce a state-of-the-art technology in India under  Indo-US bilateral cooperation.
Moreover, it was learnt that M/s Hendricks of USA has developed a 'unique patented technology that refines coal and coal waste into pure hydrocarbon, removing substantially all the mineral matter and water in a novel and exclusive low cost process' and a commercia l plant is expected to be commissioned in USA by May 2018.
Necessary clarification in this regard has been sought from Virginia Tech University (VTU), USA by CMPDI to indicate the difference between the above concept and the methodology proposed by VTU as the above concept appears to be similar with the method proposed by VTU.
Dr. Yoon, vide email dated 27.09.2017, suggested to contact M/s Hendrick s directly to know the technology they are using.
Meanwhile, technical discussion was held at CMPDI Ranchi on 09.11.17 with President (Business Development & Mining Strategy), Virginia Mining Resources Private Ltd. wherein CMPDI communicated its requirement of a revised proposal as per S&T guidelines.
Mr. Scott Smouse of US DoE & Prof. Yoon of VTU were requested to submit revised proposal after incorporating the decisions of the discussion held on 09.11.2017.
Reply from Prof. Yoon of VTU is awaited.

a) Capacity Building for CMPDI Lab  CMPDI has established a state of the art Coal Bed Methane (CBM) lab that can carry out parametric studies for resource estimati on and reservoir characterization for CBM and Shale gas.
 In March 2016, S&T Project titled "Capacity building for extraction of CMM Resource within CIL Command areas" was approved by Ministry of Coal (MoC) under Govt.
of India S&T funding which is jointly implemented by CMPDI and CSIRO.
The project is of three (03) years project duration.
A  Collaborative Understanding agreement for execution of the Project has been signed between CSIRO and CMPDI on 22nd December, 2016.
 CSIRO Project Team visited CMPDI, Moonidih Mine of BCCL and Chinakuri Mine of ECL during 9th -19th May, 2017.
During visit, the team interacted with the project personnel on gassiness issues.
CSIRO team assisted CMPDI to draw the required technical specification of laboratory equipment to be procured by CMPDI for this S&T project.
These equipment are being procured under the S&T funding.
Project personnel were training by CSIRO during 11th - 16th March, 2018 at CMPDI.
b) Ventilation Air Methane (VAM)  CMPDI has formulated a project jointly with CSIRO titled "Abatement and utilization of Ventilation Air Methane (VAM) from working underground degree-III coal mine in India".
The implementing agencies for the project will be CSIRO and CMPDI with BCCL as a sub-implementing agency.
Identified project mine is Moonidih Underground Mine in Jharia coalfield of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL).
 CIL R&D Board has approved the project in principle with 100% retroactive funding at present and in due course 40% should be reimbursed from National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) with directive to reduce duration of project from 42 to 30 months in consultation with CSIRO.
CSIRO has agreed to reduce the project duration to 36 months.
 The revised proposal was placed in the 26th Meeting of R&D Board of CIL held on 27th Dec, 2016 and the Board advised to place the proposal before the Apex Committee with certain modification.
 As per direction of the 26th Meeting of R&D Board of CIL held on 27th Dec, 2016, draft collaborative agreement was submitted by CSIRO which was sent to BCCL on 19th May 2017 for their comments.
The comments received from BCCL was forwarded to CSIRO, Australia vide email dated 22.09.2017 which responded to all the queries made by BCCL.
 BCCL, vide letter dated 01.12.2017, informed that there was no methane gas collection in any well at CBM site, Moonidih.
Locating the VAM test unit at CBM site will require long pipe line to take the VAM to test site.
As such, mine site would have been advantageous over the CBM site.
However, exact location of the VAM test unit is to be identified by CSIRO.
 In reply, vide email dated 04.12.2017, CSIRO stated that 0.2% methane in mine air exhaust may not be sufficient for the study.

DIVERSIFICATION INTO CHEMICALS SECTOR Setting up of Coal to Methanol plant at Dankuni Coal Complex (DCC) Govt.
of India has stressed the need to reduce the crude import bill and take up the measures to cut carbon emissions.
NITI Aayog has prepared an action plan to substitute 10% of crude imports by 2030, by Methanol (CH3OH) alone.
India is shortly going to implement upto 15%  Methanol blending program (M15) with Petrol.
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and Shipping & Waterways has already prepared the dra ft notification on M15 and M100 as transport fuel and is expecting a clearance from Law Ministry to be notified officially.
After announcement of this methanol blending policy, the domestic Methanol business which stood at around 2 MT in 2016-17 is projected to reach to 30 MT i n 2030.
To seize this opportunity, CIL is exploring the possibilities for diversification into Chemicals sector by setting up a new coa l gasification based methanol complex in premises of Dankuni Coal Complex (DCC).
This would also bring a paradigm shift in positioning of its produc t, particularly High CV low ash coal, from an Energy product to a chemical feedstock.
Coal sourced from Ranigunj coalfields shall be gasified to produce syngas which shall be subsequently converted into methanol.
As part of this exercise, potential coal gasification technologies have been shortlisted through a global EOI.
The consultant, M/s PDIL was entrusted to prepare PFR.
M/s PDIL has recommended to set up a coal to methanol complex of 2050 MTPD (0.676 MTPA) capacity in t he available land at DCC.
Currently, the project is under Pre-Feasibility Study stage.

CMPDI is in the process of implementing ISO 14001  & ISO 50001."
15.3 Pollution Control Measures and their Efficacy Coal India has been giving utmost importance to protect environment by practicing and following sustainable mining practices so  as to ensure that the mining operations has least impact on environment.
Various pollution control measures and initiatives are taken up con currently with mining operations for maintaining acceptable/permissible limits of major physical and chemical attributes of environment namely  air, water, hydrogeology, ground vibrations, noise, land & nearby community.
(A) Air Pollution and its Control Measures: To control and reduce dust generation during drilling, blasting, loading and Coal transportation, Coal India Ltd. has taken up various initiatives based on the Environmental Management Plans (EMP) which were already prepared before commencement /enhancement of production of coal mines.
This EMP is prepared keeping in mind the impact on existing environment and forest due to coal mining  projects through Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study of each project.
Crushers, coal transfer points and coal stock areas are being installed.
Mist spray systems have been introduced along conveyor  routes, transfer points and on bunkers.
Mobile water sprinkling has been provided in all the haul roads of OC mines.
In addition to th ese, the projects are enhancing the water sprinkling through engagement of contractual water tankers.
Automatic sprinklers have also bee n installed in CHPs.
Some of the important initiatives are also mentioned below: a) Mobile sprinklers have been installed along haul roads to control dust generated by truck and dumpers movements.
b) Optimum level of loading of coal in trucks and railway wagons to avoid spillage on roads and rail.
c) To avoid spillage of coal during transport, trucks are properly covered by tarpaulin covers.
d) Blacktopping, repairing and strengthening of haul roads are regularly and scientifically carried out.
e) Plantation in surroundings of active mining areas and along the hauls roads are carried out to create green buffers/green bel ts in and around the mines.
f) In order to reduce the dust pollution due to road transportation, eco-friendly mode of transport is being introduced.
Transpo rtation to thermal power stations, who consume more than 80% of thermal coal are carried out by rail / series of belt conveyors.
Rail head s are constructed and made available nearer to mine so as to reduce road transportation.
CIL have constructed / are constructing integrated CHP for rapid loading of wagons and trucks.
g) Tube conveyors mode of transportation is also being introduced in some mines for transportation of coal to thermal power plan ts.
The wall/sides of CHPs are also covered by side cladding with GI Sheet to control pollution at source.
h) To contain dust emission at source itself, dust extractors / wet drilling systems are being undertaken.
i) Controlled blasting and habitation away from the mines have been introduced as far as possible.
j) Modern technologies like Surface Miners and Continuous Miner at different subsidiaries of CIL which generates lesser air born e pollution as compared to conventional mining have been introduced to the system.
During 2017-18, CIL has produced around 48% of total coa l production through surface miners and continuous miners.
k) The quality of Ambient air in and around the mine site is bein g monitored fortnightly.
The required and stipulated numbers of  ambient air quality monitoring stations are maintained, as per environmental rules and regulations of Environment (Protection) Act, 200 6, and its reports are regularly submitted to SPCBs and MoEF&CC.
l) The concept of 'Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations' (CAAQMS) are being introduced and are installed / being i nstalled in large mines of CIL.
Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations have been installed at 4 locations in SECL and 01 location each in WCL and MCL.
(B) Mine Water Management: Water which pumped out from the underground and open cast mines are being contaminated with suspended particles.
Some small qua ntity of water being contaminated during washing and cleaning of HEMM.
CIL also takes initiative by treating this water.
The treated water is being supplied to the local villages after mine consumption, Quality of the final effluent is monitored in terms of the relevant Indi an standards.
z Domestic Effluent Treatment Plant (DETP): The domestic effluent from major residential colonies is treated in DETP either by ac tivated sludge method or by extended aerated lagoons.
z Mine Discharge Treatment Plants (MDTP) are installed in mines for treatment of mine water.
Strata seepage water in mines first gets accumulated in the mine sump which provides for initial settlement of suspended particles.
The supernatant water from the sump is then pumped out on surface and treated in surface sedimentation tank, which provides for second stage settlement.
The treated mine water is then used partly within the mine premises for dust suppression, fire fighting, plantation, washing and further treated as per d rinking water standard for supply to company township and nearby villages through pressure filter / RO.
etc.
After ensuring maximum re-use w ithin and around mine premises the excess treated mine pumped out water is released onto local nalla / streams which is used by the surrounding local population specially for agricultural use.
72 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY z In order to assess the impact of mining activities on ground water, quarterly monitoring of ground water levels is being carrie d out in and around the coal mines covering the buffer zone (i.e.10 Kms radius).
Further, recharging of ground water is also taken up withi n mine premises as well as in nearby villages through rainwater harvesting, digging of ponds/development of lagoons, de-silting of existing ponds/ tanks etc.
z Regular monitoring of mine effluent, workshop effluent, and domestic effluent is carried out every fortnight as per Environment (Protection) Rule - 2006.
Reports of the same are regularly submitted to SPCBs and MOEF.
(C) Noise Pollution Control Measure: For control of noise pollution, following measures are adopted: i) Proper maintenance of equipment to minimize vibration ii) Green belt provided around the mine as well as residential area.
iii) Controlled Blasting & blasting in only day time.
iv) Use of Surface Miner, Continuous Miner & High Wall mining which extract coal without blasting.
v) Ear Muff or Ear Plugs provided to Workers at highly noisy areas (D) Land Reclamation: Reclamation of the mined out areas and the external OB dumps is a major environmental mitigatory activity taken up by Coal Indi a.
In all new mines reclamation of mined out areas are being done as per the Environmental Management Plan and Mine closer plan which are app roved by MoEF&CC.
Back filling of the OB material in the mine voids is part of the mining operation cycle.
Top soil preservation, storin g and use in the plantation areas of the reclaimed areas are being done in the opencast mines wherever necessary.
Concurrent reclamation and reh abilitation of mined out areas (subject to technical feasibility as per geo-mining conditions) are taken for gainful land use.
Opencast mines are filled up with overburden extracted during the process of extraction of coal and after technical reclamation is completed plantation is carrie d out which is termed as biological reclamation.
z Eco-restoration :  For effective Bio- reclamation of disturbed land, scientific studies are carried out to select suitable species of plants for each coalfield and sustainable sequence of reclamation from grass to shrubs, to trees.
Forest Research Institute (FRI) have bee n engaged by CIL for sharing their expertise in the field of eco-restoration in the reclaimed areas.
ECO restoration sites have been developed in BCCL, with technical guidance of FRI. z Eco-park in Reclaimed land : Eco Parks have been developed in many of the mined out areas of CIL like Gunjan Park of ECL, Ananya Vatika of SECL, Nigahi of NCL, Saoner of WCL, Kayakalp Vatika, Rajarappa Eco Park in CCL etc.
z Tree plantation :  Green belt is developed through extensive tree plantation programme every year by the subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd. Avenue plantation, plantation on the OB dumps, plantation around mines, residential colonies, and available government land is undertaken in existing as well as new projects.
Since inception, subsidiary companies of CIL have planted 96 million plants cov ering an area over 38378 Ha.
till March 2018. z Monitoring of Reclamation :  CIL introduced state-of-the-art Satellite Surveillance to monitor land reclamation and restoration for all opencast projects.
The land reclamation and rehabilitation operations are being monitored by Satellite Surveillance.
50 major O CPs excavating more than 5 Mm³ (Coal+OB) per annum are being monitored every year while remaining OCPs excavating less than 5 Mm³ (Coal+OB) per annum are being monitored every 3rd year.
This gives a clear picture of reclamation, which otherwise is difficult  to accurately estimate.
The study during 2017-18 shows that all the major OCPs (excavating > 5 Mm³ (Coal+OB) per annum) have reclaimed area of 61.96% and active mining area is only 38.04% of the total excavated area.
In addition, CIL is conducting vege tation cover mapping through satellite surveillance in every 3 years.
z Mine Closure Plan (MCP) :  MCP is an integral part of the project report prepared by CMPDIL for Coalmines.
This progressive mine closure plan also forms a part of the EIA/EMP prepared and submitted to MOEF for Environmental Clearance.
The progressive reclamation of mined out areas by inbuilt in the project cost and is implemented accordingly.
After exhaustion of reserves, statutory oblig ations in respect of closure are also followed.
CIL is practicing mine closure very effectively.
CIL is committed for restoration of abandoned / mined out areas in a socially acceptable & environment friendly manner.
As on March 2018, out of 453 identified mines, MCPs have alre ady been prepared for all the mines, 445 MCPs have been approved by concern Subsidiary Board and total amount of ` 6075.44 Crores has been deposited in 425 numbers of Escrow accounts.
z Strive for continual improvement in environmental performance by setting targets, measuring progress and taking corrective acti on.
CIL has engaged Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE), Dehradun for Environmental Audit of 20 OC Mines of CIL  which is intended for third party inspection, verification of the existing levels of pollution vis-a-vis the laid down standards and to delineate the compliance status of major projects in addition to the inspection carried out by the statutory authorities like CPCB/SPCB etc.
ICFRE has submitted final draft reports of 19 mines.
Furthermore, CIL has engaged ICFRE for developing approach and methodology for index  rating of environmental conditions for individual mine & preparation of Environmental Performance Index in respect of the EC conditions a nd third party mine auditing of 35 mines of CIL pertaining to Environmental Compliance.
(E) Solar Energy/ Energy efficient Initiative by Coal India Ltd: CIL has signed MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to promote energy efficiency provisions in CIL and its subsid iary companies.
CIL has taken steps for using LED lights substituting CFL lights.
All the electrical fittings of CIL's HQ at Rajarhat, Kolkata have been replaced by energy efficient LED fittings.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 73 To promote, Green Initiatives taken by GoI, CIL has submitted Green Energy Commitment letter to MNRE for developing 1000 MW Solar Power Projects.
For implementation of these projects, CIL has signed MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
In the 1st phase, tender was floated for setting up of 2x100 MW Solar PV Project in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
But, due to do wnward trend in prices of solar projects and availability of land in Madhya Pradesh Solar park, the tenders were cancelled and SECI is in th e process of retendering the same in the state solar park of Madhya Pradesh.
CIL's initiatives had resulted in installation of more than 3 MW capacity in CIL HQ and its Subsidiary Companies.
15.4 Assessment of Impact of Coal Mining in different coalfields CMPDI has introduced satellite surveillance for land reclamation monitoring of all the opencast mines from the year 2008-09.
La nd reclamation monitoring of 50 opencast projects having more than 5 million cu.m.
capacity (coal+OB) and 42 OC projects producing less than 5  million cu.m.
(coal+OB) have been completed based on high resolution satellite data during the year 2017-18.
Monitoring of land reclama tion status in larger capacity mines (>5 million cubic metre) are carried out regularly on annual basis and smaller mines (<5 million cubic  metre) at three years interval.
During 2017-18, seven coalfields, viz.
Rajmahal, Raniganj, Ib-Valley, Mand Raigarh, Sohagpur, Umrer and Pench-Kanhan have been studied for assessing the regional impact of coal mining on land use/vegetation cover.

16.3 Commercial development of Coal Mine Methane (CMM) Ministry of Coal vide Office Memorandum dated 29th July, 2015 has permitted CIL to explore and exploit CBM from its areas under coal mining lease allotted to Coal India Limited (CIL).
Earlier MoC had made CMPDI the Nodal Agency for development of CMM in India.
MoP&NG  vide notification dated 3rd November, 2015 has issued guidelines for  exploration and exploitation of CBM by Coal India Limited (CIL ) and its subsidiaries from areas under coal mining lease allotted to CIL.
74 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY MoC has requested MoP&NG to issue modified guidelines considering exemption of applicability of the ORD Act and PNG Rules withi n coal mining leasehold areas, exemption of penalty in delay in submission of FDP & Production and permission to engage experienced te chnical developers or service contractor from India or abroad as third party for CBM exploitation, etc.
CCEA has given its approval on 11th April, 2018 for issuing a notification amending clause 3(xiii).
Considering Govt.
of India permission to CIL in July, 2015 to explore and exploit CBM from its areas under coal mining lease al lotted to CIL, steps have been taken up by CMPDI/CIL for identification of potential areas initially in Damodar Valley coalfields within CIL m ining leasehold which appears to hold comparatively better potential for CBM.
Accordingly, one block each in Jharia coalfield (in BCCL command  area) and in Raniganj coalfield (ECL command area) have been identified as prospective CBM/CMM blocks: 1) Jharia CMM Block (BCCL Area): A block of about 24.32 sq km clubbing Kapuria, Moonidih, Jarma and Singra blocks has been delineated for commercial development in the mining leasehold area of BCCL having CMM resource of 25.22 BCM.
Project feasibility report ha s been prepared based on Reservoir Modelling & Techno-Economic studies and submitted to BCCL for further perusal.
2) Pre-drainage of coal mine methane at Moonidih mine (BCCL), Jharia Coalfield:  Pre-drainage of methane at Moonidih mine (BCCL) in working Seam XVI has been proposed to recover methane to enhance production and safety and recovered gas may also be gainfully utilized.
In this regard, a Pre-feasibility report on Pre-drainage of CMM from Moonidih UG mine in Jharia Coalfield has been prepared and  submitted to BCCL for competent approval to incorporate Scope of Work for the Global Bid.
An Expression of Interest (EoI) was floated by CMPDI to identify suitable organization to undertake pre-drainage of methane fro m Moonidih mine of BCCL in Jharia Coalfield.
15 responses to the offers were received against this EoI.
Bidder's meet was held on 10th May, 2017 at CMPDI, Ranchi in which 11 respondents of EoI participated which includes Service Provider/Developer from Australia, USA and Poland.
Ba sed on their inputs a draft Tender Specification Document (TSD) was prepared for selection of the suitable experienced developer/service pro vider through global e-Tendering for carrying out the first pilot project in India.
Draft TSD was circulated to respondents and deliberated i n the Pre-NIT meeting held on 7th Sept.'17 at CMPDI, Ranchi.
Accordingly, Global Bid Document has been prepared for "Pre-drainage of Coal Mine Methane (CMM) from Moonidih UG Mine".
The dra ft Global Bid Document has been sent to DGH for "Peer Review" also.
DGH suggested that E&P of CBM in Moonidih mine can be done pur suant to extant Govt.
of India notification dated 3rd Nov.'15 in this regard and CBM/CMM should be sold under the domain of ORD Act 1 948.
BCCL may enter into an agreement with Govt.
of India on lines similar to the CBM contracts, on a nomination basis because it already  holds the coal mining lease.
It was also pointed out for methane drainage at Moonidih UG mine permission from MoP&NG is required in pursuant t o extant Govt.
of India notification dated 3rd Nov.'15.
On approval of the BCCL Board, NIT will be published to invite Global e-tender f or selection of the suitable experienced developer/service provider.
3) Raniganj CMM Block (ECL Area):  An area of about 57 sq km under mining leaseholds of Sripur, Satgram and Kunustoria Areas of ECL in Raniganj Coalfield has been delineated  for commercial development of CMM having CBM resource of 3.93 BCM.
Project feasibili ty report has been prepared based on Reservoir Modelling & Techno-Economic studies and submitted to ECL for further perusal.
Consi dering constraints like Mining lease below Damodar river, limited access of free land & high cost of land required for acquisition, ov erlapping with GEECL, extensive old working above potential coal seam for CBM etc.
it appears that the identified area may be technologically challenging for CBM/CMM extraction.

Specific area in which R&D carried out The Government of India through its Coal Science & Technology (S&T) Plan and Coal India Limited through its R&D Board have been promoting R&D activities in Coal & Lignite Sectors for improvement in production, productivity, safety, quality, coal beneficiation and u tilization, protection of environment and ecology, clean coal technology and allied fields.
Substantial funds are being earmarked annually by the Ministry of Coal and CIL R&D Board to carry out research work on the above subjects in above sectors.
2.
Benefits derived as a result of the above R&D Notable advances have been made through R&D efforts in coal exploration techniques, introduction of mining methods like "blasti ng gallery and cable bolting" for recovery of coal in thick seams and shortwall mining at SECL with an output of more than 1000T per day.
"Controlled blasting" has also been introduced through R&D efforts and is being used now for removal of overburden rocks and coal in openca st mines as close as to 50m from surface structures successfully.
More than 212 Mt of coal so far has been extracted in more than 197 mines by introduction of "Controlled Blasting" which otherwise would have been remained sterilized.
A quantified assessment of roof strata called Rock Mass Rating (RMR) developed under R&D is now being used for designing suppor t in underground mines.
So far, over 907 districts in underground coal mines of CIL have been covered.
A number of research projects have yielded considerable gains in the area of land reclamation after mining and utilization of fly ash.
Humic acid from lignite as a fertilizer in agriculture has shown 35% increase of yield in case of capsicum, tomato crops and also substantial increase in other crops.
This product has been commercialized and is being used by the farmers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Keral a.
A multi institutional funded (UNDP/GEF, CIL and MoC) demonstration research project on "Coal Bed Methane Recovery and Commercia l Utilization" has been successfully concluded at Moonidih underground project, BCCL with encouraging results.
The gas recovered under this project was almost 98% pure methane.
Significant improvement has been achieved in both "coking and non-coking coal washing" and "recovery of fine coals".
Encouraging results have also been obtained from research related to "combustion techniques" for effective utilization of high-ash coals.
Major R&D proj ects on fine coal beneficiation are under implementation through CIL R&D funding.
While some research projects have produced tangible impact on the industry directly, there are others, which have strengthened mine planning, design and technical services required by both operating mines and future mining projects.
A number of research projects have been taken up in the area of environment and ecology to integrate coal mining activities wit h ecological conservation and hazards due to mining.
The findings of these research projects have made a significant impact on the industry resulting in the adoption of proper environment control.
A study was carried on to determine the free silica ( D-Quartz) content present in respirable air borne dust in coal mines and after subsequent analysis in the laboratory, a database software ALPHA-QUARTZ have been developed for va rious parameters including free silica content and other minerals present in respirable air borne dust as well as in coal.
A research project was undertaken to apply the new technique using Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper and ground based Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS).
TLS measurement reduces 75% time and 50% manpower than conventional survey.
The methodology developed is being used for OB measurement.
To ensure the safety of human life and to protect loss of equipment due to collision of dumpers in opencast mines, Dumper Colli sion Avoidance System (DCAS) has been developed indigenously.
The developed system was successfully undertaken at KDH opencast mine of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL).
This three-layer system consists of proximity sensors mounted on dumpers on three sides to detect objects within 10m range, distance and direction information of dumpers present in the vicinity of 100m and also positional information of the dumper through GPRS .
Under the S&T grant of Ministry of Coal, Self-advancing goaf edge (mobile) chock type supports have been indigenously developed and field trial conducted successfully at Bastacola mine of BCCL.
These self-propelled mobile supports of medium duty (2 x 200 Te.)
have closed and extended height range of 1.85 to 3.2 m and can offer support resistance of 71.4 T/ m2.
For safety in underground working, significant progress through R&D work has been made for introduction of modern technique lik e Ground Penetrating Radar for detection of old unapproachable water logged workings.
This new technology provides a major tool for enha ncing safety in underground mines close to water logged workings to avoid disaster due to inundation.
Under an R&D project, the solar photovoltaic plant has been erected and commissioned on the roof tops of CMPDI office buildings .
The total installed capacity of the plant is 190 kW.
Two types of technologies, one with string inverter and another with micro inverter have been adopted in installing the plant.
Under this project, conventional grid (utility supply) clubbed with solar PV system and DG supply through grid interactive inverters to feed to internal grid of CMPDI.
Solar energy produced through the installed plant are being fully utilized by CMPDI as a first preference and rest of the power requirement of CMPDI are being met by conventional sources.
The project efficiently and effectively reduces energy bill of CMPDI, reduces carbon footprint, maximizes renewable energy system, improves power quality, minimizes diesel consumption and in troduced autonomous operation with real time control and monitoring.
The total life of the plant is about 25 years and requires a very l ittle maintenance.

Future R&D efforts will address areas like liquidation of developed pillar in underground mines, pit and dump slope stability i n opencast mines, indigenous development of early warning systems for prediction of dump & highwall failures, CBM from fugitive emissions from op encast mines, in-situ coal gasification, coal liquefaction, and development of predictive models for air quality and pollution etc.
To  address the above, some research projects are now under implementation: (i) Shale gas potentiality evaluation of Damodar basin of India This project is under implementation with an objective to evaluate Damodar basins of India for their shale gas potentiality thr ough integrated geophysical, geological, geochemical and petrophysical investigations.
(ii) Techno-economic Evaluation and performance behavior of Self Advancing (mobile) Goaf Edge Supports (SAGES) The project is under implementation by IIT-ISM, Dhanbad and M/s Jaya Bharat Equipment Pvt.
Ltd. (JBEPL), Hyderabad.
The project  aims at modifications and refurbishment of 6 nos.
of SAGESs, which were designed and fabricated under earlier S&T project and to study their performance behaviour in underground coalmines of SCCL for their techno-feasibility study.
Under this project, the support units, after making necessary modifications, would be subjected to field trial at RK-NT Mine/ R K-5 Mine of SRP Area, SCCL, where the immediate roof is shale/ sandstone to study the performance behaviour and its influence on the ground mov ement and also to study the techno-economic feasibility.
Field trial has been started by deploying the SAGES in the depillaring panel of RK-7 Mine of SCCL.
(iii) Requirement of air in mine for Mass Production Technology.
This project is under implementation by CMPDI, Ranchi.
The aim of this project is optimization of ventilation requirement and a ssessment of minimum infrastructure required for mass production technologies in Indian underground coal mines in order to attain comfortable environment at the working faces considering temperature, heat, humidity and toxic gases, etc.
to boost the coal production from undergroun d mines.
Norms prescribed under Coal Mines Regulation CMR-1957 (Regulation 130) are being followed for maintaining ventilation in all un derground coal mines, where ventilation system designs are being done on the basis of production or largest manpower in a shift.
For mass  production mines, if air requirement is calculated on the basis of production it will be too high or if on the basis of highest manpower a ir requirement is calculated it will be too less as manpower requirement is less in mass production.
Under the proposed study a guideline will be framed for the planning of ventilation requirement for all underground mines, wher e mass production technologies are either deployed or to be deployed in the future.
In addition to the above, assessment will also be done regarding minimum infrastructure required in terms of inclines, shafts, fan drifts, fan capacity, etc.
for a mine where mass production t echnology will be introduced.
(iv) Multiple layer trial blasting for better recovery with less diluted coal.
This project is under implementation by IIT-ISM, Dhanbad & CMPDI, Ranchi.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 163 Under this project, multiple overburden and coal strata can be drilled, loaded with explosives, initiated and blasted in a sing le cycle.
Each layer can be blasted with a unique design and achieve its targeted blast result, which is different from that of the other layers.
Th e blast design in each layer will differ in explosive type and powder factor, inter-hole and inter-row delays, direction of initiation and initiation time, position, which makes this method distinct from conventional blasting.
Using this proposed blasting technology, no throw will be achieved in th e overburden along with reduction of coal losses and pulverisation leading to increased coal seam recovery.
A significant improvement in coa l quality by reducing dilution and coal loss will be achieved through this proposed blasting technique.
Under this project, at least 10 (Ten) trial blasts will be conducted in Jayant of NCL where multiple seams (viz.
Purba top, bot tom and inter- burden) are available.
Holes will be drilled upto 50 m and blasting will be done in a single shot.
The method will allow for fu ll exploitation of the benefits of multiple layer blasting economically, limiting coal damage, dilution and loss.
Productivity will be enhanced by  reducing the drill- blast cycle time through the proposed study.
Blasting near habitation will be possible without much of botheration of the neigh bourhood.
(v)  Studies on the Use of Coal and Petcoke as Fuel in the Cement Industry in India This project is under implementation by IIT-ISM, Dhanbad in association with CMPDI, Ranchi.

However, from services and sp ares point of view, the company is still dependent on the service provider, since such equipment are not yet manufactured in the country and also sufficient number of skilled manpower trained in such category are not available for maintenance of such equipment.
For the first time in India, Free Steered Vehicles for transportation of men and materials in underground have been introduced in Jhanjra mine of ECL.
Other mode  of man- riding system has been commissioned to reduce arduous walking of the miners in several other extensive mines.
Quick setting sto ppings have been constructed in case of fire in underground mines using expansion foam agent.
The latest version of Geovia Minex software for planning of opencast mines has been introduced.
This provides best resource pla nning through pit design, pit optimization, scheduling of resources and dumps, etc.
Surface Miners in several opencast mines have been introd uced to eliminate drilling and blasting and also for facilitating selective mining.
GPRS based tracking of coal transporting vehicles h ave been introduced to prevent theft and pilferage of coal.
RFID based In-Motion Road Weighbridges has ensured Real Time transmission of coal weigh ment data to the Central Server.
This has reduced the chances of fudging of coal production figures on day to day basis.
Numerical modelling software (FLAC 3 D) was procured / upgraded under R & D project title "General/Analysis of Coalfield-wise d atabase of physico-mechanical characteristics of rock/coal and representative numerical models for appropriate solution to strata control problems".
Numerical model by FLAC 3 D software is being regularly used for scientific studies involving strata control.
In-house job/skil l has been created by the use of this software.
Hydrostatic drills with PCD bits for enhancing the productivity of exploratory drills have been introduced.
A project has been taken up in association with NGRI, Hyderabad on "3-D Seismic survey for coal in Belpahar sector of IB valley Coalfield".
The primary object ive is to have exposure in identifying lay and deposition of coal seams in the surveyed area.
R&D project based on Radio-metric sorting technique, which uses X-Ray for separation of impurities from coal  is currently under implementation in Madhuband washery, BCCL.
166 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY The proposed dry beneficiation technology is based on radiometric detection and removal of stones and shale from coal streams a nd works on the differential gamma ray absorption properties of coal and ash forming minerals.
The mass absorption coefficient of coal is d ependent on the chemical composition of coal and shale.
The distinct advantage of radiometric technology is that the target for clean coal or t he threshold value for rejection can be planned and set as per need.
This technology is an efficient, dust free and energy friendly also.
Under this project, it was proposed to take up this technology at demonstration scale.
This project has been executed at Madhub and Washery by installing two modules of ArdeeSort for de-shaling coals in the size fraction of 13mm-50mm (in two stages i.e.13-25mm & 25-5 0mm).

Benefits derived out of technological initiatives undertaken: With the introduction of Mass Production Technology in more number of mines of CIL, fully sized coal is available and safety st andard has increased.
Introduction of Free Steered Vehicles and other mode of Man riding Systems has definitely reduced the travelling tim e and comfort of the workmen, thereby improving the productivity.
(a) Over the years, most optimum sizes of HEMMs are being provisioned for opencast projects of India which are at par with the W orld technology.
To achieve the high production target from large open cast mines, deployment of Electric Rope (ER) shovels of 42 Cu m and dump trucks of 240 T was made during the past years, which is the highest in sizes proposed in India so far.
Use of surface min ers has eliminated drilling and blasting operations in the opencast projects and as such, the problem of working very near to inhabited  areas has been sorted out due to elimination of blasting vibrations.
Moreover, because of possible selective mining, the chances of conta mination of produced coal with extraneous materials has also been minimised.
GPRS based vehicle tracking system has facilitated to monit or the movement of all the coal transportations trucks and any deviation beyond the geo-fenced Area is detected online immediately.
Th is has helped in curbing the pilferage of coal to a large extent.
(b) The average productivity of departmental drills has increased substantially due to introduction of hydrostatic drill.
The ou tcome of project on "3-D Seismic survey for coal" will help in evaluating 3-D seismic technology for coal exploration in Indian scenario and its implementation in CIL.

j) SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT The following system improvements were made by Coal India Limited in 16-17 & 17-18 which were first of its kind and well apprec iated.
It has become an eye opener for other companies to follow.
(1) Letter of Offer for Buyback :   SEBI (Buyback of Securities) Regulations, 1998 stipulates that Letter of Offer along with tender form should be sent to shareholders as on Record Date within 5 working  days from the date of receipt of the SEBI's observations.
Before CIL Buyback Offer, Companies were sending Letter of Offer to all shareholders by Registered Post.
Since CIL shareholders base was around 6.5 lakhs and Letter 182 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY of Offer is around 60 pages, CIL took up the matter with SEBI to permit to send Letter of Offer to those shareholders who have registered their mail-id with the depositories and agreed to accept the communication from the company by electronic means.
Understanding that very less time is available with the company for printing, binding and despatch of Letter of Offer to shareholders, SEBI for the first time had permitted "sending the Letter of Offer through e-mail as a text or as an attachment to email or as a notification providing electronic li nk or Uniform Resource Locator including a read receipt to those shareholders who have their email IDs registered with the depositories.
Howe ver, on receipt of request from any such shareholder to receive a copy of the Letter of Offer in physical format, the same shall be provided.
Besides this, for all those shareholders who do not have their email IDs registered with the company, the Letter of Offer may be sent physically.
The same shall be incorporated in the Letter of Offer".
Hence, Company had sent Letter of Offer and the tender form for Buyback to around 4.15 lakhs shareholders by e-mail thereby saved substantial cost of printing, binding, postal charges and human efforts.
It is understood thereafter SEBI had permitted other companies also to send Letter of Offer under Buyback Regulations by electronic means to those shareholders who were registered their mail-id with their depositories and agreed to accept the same by electronic means.
(2) Direct Transfer of Unclaimed Dividend :  There are some shareholders who do not claim their dividend declared by the company.
As per Section 124(5) of Companies Act 2013, the amount which remained unpaid/unclaimed for a period of 7 years from the date of trans fer to Unpaid dividend account shall be transferred by the company to Investment Education & Protection Fund (IEPF) along with the shares.
Once the amount is transferred to IEPF authorities, no claim shall lie against the company.
However, before transferring the amount, company has to follow IEPF Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules 2016.
In the Stakeholders Relationship Committee Meeting it was decided to obtain updated beneficiary details from NSDL and CDSL for the unclaimed dividend, match the data on dp-id, client id, name and bank account no.
and through dividend banker directly transfer the amount to shareholders account.
For the Interim and Final Dividend 2010-11, company through its RTA matched the data and directly tran sferred Rs.26.87 lakhs for 9029 shareholders and Rs.2.26 Lakhs for 7145 shareholders respectively thereby substantially reduced the unc laimed dividend amount to be transferred to IEPF authorities.
This has come as a great relief to those small shareholders who had received the money through direct transfer or else they have to go through the cumbersome process of applying to IEPF authorities to claim their u nclaimed amount and shares.
We understand from RTA that this is the first time any company in India had undertaken this exercise thereby substantially reduced the unclaimed dividend amount transfer to IEPF.
Other companies may also follow the same procedure for reducing the unclaimed dividend amount which will give big relief to small shareholders.
(3) Preparation of Software for unclaimed Dividend :  Section 124(2) of Companies Act 2013 stipulates that the amount of unclaimed dividend transferred to unpaid dividend account should be uploaded in the website of the company as well as MCA website within 90 days of transfer with all other details.
CIL had already uploaded the details dividend-wise from 2010-11 onwards.
In the Stakeholders Relationship Committee, it was advised that company should develop a software thereby either by providing D p-id, Client id or PAN, the shareholder can get the details of all unclaimed dividend, instead of searching individual unclaimed dividend file and claim the amount from the company before it is transferred to IEPF.
Company through its RTA developed such software and with the approval of Stakeholders Relationship Committee, BETA Version of software was uploaded in CIL website.
It is also being updated at quart erly intervals.
By using this software, the shareholders can find out unclaimed dividend, dividend-wise without going through the cumbersome process of searching individual file and claim the same from the company before it is transferred to IEPF.

The energy security of the country and its prosperity are integrally linked to efficient and effective use of its most abundant, affordable and depend ent fuel, coal.
In terms of availability, coal is one is the most abundant fossil fuel in India.
The geological reserves of coal in India are i n excess of 315 Billion Tonnes.
At the current rate of production, the reserves are adequate to meet the demand in the foreseeable future.
Even conside ring only the proved reserves and incremental growth in the coal production (from the current level), the reserves will be adequate to meet c oal demand for over a century.
In terms of need of coal, while Government of India has made unprecedented success in village and rural household electrificati on in the last four (4) years, there are still 32 million rural households which are yet to be electrified (14% of total rural household).
Ass uming 5 individuals per household, there are still more than 150 million Indians who are yet to get access to clean, cheap and sustainable electric ity.
The number will be still higher if quality of power, hours of supply, urban households, etc.
are taken in to account.
Coal is the key fuel  for electricity generation in India.
Coal based installed capacity forms 57% of the total installed capacity.
In terms of electricity generatio n, the share of coal based capacity is still the highest (around 70%).
Though the proportion of non-coal sources, particularly renewables, has incre ased over the last few years, coal remains the dominant fuel for electricity generation in India.
Going forward, while it is accepted that the pro portion of renewables in the overall generation mix will increase, coal based generation will continue to be the key driver of the nation’ s energy wheels and is expected to grow in absolute terms.
Today India is the third largest producer of coal in the world producing about 676 Mt.
of coal (2017-18) which is in complete s ync with our development needs.
The coal sector in India is primarily driven by State owned companies including Coal India Limited and Singareni Collieries Company Limited.
Participation of private sector companies in coal mining in India, till recent past, was limited to production  for captive purposes.
Under captive mining, significant resources have been allocated to government and private sector entities (in total, 89 coal blocks).
However, the production from captive segment is yet to increase to significant levels.
The Government, in a major reform in the  sector, has approved participation of private sector companies in coal mining for sale of coal (commercial mining).
The detailed scheme and  allotment of coal blocks (vide auction) is under formulation.
This is another step towards creation of a dynamic and competitive coal market  in India.
Coal India Limited (CIL) is the single largest coal producing company in the world, with a total production of 567.36 million t onnes during the fiscal 2017-18.
It accounted for 84% of total coal produced in India during the year.
It is a Maharatna Company, listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
CIL is with the holding company having seven wholly-owned coal producing subsidiaries and one mine planning and consultancy sub sidiary.
CIL’s operations spread across 9 states in India.
CIL also has a wholly owned foreign subsidiary company in Mozambique register ed as ‘Coal India Africana Limitada’.

in 2018-19 of which 80% of the said production would be consumed by power sector on ly.
Comparatively, in 2017-18, the total coal supplied by CIL was 580.3 MT.
The target for the current year is higher by 3.5% than the actual coal supply in the year 2017-18.
CIL’s growth plan for the future is in synergy with the ambitious plan of the Government for 24 X 7  power supply to all homes in the country.
Though a roadmap to achieve more than 908 Mt of coal production by 2019-20 was prepared, due to a combination of factors like sluggish industry growth, change in energy mix, environmental challenges and land acquisition, the time frame f or reaching the said goal has been shifted to 2025-26.
Sustainability of such growth by minimizing the environmental impact being a major issue, thrust is laid in qualitative improve ment in coal production through selective mining, beneficiation & blending and diversifying into clean coal technologies.
The targeted growth in coal production would also call for developing matching logistics infrastructure.
Apart from creating ne w infrastructure, optimum utilization of existing capacity through a dynamic process of source rationalization is another key area of activity.
B y means of launching linkage auction scheme, an in-built system of source rationalization has already been put in place for non-regulated sector.
Further, it has been envisaged to encourage dispatch of coal to consumers within 20 Km.
by belt closed conveyor and within 40 Km.
by MGR .
This may help provide additional rakes for long distance transport of coal.
CIL is also exploring opportunities to diversify coal to chemical business.
This is to ensure greater value addition and thereby improving financial performance of the company and ensuring long term sustenance.
CIL has planned a capital investment of Rs 9500 Crs for maintaining its volume growth in 2018-19.
In addition, the company has also envisaged for investing substantial amount in different schemes in 2018-19 such as development of railway infrastructure project, solar p ower, pit head power plants, surface coal gasification, Coal Bed Methane (CBM), revival of fertilizer plants etc.
Company Underground Opencast Total 2017-18 2016-17 2017-18 2016-17 2017-18 2016-17 198 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY In line with the envisaged growth in production, CIL has envisaged an investment of ` 31540 Crs for developing of railway infrastructure projects.
The Tori-Shivpur line upto Balumath in Jharkhand was commissioned and operationalised on 9 th Mar’18 and from Balurmath to Bukru engine trial run was done on 28th May’18.
The Jharsuguda-Barapali line in Odisha upto Sardega has been commissioned and operationalised on 5th Apr’18.
Further, CIL plans to significantly ramp up its investment programme in next five years also.
Marketing Outlook: The Working Group on Coal and Lignite, during the process of formulation of XII Plan document in 2011, projected a widening gap  between demand and indigenous availability to the tune of 273 Mt by 2021-22.
Accordingly, CIL was mandated to produce 908 Mt coal produ ction by the year 2019-20.
It may be noted that the achievement of 908 Mt production was contingent on coordinated effort of CIL and MoC at one hand, and coal bearing states and other Ministries such as Railways & MoEF CC on the other hand, to access the resources and speed up  logistics for coal evacuation.
Subsequent to the change in environmental paradigm and coal demand, an urgent need was felt for revisiting the  908 Mt programme.
In 2017, Ministry of coal through Coal India Limited appointed an independent agency to formulate Vision up to 2030 for the Indian coal sector and as part of it, assess the coal demand – supply scenario for the country and the coal demand on CIL (Coal Vision 2030).
As per the study, in view of lower than expected growth in coal demand (under the 1 BT plan) and growth from alternate energy sources, CIL  may have a target of lower supply in the near future.
In the study, the demand estimates have been undertaken under three scenarios - Pess imistic, Base case and Optimistic.
While the estimates for pessimistic and base case are on the basis of GDP growth of 7%, the optimistic case pre sumes GDP growth rate of 8% and additional demand from alternate uses of coal.Under the estimated base case scenario, the projected deman d of coal for the current year is likely to be about 220 MT and in the optimistic scenario the projected demand is about 954 MT.
Accordingly,  the projected CIL share of coal production for the year is 652 MT in both the scenarios.
Similarly, during the year 2023-24 the estimated base case projected demand of coal is about 1005 MT and in the optimistic scen ario the projected demand is about 1208 MT.
Correspondingly, the projected CIL share of coal production for the year is estimated to be of the level of 720 & 923 MT in the base case & optimistic scenario respectively.
Further, as per the study, the estimated demand projections for the year 2029-30 shall be about 1318 MT & 1747 MT in the base c ase & optimistic scenario respectively.
Correspondingly, the projected CIL share of coal production for the year is estimated to be of the level of 897 & 1326 MT in the base case & optimistic scenario respectively.
CIL has also taken an initiative to build matching logistics infrastructure to ensure evacuation of planned quantity of product ion.
The following activities have already been initiated to augment rail evacuation capacity: i) CIL has undertaken major Railway Infrastructure Projects, implemented either by Railways on deposit basis or JV Companies formed between the Indian Railway represented by IRCON, Subsidiary Company and concerned State Government.
ii) The two major Railway Infrastructure Projects on deposit basis are: - (a) Tori Shivpur New BG Line - This railway line caters to North Karanpura Area of CCL and it is planned to evacuate about 32 MT Y of coal once the line comes through in the state of Jharkhand.
It is expected to be completed in March’2019.
(b) Jharsuguda–Barpali–Sardega Rail Link relates to the Basundhara coalfields of MCL and the envisaged capacity evacuation is 70  MTY of coal from MCL.It was completed on 5 th April’2018.
iii) The three major railway infrastructure projects being undertaken by JV mode are as follows: (a) East Rail Corridor and East West Rail Corridor are planned for evacuation of coal of Mand- Raigarh and Korba – Gevra Coal- f ields of SECL respectively by Rail JVs CERL & CEWRL in the state of Chhattisgarh.
East Corridor Phase I(Single track) is expected to be completed in Sep’19 and Phase II (Single track) is March’22.
East West Corridor is expected to be completed in March’22.
In all, about 180 MTY of coal shall be evacuated through these two corridors.
(b) The Shivpur-Kathautia rail connectivity is envisaged to be executed by Rail JV, JCRL (Jharkhand Coal Railway Limited) formed among CCL (Central Coalfields Limited), Govt of Jharkhand and Indian Railway represented by IRCON, in the state of Jharkhand.
It is expected to be completed in Jan’2022.
About 30 MTY coal from the mines of CCL is planned to be evacuated through this line.
(c) MCRL (Mahanadi Coal Railway Limited) has been formed among MCL (Mahanadi Coalfields Limited), Govt.
of Odisha and Indian Railway represented by IRCON, for creating rail infrastructure in the state of Odisha.
The work has been taken up in two phases : 1st PHASE Angul –Balram- Jarpada-Tentuloi link at Talcher Coal field of MCL (69.10 KM) which consists of  Jharpada – Kalinga- Angul link (14.22 Km).
It is expected to be completed in Sep’19.
2nd PHASE Tentuloi- Budhapank –   as phase - II (136 KM approx.)
About 60 MTY of coal from MCL is envisaged to be evacuated from these rail lines and decongest as well as systemize the coal evacuation of the region.
The Government has introduced a policy titled ‘Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India (SHAKTI )’ on 22.05.2017 to provide long term coal linkage to various segments of power producers.
Allocation of coal under SHAKTI to some se gments of power producers has already been made and the process of allocation of linkages to other segments is under process.
Besides, th e platform for transparent allocation of long term linkage to non-regulated sectors and Spot and Forward e-Auction schemes for meeting the ter m and seasonal coal requirement for different consuming sectors, are continuing.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 199 Customer satisfaction through quality assurance is another key area for improvement.
Following initiatives are identified towar ds quality improvement and assurance: i.
Supply of (-) 100 mm sized coal to power sector consumers wef.
1 st Jan’16.
ii.
Third party sampling facility extended to all sectors and schemes.
In order to promote transparency with commitment for supp ly of good quality coal, Third Party sampling through independent agencies was introduced for various categories of consumers.
Initially, this facility was provided to Power Sector under FSA/ MOU for which CSIR-CIMFR has been jointly engaged by CIL and Power Utilities as the Thi rd Party Agency.
Further, Third Party Sampling was extended to Power consumers taking coal under Special Forward e-Auction Scheme and non-regula ted sector taking coal under Linkage Auction.
Subsequently, in terms of decision by CIL Board in its 353rd meeting held on 18/19.12.17, facility of independent Third Party Sampling was extended for other remaining schemes viz.
Spot/ Special Spot e-Auction scheme, Exclusiv e e- Auction Scheme for non-Power consumers as well as Non-Power sector FSAs (in addition to those executed under Linkage Auction ro ute) & State nominated Agencies drawing coal through FSAs.
For all these schemes, IIT-ISM and QCI were nominated as Independent Thir d Party sampling agencies.
As of now, Power Sector as well as Non-Power Sector consumers drawing coal under all the schemes are eligible to avail transparent third party sampling arrangement.
iii.
All major laboratories acr oss the subsidiaries of coal companies are now equipped with the Automatic “Bomb Calorimeter” for ascertaining calorific value iv.
NABL accreditation of field level laboratories (43 labs are NABL accredited out of 55 labs selected).
Operations Outlook: As on date 114 Ongoing projects having 548.43 Mty ultimate capacity and sanctioned capital of ` 63480.43 Crs are under various stages of implementation.
For achieving production target in 2018-19, 28 EC proposals for EC capacity of 211.614 MTPA with incremental ca pacity of 106.012 MTPA are under process at different stages.
In FY 18-19, Stage-I FC is required for 22 proposals involving 5818.69 Ha and Stage-II FC is required for 16 proposals involvin g 2374.10 Ha forest land to commensurate with coal production target.
In terms of land acquisition requirements, 2707.91 Ha land to be taken into possession by the subsidiaries of CIL for achieving target in 2018-19.
The expansion program will be managed in a structured manner with the help of IT enabled solutions.
The implementation of ERP s olution to enable transparency in operations, maintenance and support functions is under consideration.
The project implementation of vita l mines is being monitored using MS Project software.
The Company has already concluded a study through reputed consultant for mechanization and automation level across a substantia l number of mines.
This is aimed at identification of opportunities in mine planning, exploration, survey, operations and maintenance.
To support increase in production on a sustainable basis, synergic growth in exploration is absolutely necessary.
Increased use  of hydrostatic drilling with PCD bits and 2D Seismic Survey Technology to achieve high rate in exploration have been envisaged.
CIL will conti nue to focus on increasing its reserve base in India.
CIL is in the process of augmenting the capacity of training institutes across subsidiaries, including IICM.
Several other actions for building human resource capacity are being contemplated in collaboration with reputed institutions.
Outlook regarding Evolution of the Ecosystem: CIL’s projected coal production in the coming years will be materialized only by working closely with other stakeholders.
These  include the Indian Railways, State Governments, Regulators, Community and other market participants.
CIL’s initiatives towards this endeavo r are as below: 1.
MCL has formed a SPV, Mahanadi Basin Power Limited (MBPL), with 100% stake held by MCL for power generation capacity of 2X800 MW through pit-head Power Plant at Basundhara Coalfields.
2.
To promote, Green Initiatives taken by GoI, CIL has submitted Green Energy Commitment letter to MNRE for developing 1000 MW S olar Power Projects.
For implementation of these projects, CIL has signed MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
In the 1st phase, tender was floated for setting up of 2x100 MW Solar PV Project in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
But, due to do wnward trend in prices of solar projects and availability of land in Madhya Pradesh Solar Park, the tenders were cancelled and SECI is in th e process of re- tendering of above projects in state Solar Parks of Madhya Pradesh.
CIL and its subsidiary companies have installed more than 3 MW ground mounted and roof top Solar Projects.
Further, CIL is also  exploring various opportunities for development of Solar power projects to meet the requirement of ‘Net Zero’ energy company by 2020.
In addition to above, CIL has a mandate to commission a total of 3000 MW of solar photo-voltaic power project to meet the requi rement of the ‘Net Zero’ energy company.
CIL has already executed a MoU with SECI to construct a 1000 MW solar project for CIL.
For the balance 2000 MW, CIL is exploring various opportunities like searching JV partner to execute solar projects in JV mode.
Recently, CIL has held a  meeting with NLC India Limited (A Govt.
of India undertaking under the Ministry of Coal) to venture into solar power so as to meet the ‘Net Zero ’ energy requirement of CIL.
NLC on their part have shown interest to execute the solar power project for CIL.
200 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY Further CIL has initiated formation of a JV with IOCL for ensuring uninterrupted supply of bulk explosives for its mines on lon g term basis.
CIL has consistently face disruption of supply of explosives from manufacturers resulting in loss of production and revenue.
This i nitiative is likely to reduce the dependence of CIL on private explosive manufacturers who at times were cartelizing the market and benefit CIL by ensuring the supply security, assured quality product with timely supply, efficient distribution and meeting future growth in demands.

7.0 DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The Consolidated financial statements of CIL, hereinafter referred as “company”, have been prepared in accordance with Indian A ccounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.
A detailed discussion on financial performance and analysis is furnished below.
A.
Total Income: Total Income of the Company comprises Revenue from operations and other Income.
Major revenue of the company from the above two  heads of total income includes income from sale of coal, other operating revenue such as loading and transportation charges recovered  from customers, Evacuation Facility Charges, Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works, consultancy and other services related to mine planning ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 201 & designing, interest earned on investments such as term deposits with banks, dividend income from mutual funds etc.
The total income for financial Year 2017-18 is `91926.89 crore as against `89322.94 crore in the previous year registering an increase of 2.92%.
The breakups of major elements of income are discussed below:        ( ` in crore) Note: With effect from 01.07.2017 excise duty on coal was subsumed in GST 1) Revenue from Operations: (i) Sale of Coal Sales are presented as gross sales and net of various statutory levies comprising royalty, GST,GST Compensation Cess, Cess on Coal, Central Sales Tax, Stowing Excise Duty, Clean Energy Cess, Sales Tax, Additional Royalties relating to National Mineral Exploration Trust (NM ET), District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and other levies etc.
but excluding Excise Duty (following the clarification issued by SEBI the Excise  Duty is to be included in revenue from operations and therefore to be shown as an item of expenditure).
Excise duty therefore has been shown as a part of Gross/Net Sales.
The Income from sale of coal is mainly dependent on the pricing and production of coal and distribution thereo f. It may be noted that excise duty is subsumed in GST w.e.f 01.07.2017.
The gross sales of the company which exceeded the landmark figure of Rs.
One Lac crore in year 2015-16 stood at `127162.17 Crores in 2017- 18 against the previous year gross sales of `122286.96 crore.
The Net sales (net of all levies including Excise Duty) for the year was `81729.46 crore against the previous year figure of `75602.86 crore, thereby registering a growth of 8.10%.
During the year the offtake increased to 580.28 million tonne from 543.32 million tonne in previous year, registering a growth over 6.80%.
The increase in volume accounted for the growth in sales revenue.
During the year the pit head Run of Mine prices of all grades of non-coking coal has been revised w.e.f 00.00 Hour of 9 th January, 2018.
In view of re-gradation of large number of mines w.e.f.
April, 2017, which was carried out as an annual exercise, the average sale s price realisations showed downward trend in the first three Quarters as compared to the previous year.
However, post such price ratio nalization and higher realization from E-auction sales in the Fourth Quarter, the average sales price realisations started improving.
E-au ction sales accounts for about 18% of total volume of offtake.
The total average sales realization was `1408 per tonne in current year as against `1397 per tonne in previous year.
The combined effect of increase in volume, improvement in average sales realization etc.
resulted in increase in net sales (net  of all levies including Excise Duty) of `6126.60 crore.
Government of India has introduced Goods and Services tax (GST) w.e.f 1 st July 2017.
The rate of GST on coal is 5%.
Further GST has subsumed earlier indirect levies viz.
Central Excise Duty, Central Sales Tax, VAT etc.
Stowing Excise Duty has also been done away with.
The taxes subsumed in GST, which were earlier levied on coal was around 11-12%.
Even though Clean Energy Cess of `400 per tonne was also repealed w.e.f 01.07.17, a new levy viz.
GST Compensation Cess of `400 per tonne was introduced by The Goods and Services tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 w.e.f.
01.07.17.
(ii) Other Operating Revenue: Loading and additional transportation charges Major element of other operating revenue is on account of transportation charges recovered from the customers.
The company char ges transportation costs for transportation of coal to dispatch points.
During the year such surface transportation charges were re vised by the subsidiary companies for all the existing lead distances including 0-3 kilometers, which hitherto were not charged.
The revised  charges were based on weighted average transportation cost of the respective lead distance of the subsidiary company plus 10%.
Similarly siz ing charges and rapid loading silo charges, etc.
were also revised up during the year.
The loading and transportation charges recovered (net of all levies including Excise Duty) during the year was `2980.60 crores against `2490.91 crores in the previous year.
Evacuation Facility Charges W.e.f.
20th Dec 2017, the company introduced a charge of `50 per tonne as ‘Evacuation Facility Charges’ on all despatches except dispatch through rapid loading arrangement.
During the year, a sum of `743.57 crore (net of levies) was realized by the company on account of such levy.
Particulars FY 2017-18 FY 2016-17 Change % Sale of Coal 127162.17 122286.96 3.99% Less: Statutory Levies 44056.04 41240.33 6.83% Less: Excise Duty 1376.67 5443.77 – 74.71% Net Sales 81729.46 75602.86 8.10% Other Operating Revenue (Net) 4162.44 2952.10 41.00% Revenue from Operations 85891.90 78554.96 9.34% Other Income 4658.32 5324.21 – 12.51% Total Income 90550.22 83879.17 7.95% 202 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works Other operating revenue includes Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works amounting to `80.79 crores (PY `126.84 crores) received from Govt.
of India.
Stowing Excise Duty leviable on coal sales was repealed with introduction of GST from 01.07.2017.
The Subsidy f or sand stowing & protective works accounted for during the year relates to the period prior to 01.07.2017.
Revenue from services Revenue from services includes consultancy and other services provided by CMPDIL, a subsidiary of CIL to parties outside the CI L’s group.
Revenue from services which also forms part of other operating revenue has improved significantly from `190.60 crores (net of levies) in 2016- 17 to `328.02 crores (net of levies) in 2017-18.
2) Other Income Other income primarily includes Interest income from Deposits with Banks, Dividend from Mutual Funds, rental income, profit on sale of assets, other miscellaneous incomes etc.
Write back of provisions and liabilities made in earlier years which are no longer required a re also considered in other income.
During the year other income declined by 12.51% from `5324.21 crore in FY 2016-17 to `4658.32 crore in FY 2017-18 mainly owing to lower earnings from interest on bank deposits.
The interest earning on bank deposits declined by `725.20 crore, from `2767.30 Crore in FY 2016-17 to `2042.10 Crore in FY 2017-18.

2.3   Revenue recognition 2.3.1  Revenue from sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; (b) the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; (c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (d) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; and (e) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes, levies or duties collected on behalf of the government/ other statutory bodies.
Advances received from the customers are reported as customer’s deposits unless the above conditions for revenue recognition ar e met.
228 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY However, based on the educational material on Ind AS 18 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Company has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the Company on its own account.
This is for the reason that it is a liability of the manu facturer which forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the goods are sold or not.
Since the recovery of excise duty flows to t he Company on its own account, gross revenue includes excise duty.
However, other taxes, levies or duties are not considered to be received by the Company on its own account and are excluded from net revenue.
2.3.2   Interest Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.
2.3.3   Dividend Dividend income from investments is recognised when the rights to receive payment is established.
2.3.4  Other Claims Other claims (including interest on delayed realization from customers) are accounted for, when there is certainty of realisati on and can be measured reliably.
2.3.5  Rendering of Services When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the tr ansaction is recognised with reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.
The outcome of a tr ansaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; (c) the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and (d) the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
2.4 Grants from Government Government Grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attac hed to them and that there is reasonable certainty that grants will be received.
Government grants are recognised in Statement of Profit & Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the company reco gnises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Government Grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on systematic basis over the useful life of asset.
Grants related to income (i.e.
grant related to other than assets) are presented as part of statement of profit and loss under the head ‘Other Income’.
A government grant/assistance that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpos e of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs, is recognised in profit or loss of the period i n which it becomes receivable.
The Government grants or grants in the nature of promoter’s contribution are recognised directly in “Capital Reserve” which for ms part of the “Shareholders fund”.
2.5 Leases A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
Title ma y or may not eventually be transferred.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
2.5.1  Company as a lessee A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.
2.5.1.1  Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease  term.
2.5.1.2  Operating lease - Lease payments under an operating lease is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless either: (a) another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the payments to the lessor s are not on that basis; or (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s  expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary because of factors other than general inflation, then this condition is not met.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 229 2.5.2    Company as a lessor 2.5.2.1 Operating leases Lease income from operating leases (excluding amounts for services such as insurance and maintenance) is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless either: (a) another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the leased asset is di minished, even if the payments to the lessors are not on that basis; or (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s  expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary according to factors other than inflation, then this condition is n ot met.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased as set and recognised as an expense over the initial lease term on the same basis as lease income.
2.5.2.2  Finance leases Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investme nt outstanding in respect of the lease.
2.6 Non-current assets held for sale The Company classifies non-current assets and (or disposal groups) as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use.
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that signi ficant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the sale expected within one year from the date of classification.
For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange ha s commercial substance.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or disposal group is available fo r immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale i s highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned.
The Company treats sale of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when: ¾ The appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), ¾ An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated ¾ The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair  value, ¾ The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, and ¾ Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely those significant changes to the plan will be made or that t he plan will be withdrawn.
2.7 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Land is carried at historical cost.
Historical cost includes expenditure which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the land like, rehabilitation expenses, resettlement cost and compensation in lieu of employment incurred for concerned displaced persons etc.
After recognition, an item of all other Property, plant and equipment are carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation  and any accumulated impairment losses under Cost Model.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises: (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.
(b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operat ing in the manner intended by management.
(c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which the Company incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.
Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item depreciated separately.
However, significant part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful life and depreciation method are grouped together in determin ing the depreciation charge.
Costs of the day to-day servicing described as for the ‘repairs and maintenance’ are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the same are incurred.
Subsequent cost of replacing parts significant in relation to the total cost of an item of property, plant and equipment are re cognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company;  and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition policy mentioned below.
When major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company; and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the prev ious inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognise d. An item of Property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from the  continued use of assets.
Any gain or loss arising on such derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in profi t and Loss.
230 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, is provided as per cost model on straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows: Other Land (incl.
Leasehold Land) : Life of the project or lease term whichever is lower Building : 3-60 years Roads : 3-10 years Telecommunication : 3-9 years Railway Sidings : 15 years Plant and Equipment : 5-15 years Computers and Laptops : 3 Years Office equipment : 3-6 years Furniture and Fixtures : 10 years Vehicles : 8-10 years Based on technical evaluation, the management believes that the useful lives given above best represents the period over which the management expects to use the asset.
Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different from useful lives as prescribed under Part C of  schedule II of Companies act, 2013.
The estimated useful life of the assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year.
The residual value of Property, plant and equipment is considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset except some items of assets such as, Coal tub, winding ropes, haulage ropes, stowing pipes & safety lamps etc.
for which the technically estimated useful life has been d etermined to be one year with nil residual value.
Depreciation on the assets added / disposed of during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month of add ition / disposal.
Value of “Other Land” includes land acquired under Coal Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA) Act, 1957, Land Acquisit ion Act, 1894, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013, Lo ng term transfer of government land etc., which is amortised on the basis of the balance life of the project; and in case of Leasehold land such amortisation is based on lease period or balance life of the project whichever is lower.
Fully depreciated assets, retired from active use are disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its residual value under P roperty, plant Equipment and are tested for impairment.
Capital Expenses incurred by the company on construction/development of certain assets which are essential for production, supp ly of goods or for the access to any existing Assets of the company are recognised as Enabling Assets under Property, Plant and Equipment.
2.8 Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation The company’s obligation for land reclamation and decommissioning of structures consists of spending at both surface and underg round mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India.
The company estimates its obligation for Mine Clo sure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning based upon detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of the future  cash spending to perform the required work.Mine Closure expenditure is provided as per approved Mine Closure Plan.
The estimates of expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
T he company records a corresponding asset associated with the liability for final reclamation and mine closure.
The obligation and corresponding assets are recognised in the period in which the liability is incurred.
The asset representing the total site restoration cost (as estimated by Centr al Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per mine closure plan is recognised as a separate item in PPE and amortised over the balance proje ct/mine life.
The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an expense recog nised as financial expenses.
Further, a specific escrow fund account is maintained for this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.
The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis forming part of the total mine closure obligation is initi ally recognised as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn after t he concurrence of the certifying agency.
2.9 Exploration and Evaluation Assets Exploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalised costs which are attributable to the search for coal and related resource s, pending the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource which comprises  inter alia the following: z acquisition of rights to explore z researching and analysing historical exploration data; z gathering exploration data through topographical, geo chemical and geo physical studies; z exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling; ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 231 z determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource; z surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; z Conducting market and finance studies.
The above includes employee remuneration, cost of materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.
As the intangible component represents an insignificant/indistinguishable portion of the overall expected tangible costs to be incurred and recouped from future exploitation, these costs along with other capitalised exploration costs are recorded as exploration and e valuation asset.
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised on a project by project basis pending determination of technical feasibility a nd commercial viability of the project and disclosed as a separate line item under non-current assets.
They are subsequently measured at cost  less accumulated impairment/provision.
Once proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are trans ferred to “Development” under capital work in progress.
However, if proved reserves are not determined, the exploration and evaluation as set is derecognised.
2.10 Development Expenditure When proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation cost  is recognised as assets under construction and disclosed as a component of capital work in progress under the head “Development”.
All subsequ ent development expenditure is also capitalised.
The development expenditure capitalised is net of proceeds from the sale of coal e xtracted during the development phase.
Commercial Operation The project/mines are brought to revenue; when commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield production on a sustainable basi s is established either on the basis of conditions specifically stated in the project report or on the basis of the following criteria: (a) From beginning of the financial year immediately after the year in which the project achieves physical output of 25% of rate d capacity as per approved project report, or (b) 2 years of touching of coal, or (c) From the beginning of the financial year in which the value of production is more than total, expenses.
Whichever event occurs first; On being brought to revenue, the assets under capital work in progress are reclassified as a component of property, plant and e quipment under the nomenclature “Other Mining Infrastructure”.
Other Mining Infrastructure are amortised from the year when the mine is brough t under revenue in 20 years or working life of the project whichever is less.
2.11 Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any a ccumulated amortisation (calculated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised.
Instead, the related expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful live s of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economi c lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisat ion method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in the expecte d useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite l ives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each reporting date.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proce eds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss Exploration and Evaluation assets attributable to blocks identified for sale or proposed to be sold to outside agencies (i.e.
for blocks not earmarked for CIL) are however, classified as Intangible Assets and tested for impairment.
Cost of Software recognized as intangible asset, is amortised on straight line method over a period of legal right to use or th ree years, whichever is less; with a nil residual value.
2.12 Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets) The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does  not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the recoverable amount is de termined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.Company considers individual mines as separate cash generating units for th e purpose of test of impairment.
232 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.13 Investment Property Property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather th an for, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or sale in the ordinary course of businesses are clas sified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs.
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
2.14 Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
2.14.1  Financial assets 2.14.1  Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through  profit or loss, plus transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trad e date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
2.14.2  Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: z Debt instruments at amortised cost z Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) z Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) z Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 2.14.2.1  Debt instruments at amortised cost A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integr al part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.
2.14.2.2  Debt instrument at FVTOCI A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, a nd b) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value.
Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI).
However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.
On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to P&L.
Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.
2.14.2.3  Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments.
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.
However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred t o as ‘accounting mismatch’).
The Company has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
2.14.2.4  Equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and Joint Ventures In accordance of Ind AS 101 (First time adoption of Ind AS), the carrying amount of these investments as per previous GAAP as o n the date of transition was considered to be the deemed cost.
Subsequently Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are me asured at cost.
2.14.2.5  Other Equity Investment All other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 233 For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequ ent changes in the fair value.
The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis.
The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI.
There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to P&L even on sale of investment.
However, the Company ma y transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
2.14.2.6 Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primari ly derecognised (i.e.
removed from the balance sheet) when: z The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or z The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received ca sh flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transf erred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all  the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement,  it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantial ly all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the  extent of the Company’s continuing involvement.
In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum  amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.
2.14.2.7 Impairment of financial assets(other than fair value) In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairme nt loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 17 d) Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 11 and Ind AS 18 The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on: z  Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; and z  All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind AS 17 The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk.
Rather, it recognises impa irment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
2.14.3 Financial liabilities 2.14.3.1 Initial recognition and measurement The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
2.14.3.2 Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 2.14.3.3 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabili ties designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incur red for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that ar e not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as h eld for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in OCI.
These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L.
However, the Company may transfer the cu mulative gain or loss within equity.
All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Th e Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
234 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.14.3.4 Financial liabilities at amortised cost After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains an d losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of  the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
This category generally applies to borrowings.
2.14.3.5 Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an ex isting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability a re substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a n ew liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, shall be recognised in profit or loss.
2.14.4 Reclassification of financial assets The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition.
After initial recognition, no  reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities.
For financial assets which are debt instrumen ts, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets.
Changes to the business model are expected t o be infrequent.
The Company’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are s ignificant to the Company’s operations.
Such changes are evident to external parties.
A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations.
If Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies th e reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the chan ge in business model.
The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
The following table shows various reclassification and how they are accounted for Original classification Revised classification Accounting treatment Amortised cost FVTPL Fair value is measured at reclassification date.
Difference between previous amortized cost and fair value is recognised in P&L.
FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying amount.
EIR is calculated based on the new gross carrying amount.
Amortised cost FVTOCI Fair value is measured at reclassification date.
Difference between previous amortised cost and fair value is recognised in OCI.
No change in EIR due to reclassification.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new amortised cost carrying amount.
However, cumulative gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value.
Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new carrying amount.
No other adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be measured at fair value.
Cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to P&L at the reclassification date.
2.14.5  Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there  is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.14.6   Cash & Cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original matur ity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement o f cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the company’s cash management.
2.15   Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs are expensed as and when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets i.e.
the assets that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use, in wh ich case they are capitalised as part of the cost of those asset up to the date when the qualifying asset is ready for its intended use.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 235 2.16  Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.
Taxab le profit differs from “profit before income tax” as reported in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes i tems of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting perio d. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally reco gnised for all deductible temporary difference to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those de ductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or  from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the ta xable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary  differences.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is  no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised defe rred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting year and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that sufficient taxab le profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liabili ty is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting perio d. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which  the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other compre hensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly i n equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect i s included in the accounting for the business combination.
2.17 Employee Benefits 2.17.1   Short-term Benefits All short term employee benefits are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.
2.17.2   Post-employment benefits and other long term employee benefits 2.17.2.1  Defined contributions plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan for Provident fund and Pension under which the company pays fixed contribution into fund maintained by a separate statutory body (Coal Mines Provident Fund) constituted under an enactment of law and the company will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are rec ognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
2.17.2.2   Defined benefits plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
Gratuity, leave encashment are  defined benefit plans (with ceilings on benefits).
The company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return of their service in the current and prior periods.
The benefit is discounted to de termine its present value and reduced by the fair value of plan assets, if any.
The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of India n Government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the company’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The application of actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rate, expected rates of return on assets, fut ure salary increases, mortality rates etc.
Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to uncertainties.
The ca lculation is performed at each balance sheet by an actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in to the be nefit to the company, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refu nds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the company if it is realisable during th e life of the plan, or on settlement of plan liabilities.
Re-measurement of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gain and losses considering  the return on plan a ssets (excluding interest) and the effects of the assets ceiling (if any, excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the other comprehens ive income.
The company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
N et interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit and loss.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recog nised as expense immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
236 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.17.3 Other Employee benefits Certain other employee benefits namely benefit on account of LTA, LTC, Life Cover scheme, Group personal Accident insurance sch eme, settlement allowance, post-retirement medical benefit scheme and compensation to dependents of deceased in mine accidents etc.,  are also recognised on the same basis as described above for defined benefits plan.
These benefits do not have specific funding.
2.18   Foreign Currency The company’s reported currency and the functional currency for majority of its operations is in Indian Rupees (INR) being the principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reported currency of the company using the exchange rate prevailing a t the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the end of the reporting period are tran slated at the exchange rates prevailing as at the end of reporting period.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities or on translating monetary assets and liabilities at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency are valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of transactions.
2.19   Stripping Activity Expense/Adjustment In case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on the top of coal seam is required to be removed to get access to the coal and its extraction.
This waste removal activity is known as ‘Stripping’.In opencast mines, th e company has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine (as technically estimated).
Therefore, as a policy, in the mines with rated capacity of one million tonnes per annum and above, cost of Stripping is charge d on technically evaluated average stripping ratio (OB:COAL) at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance ac count after the mines are brought to revenue.
Net of balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as Stripping Activity Adjustm ent under the head Non - Current Assets/ Non-Current Provisions as the case may be.
The reported quantity of overburden as per record is considered in calculating the ratio for OBR accounting where the variance between reported quantity and measured quantity is within the lower of the two alternative permissible limits, as detailed hereunder :- Annual Quantum of Permissible limits of variance OBR of the Mine II I % Quantum (in Mill.
Cu.
Mtr.)
Less than 1 Mill.
CUM +/- 5% 0.03 Between 1 and 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 3% 0.20 More than 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 2% However, where the variance is beyond the permissible limits as above, the measured quantity is considered.
In case of mines with rated capacity of less than one million tonne, the above policy is not applied and actual cost of strippi ng activity incurred during the year is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.20 Inventories 2.20.1    Stock of Coal Inventories of coal/coke are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventories are calculated using the Fir st in First out method.Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs nec essary to make the sale.
Book stock of coal is considered in the accounts where the variance between book stock and measured stock is upto +/- 5% and in  cases where the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured stock is considered.
Such stock are valued at net realisable value or cost whi chever is lower.
Coke is considered as a part of stock of coal.
Coal & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value and considered as a part of stock of coal.
Slurry (coking/semi-coking), middling of washeries,are valued at net realisable value and considered as a part of stock of coal.
2.20.2    Stores & Spares The Stock of stores & spare parts (which also includes loose tools) at central & area stores are considered as per balances app earing in priced stores ledger and are valued at cost calculated on the basis of weighted average method.
The inventory of stores & spare parts lying at collieries / sub-stores / drilling camps/ consuming centres are considered at the yearend only as per physically verified stores and are v alued at cost.
Provisions are made at the rate of 100% for unserviceable, damaged and obsolete stores and spares and at the rate of 50% for stores & spares not moved for 5 years.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 237 2.20.3   Other Inventories Workshop jobs including work-in-progress are valued at cost.
Stock of press jobs (including work in progress) and stationary at  printing press and medicines at central hospital are valued at cost.
However, Stock of stationery (other than lying at printing press), bricks, sand, medicine (except at Central Hospitals), aircra ft spares and scraps are not considered in inventory considering their value not being significant.
2.21    Provisions, Contingent Liabilities &Contingent Assets Provisions are recognized when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it  is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expenditure expected to settle the oblig ation.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the  obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Possible obligations, wh ose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain events not wholly within the control of t he company, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Contingent Assets are not recognised in the financial statements.
However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain,  then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.
2.22   Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outs tanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per shares is computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity s hares considered for deriving basic earnings per shares and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon c onversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.23   Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, judgements and ass umptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Application of accountin g policies involving complex and subjective judgements and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimate are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and, if materia l, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
2.23.1   Judgements In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: 2.23.1.1 Formulation of Accounting Policies Accounting policies are formulated in a manner that result in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information  about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply.
Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.
In the absence of an Ind AS that specifically applies to a transaction, other event or condition, management has used its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is: a) relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and b) reliable in that financial statements: (i) represent faithfully the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company; (ii) reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form; (iii) are neutral, i.e.
free from bias; (iv) are prudent; and (v) are complete in all material respects on a consistent basis.
In making the judgement management refers to, and considers the applicability of, the following sources in descending order: (a) the requirements in Ind ASs dealing with similar and related issues; and (b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Framework .
In making the judgement, management considers the most recent pronouncements of International Accounting Standards Board and in  absence thereof those of the other standard-setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards, oth er accounting literature and accepted industry practices, to the extent that these do not conflict with the sources in above paragraph.
The Company operates in the mining sector (a sector where the exploration, evaluation, development production phases are based on the varied topographical and geomining terrain spread over the lease period running over decades and prone to constant changes), the accou nting policies whereof have evolved based on specific industry practices supported by research committees and approved by the various regulato rs owing to its consistent application over the last several decades.
In the absence of specific accounting literature, guidance and standa rds in certain specific areas which are in the process of evolution.
The Company continues to strive to develop accounting policies in line with the de velopment of accounting literature and any development therein shall be accounted for prospectively as per the procedure laid down above mor e particularly in Ind AS 8.
The financial statements are prepared on going concern basis using accrual basis of accounting.
238 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.23.1.2 Materiality Ind AS applies to items which are material.
Management uses judgement in deciding whether individual items or groups of item ar e material in the financial statements.
Materiality is judged by reference to the size and nature of the item.
The deciding factor is whether  omission or misstatement could individually or collectively influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements.
Management also uses judgement of materiality for determining the compliance requirement of the Ind AS.
In particular circumsta nces either the nature or the amount of an item or aggregate of items could be the determining factor.
Further the Company may also be required  to present separately immaterial items when required by law.
2.23.1.3 Operating lease Company has entered into lease agreements.
The Company has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of th e arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the commercial property and the fair  value of the asset, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operat ing leases.
2.23.2 Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a si gnificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described b elow.
The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond t he control of the Company.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
2.23.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets There is an indication of impairment if, the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount,  which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Company considers individual mines as separate cash generating u nits for the purpose of test of impairment.
The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget for th e next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Company is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well as  the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
These estimates are most relevant to other mining infr astructures.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, are disclosed and further explained in respect ive notes.
2.23.2.2 Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
2.23.2.3 Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment medical benefits and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual d evelopments in the future.
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates.
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to  changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate.
In  determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in curre ncies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables of the country.
Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes.
Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rate.
2.23.2.4 Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using generally accepted valuation techniques including the DCF model.
The inputs to thes e models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair values.
Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk, volatility and other relevant input /considera tions.
Changes in assumptions and estimates about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
2.23.2.5 Intangible asset under development The  Company capitalises intangible asset under development for a project in accordance with the accounting policy.
Initial cap italisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a project repor t is formulated and approved.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 239 2.23.2.6 Provision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation In determining the fair value of the provision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation, assumptions a nd estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of site restoration and dismantling and the expected timing of those costs.
The Company estimates provision using the DCF method considering life of the project/mine based on — ¾ Estimated cost per hectare as specified in guidelines issued by ministry of Coal, Government of India ¾ The discount rate (pre tax rate) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to t he liability.

(b) Fair value hierarchy Table below shows judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are (a) recognized and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortized cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.
Financial assets and liabilities  31 st March, 2018 31 st March,2017 measured at fair value Level I Level II Level III Level I Level II Level III Financial Assets at FVTPL Investments : -- - -- - Mutual Fund 26.06 - - 60.19 - - Financial Liabilities -- - -- - If any item - - - - - - (` in Crore) 266 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY A brief of each level is given below.
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.
This includes Mutual fund which is valued using  closing NAV.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which  maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant inputs requir ed to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
This i s the case for unlisted equity securities, preference shares borrowings, security deposits and other liabilities taken included in level 3.
(c) Valuation technique used in determining fair value Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include the use of quoted market prices of instruments.
(d) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs At present there are no fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs.
(e) Fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost ¾ The carrying amounts of trade receivables, short term deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
¾ The Company considers that the Security Deposits does not include a significant financing component.
The milestone payments (security deposits) coincide with the company’s performance and the contract requires amounts to be retained for reasons other than the provision of finance.
The withholding of a specified percentage of each milestone payment is intended to protect the interest of the company, from the contractor failing to adequately complete its obligations under the contract.
Accordingly, transaction cost of Security deposit is considered as fair value at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Significant estimates: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques.
The Company uses its judgment to select a method and makes suitable assumptions at the end of each reporting period.
Financial assets and liabilities 31 st March, 2018 31 st March 2017 measured at amortised cost for which fair values are disclosed at 31st March, 2018 LevelI Level II Level III LevelI Level II Level III Financial Assets Investments: Preference Shares -- 1913.13 -- 1913.13- Equity Component 3713.94 3438.84- Debt Component Other Investments -- -- Loans -- 2.28 -- 1209.43 Deposits & receivable -- 4214.31 -- 3804.63 Trade receivables -- 0.27 -- 12.74 Cash & cash equivalents -- 345.25 -- 725.17 Other Bank Balances -- 142.83 -- 196.92 Financial Liabilities Borrowings -- -- Trade payables -- 111.16 -- 110.00 Security Deposit and -- 334.04 -- 57.86 Earnest money Other Liabilities -- 836.51 -- 717.28 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 267 The Company risk management is carried out by the board of directors as per DPE guidelines issued by Government of India.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management as well as policies covering investment of excess liquidity.
A.
Credit Risk:  Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, investments carried at amortised cost and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as including outstanding receivables.
Credit risk management: Receivables arise mainly out of sale of Coal.
Sale of Coal is broadly categorized as sale through fuel supply agreements (FSAs)  and e-auction.
Macro - economic information (such as regulatory changes) is incorporated as part of the fuel supply agreements (FSAs) and e-au ction terms Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) As contemplated in and in accordance with the terms of the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP), the company enters into legally  enforceable FSAs with customers or with State Nominated Agencies that in turn enters into appropriate distribution arrangements with end cu stomers.
Our FSAs can be broadly categorized into: • FSAs with customers in the power utilities sector, including State power utilities, private power utilities (“PPUs”) and indep endent power producers (“IPPs”); • FSAs with customers in non-power industries (including captive power plants (“CPPs”)); and • FSAs with State Nominated Agencies.
E-Auction Scheme The E-Auction scheme of coal has been introduced to provide access to coal for customers who were not able to source their coal  requirement through the available institutional mechanisms under the NCDP for various reasons, for example, due to a less than full allocat ion of their normative requirement under NCDP, seasonality of their coal requirement and limited requirement of coal that does not warrant a  long-term linkage.
The quantity of coal to be offered under E-Auction is reviewed from time to time by the Ministry of Coal.
Expected credit loss:  The Company provides for expected credit risk loss for doubtful/ credit impaired assets, by lifetime expected credit losses (Simplified approach).
Expected Credit losses for trade receivables under simplified approach.

Note 2 : SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1 Basis of preparation of financial statements The financial statements of the Company (CIL Consolidated) have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (I nd AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.
The financial statements have been prepared on historical costbasis of measurement, except for ¾ certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy on financial instruments in para 2.15) ; ¾ Defined benefit plans- plan assets measured at fair value; ¾ Inventories at Cost or NRV whichever is lower (refer accounting policy in para no.
2.21).
2.1.1 Rounding of amounts Amounts in these financial statements have, unless otherwise indicated, have been rounded off to ‘rupees in crore’upto two deci mal points.
2.2 Basis of consolidation 2.2.1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has control.
The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company.
They are decon solidated from the date when control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Company.
The Company combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of ass ets, liabilities, equity, cash flows, income and expenses.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group  companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses between group companies are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an im pairment of the transferred asset.
All the companies within the CIL Consolidated normally uses accounting policies as adopted by the CIL Co nsolidated for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
In case of significant deviations of a particular constituent company within CIL Consolidated, appropriate adjustments are made to the financial statement of such constituent company to ensure conformity with the CIL Conso lidated accounting policies.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.
2.2.2 Associates Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but no control or joint control.
This is generally  the case where the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost, ex cept when the investment, or a portion thereof, classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted in accordance with Ind AS 105.
The Company impairs its net investment in the associates on the basis of objective evidence.
2.2.3 Joint arrangements Joint arrangements are those arrangements where the Company is having joint control with one or more other parties.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement which exist only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint Arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures.
The classification depends on the contractual r ights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
292 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.2.4 Joint Operations Joint operations are those joint arrangements whereby the Company is having rights to the assets and obligations for the liabil ities relating to the arrangements.
Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the appropriate head ings.
2.2.5 Joint ventures Joint ventures are those joint arrangements whereby the Company is having rights to the net assets of the arrangements.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the consolid ated balance sheet.
Investments in Joint venture are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognized at cost,  except when the investment, or a portion thereof, classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted in accordance with Ind AS 105.
The Company impairs its net investment in the joint venture on the basis of objective evidence.
2.2.6 Equity method Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the Company’s share of other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income.
Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reductio n in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Company’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including an y other unsecured long-term receivables, the Company does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made paym ents on behalf of the other entity.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interest in these entities.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the  policies adopted by the Company.
2.2.7 Changes in ownership interests The Company treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equ ity owners of the Company.
A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-contro lling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling i nterests and any fair value of consideration paid or received is recognised within equity When the Company ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or signi ficant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, join t venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are acc ounted for as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained,  only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
2.3 Current and non-current Classification The Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet based on current/ non-current classification.
An asset is trea ted as current by the Company when: (a) it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in its normal operating cycle; (b) it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading; (c) it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or (d) the asset is cash or a cash equivalent (as defined in Ind AS 7) unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is treated as current by the Company when: (a) it expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle; (b) it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading; (c) the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or (d) it does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments  do not affect its classification.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 293 2.4 Revenue recognition 2.4.1 Revenue from sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; (b) the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold; (c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (d) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; and (e) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes, levies or duties collected on behalf of the government/ other statutory bodies.
Advances received from the customers are reported as customer’s deposits unless the above conditions for revenue recognition ar e met.
However, based on the educational material on Ind AS 18 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Company has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the Company on its own account.
This is for the reason that it is a liability of the manu facturer which forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the goods are sold or not.
Since the recovery of excise duty flows to t he Company on its own account, gross revenue includes excise duty.
However, other taxes, levies or duties are not considered to be received by the Company on its own account and are excluded from net revenue.
2.4.2 Interest Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.
2.4.3 Dividend Dividend income from investments is recognised when the rights to receive payment is established.
2.4.4 Other Claims Other claims (including interest on delayed realization from customers) are accounted for, when there is certainty of realisati on and can be measured reliably.
2.4.5 Rendering of Services When the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue associated with the tr ansaction is recognised with reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period.
The outcome of a tr ansaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; (c) the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and (d) the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
2.5 Grants from Government Government Grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attac hed to them and that there is reasonable certainty that grants will be received.
Government grants are recognised in Statement of Profit & Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the company reco gnises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Government Grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on systematic basis over the useful life of asset.
Grants related to income (i.e.
grant related to other than assets) are presented as part of statement of profit and loss under the head ‘Other Income’.
A government grant/assistance that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpos e of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs, is recognised in profit or loss of the period i n which it becomes receivable.
The Government grants or grants in the nature of promoter’s contribution should be recognised directly in “Capital Reserve” whi ch forms part of the “Shareholders fund”.
2.6 Leases A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
Title ma y or may not eventually be transferred.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
294 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.6.1 Company as a lessee A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.
2.6.1.1 Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to q ualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease  term.
2.6.1.2 Operating lease - Lease payments under an operating lease is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless either: (a) another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the payments to the lessor s are not on that basis; or (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary because of factors other than general inflation, then this condition is not met.
2.6.2 Company as a lessor Operating leases : Lease income from operating leases (excluding amounts for services such as insurance and maintenance) is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless either: (a) another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished, even if the payments to the lessors are not on that basis; or (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary according to factors other than inflation, then this condition is not met.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased as set and recognised as an expense over the initial lease term on the same basis as lease income.
Finance leases : Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the Company’s net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outst anding in respect of the lease.
2.7 Non-current assets held for sale The Company classifies non-current assets and (or disposal groups) as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use.
Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that signi ficant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the sale expected within one year from the date of classification.
For these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the exchange ha s commercial substance.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only when the assets or disposal group is available fo r immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale i s highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned.
The Company treats sale of the asset or disposal group to be highly probable when: ¾ The appropriate level of management is committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), ¾ An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated ¾ The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair  value, ¾ The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, and ¾ Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely those significant changes to the plan will be made or that t he plan will be withdrawn.
2.8 Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) Land is carried at historical cost.
Historical cost includes expenditure which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the land like, rehabilitation expenses, resettlement cost and compensation in lieu of employment incurred for concerned displaced persons etc.
After recognition, an item of all other Property, plant and equipment are carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation  and any accumulated impairment losses under Cost Model.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises: (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.
(b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operat ing in the manner intended by management.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 295 (c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the ob ligation for which the Company incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular perio d for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.
Each part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item depreciated separately.
However, significant part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful life and depreciation method are grouped together in determin ing the depreciation charge.
Costs of the day to-day servicing described as for the ‘repairs and maintenance’ are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which the same are incurred.
Subsequent cost of replacing parts significant in relation to the total cost of an item of property, plant and equipment are re cognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company;  and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition policy mentioned below.
When major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company; and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the prev ious inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognise d. An item of Property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from the  continued use of assets.
Any gain or loss arising on such derecognition of an item of property plant and equipment is recognised in profi t and Loss.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, except freehold land, is provided as per cost model on straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows: Other  Land (incl.
Leasehold Land) : Life of the project or lease term whichever is lower Building : 3-60 years Roads : 3-10 years Telecommunication : 3-9 years Railway Sidings : 15 years Plant and Equipment : 5-15 years Computers and Laptops : 3 Years Office equipment : 3-6 years Furniture and Fixtures : 10 years Vehicles : 8-10 years Based on technical evaluation, the management believes that the useful lives given above best represents the period over which the management expects to use the asset.
Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different from useful lives as prescribed under Part C of  schedule II of companies act, 2013.
The estimated useful life of the assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year.
The residual value of Property, plant and equipment is considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset except some items of assets such as, Coal tub, winding ropes, haulage ropes, stowing pipes & safety lamps etc.
for which the technically estimated useful life has been d etermined to be one year with nil residual value.
Depreciation on the assets added / disposed of during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the month of add ition / disposal.
Value of “Other Land” includes land acquired under Coal Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA) Act, 1957, Land Acquisit ion Act, 1894, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013, Lo ng term transfer of government land etc., which is amortised on the basis of the balance life of the project; and in case of Leasehold land such amortisation is based on lease period or balance life of the project whichever is lower.
Fully depreciated assets, retired from active use are disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its residual value under P roperty, plant Equipment and are tested for impairment.
Capital Expenses incurred by the company on construction/development of certain assets which are essential for production, supp ly of goods or for the access to any existing Assets of the company are recognised as Enabling Assets under Property, Plant and Equipment.
Transition to Ind AS The company elected to continue with the carrying value as per cost model (for all of its property, plant and equipment as reco gnised in the financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP.
296 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.9 Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation The company’s obligation for land reclamation and decommissioning of structures consists of spending at both surface and underg round mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India.
The company estimates its obligation for Mine Clo sure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning based upon detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of the future  cash spending to perform the required work.Mine Closure expenditure is provided as per approved Mine Closure Plan.
The estimates of expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
T he company records a corresponding asset associated with the liability for final reclamation and mine closure.
The obligation and corresponding assets are recognised in the period in which the liability is incurred.
The asset representing the total site restoration cost (as estimated by Centr al Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per mine closure plan is recognised as a separate item in PPE and amortised over the balance proje ct/mine life.
The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an expense recog nised as financial expenses.
Further, a specific escrow fund account is maintained for this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.
The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis forming part of the total mine closure obligation is initi ally recognised as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn after t he concurrence of the certifying agency.
2.10 Exploration and Evaluation Assets Exploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalised costs which are attributable to the search for coal and related resource s, pending the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource which comprises int er alia the following: z acquisition of rights to explore; z researching and analysing historical exploration data; z gathering exploration data through topographical, geo chemical and geo physical studies; z exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling; z determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource; z surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; z Conducting market and finance studies.
The above includes employee remuneration, cost of materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.
As the intangible component represents an insignificant/indistinguishable portion of the overall expected tangible costs to be incurred and recouped from future exploitation, these costs along with other capitalised exploration costs are recorded as exploration and e valuation asset.
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised on a project by project basis pending determination of technical feasibility a nd commercial viability of the project and disclosed as a separate line item under non-current assets.
They are subsequently measured at cost  less accumulated impairment/provision.
Once proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are trans ferred to “Development” under capital work in progress.
However, if proved reserves are not determined, the exploration and evaluation as set is derecognised.
2.11 Development Expenditure When proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation cost  is recognised as assets under construction and disclosed as a component of capital work in progress under the head “Development”.
All subsequ ent development expenditure is also capitalised.
The development expenditure capitalised is net of proceeds from the sale of coal e xtracted during the development phase.
Commercial Operation The project/mines are brought to revenue; when commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield production on a sustainable basi s is established either on the basis of conditions specifically stated in the project report or on the basis of the following criteria: (a) From beginning of the financial year immediately after the year in which the project achieves physical output of 25% of rate d capacity as per approved project report, or (b) 2 years of touching of coal, or (c) From the beginning of the financial year in which the value of production is more than total expenses.
Whichever event occur s first; On being brought to revenue, the assets under capital work in progress are reclassified as a component of property, plant and e quipment under the nomenclature “Other Mining Infrastructure”.
Other Mining Infrastructure are amortised from the year when the mine is brough t under revenue in 20 years or working life of the project whichever is less.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 297 2.12 Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any a ccumulated amortisation (calculated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised.
Instead, the related expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful live s of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economi c lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisat ion method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in the expecte d useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite l ives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised but is tested for impairment at each reporting date.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proce eds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss Exploration and Evaluation assets attributable to blocks identified for sale or proposed to be sold to outside agencies (i.e.
for blocks not earmarked for CIL) are however, classified as Intangible Assets and tested for impairment.
Cost of Software recognized as intangible asset, is amortised on straight line method over a period of legal right to use or th ree years, whichever is less; with a nil residual value.
2.13 Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets) The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal, and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does  not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which case the recoverable amount is de termined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Company considers individual mines as separate cash generating units for t he purpose of test of impairment.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.14 Investment Property Property (land or a building or part of a buildingor both) held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather tha n for, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or sale in the ordinary course of businesses are clas sified as investment property.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs .
Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
2.15 Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
2.15.1 Financial assets 2.15.1 Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through  profit or loss, plus transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trad e date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
2.15.2 Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: z Debt instruments at amortised cost.
z Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
z Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
z Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).
298 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.15.2.1 Debt instruments at amortised cost A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integr al part of the EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss.
The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.
2.15.2.2 Debt instrument at FVTOCI A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, a nd b) The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value.
Fair value movements are recognized in the other comprehensive income (OCI).
However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.
On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to P&L.
Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.
2.15.2.3 Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments.
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.
However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred t o as ‘accounting mismatch’).
The Company has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.
Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
2.15.2.4 Equity investments in subsidiaries, associates and Joint Ventures In accordance of Ind AS 101 (First time adoption of Ind AS), the carrying amount of these investments as per previous GAAP as o n the date of transition is considered to be the deemed cost.
Subsequently Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are mea sured at cost.
In case of consolidated financial statement, Equity investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted as per equity me thod as prescribed in para 10 of Ind AS 28.
2.15.2.5 Other Equity Investment All other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequ ent changes in the fair value.
The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI.
There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to P&L even on sale of investment.
However, the Company ma y transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the P&L.
2.15.2.6 Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primari ly derecognised (i.e.
removed from the balance sheet) when: z  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or z The Companyhas transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cas h flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Companyhas transfe rred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Companyhas neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement,  it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantial ly all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the  extent of the ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 299 Company’s continuing involvement.
In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability.
The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum  amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.
2.15.2.7 Impairment of financial assets (other than fair value) In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Companyapplies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairmen t loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance, b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI, c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 17, d) Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 11 and Ind AS 18.
The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on: z  Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables; and z  All lease receivables resulting from transactions within the scope of Ind AS 17 The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk.
Rather, it recognises impa irment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
2.15.3 Financial liabilities 2.15.3.1 Initial recognition and measurement The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
2.15.3.2 Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 2.15.3.3 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabili ties designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incur red for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that ar e not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as h eld for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the in itial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in OCI.
These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L.
However, the Companymay transfer the cum ulative gain or loss within equity.
All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Th e Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
2.15.3.4 Financial liabilities at amortised cost After initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains an d losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of  the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
This category generally applies to borrowings.
2.15.3.5 Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an ex isting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability a re substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a n ew liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, shall be recognised in profit or loss.
300 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.15.4 Reclassification of financial assets The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition.
After initial recognition, no  reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities.
For financial assets which are debt instrumen ts, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets.
Changes to the business model are expected t o be infrequent.
The Company’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are s ignificant to the Company’s operations.
Such changes are evident to external parties.
A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations.
If Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies th e reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the chan ge in business model.
The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
The following table shows various reclassification and how they are accounted for : Original Revised Accounting treatment classification classification Amortised cost FVTPL Fair value is measured at reclassification date.
Difference between previous amortized cost and fair value is recognised in P&L.
FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new gross carrying amount.
EIR is calculated based on the new gross carrying amount.
Amortised cost FVTOCI Fair value is measured at reclassification date.
Difference between previous amortised cost and fair value is recognised in OCI.
No change in EIR due to reclassification.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new amortised cost carrying amount.
However, cumulative gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value.
Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had always been measured at amortised cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassification date becomes its new carrying amount.
No other adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be measured at fair value.
Cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to P&L at the reclassification date.
2.15.5 Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there  is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.15.6 Cash & Cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original matur ity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement o f cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the company’s cash management .
2.16.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs are expensed as and when incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets i.e.
the assets that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use, in wh ich case they are capitalised as part of the cost of those asset up to the date when the qualifying asset is ready for its intended use.
2.17 Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.
Taxab le profit differs from “profit before income tax” as reported in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes i tems of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting perio d. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally reco gnised for all deductible temporary difference to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those de ductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or  from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the ta xable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and assoc iates, except where the company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such inves tments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 301 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is  no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting year and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liabili ty is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting perio d. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which  the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other compre hensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly i n equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect i s included in the accounting for the business combination.
2.18 Employee Benefits 2.18.1 Short-term Benefits All short term employee benefits are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.
2.18.2 Post-employment benefits and other long term employee benefits 2.18.2.1 Defined contributions plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan for Provident fund and Pension under which the company pays fixed contribution into fund maintained by a separate statutory body (Coal Mines Provident Fund) constituted under an enactment of law and the company will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are rec ognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
2.18.2.2 Defined benefits plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
Gratuity, leave encashment are  defined benefit plans (with ceilings on benefits).
The company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return of their service in the current and prior periods.
The benefit is discounted to de termine its present value and reduced by the fair value of plan assets, if any.
The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of India n Government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the company’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The application of actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rate, expected rates of return on assets, fut ure salary increases, mortality rates etc.
Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to uncertainties.
The ca lculation is performed at each balance sheet by an actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in to the be nefit to the company, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refu nds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the company if it is realisable during th e life of the plan, or on settlement of plan liabilities.
Re-measurement of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gain and losses considering  the return on plan a ssets (excluding interest) and the effects of the assets ceiling (if any, excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the other comprehens ive income.
The company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.
N et interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit and loss.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recog nised as expense immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
2.18.3 Other Employee benefits Certain other employee benefits namely benefit on account of LTA, LTC, Life Cover scheme, Group personal Accident insurance sch eme, settlement allowance, post-retirement medical benefit scheme and compensation to dependents of deceased in mine accidents etc.,  are also recognised on the same basis as described above for defined benefits plan.
These benefits do not have specific funding.
2.19 Foreign Currency The company’s reported currency and the functional currency for majority of its operations is in Indian Rupees (INR) being the principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reported currency of the company using the exchange rate prevailing a t the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the end of the reporting period are tran slated at the exchange rates prevailing as at the end of reporting period.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities or on 302 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY translating monetary assets and liabilities at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currency are valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of transactions.
2.20 Stripping Activity Expense/Adjustment In case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on the top of coal seam is required to be removed to get access to the coal and its extraction.
This waste removal activity is known as ‘Stripping’.In opencast mines, th e company has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine (as technically estimated).
Therefore, as a policy, in the mines with rated capacity of one million tonnes per annum and above, cost of Stripping is charge d on technically evaluated average stripping ratio (OB: COAL) at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance a ccount after the mines are brought to revenue.
Net of balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as Stripping Activity Adjustm ent under the head Non - Current Provisions / Other Non-Current Assets as the case may be.
The reported quantity of overburden as per record is considered in calculating the ratio for OBR accounting where the variance between reported quantity and measured quantity is within the lower of the two alternative permissible limits, as detailed hereunder:- Annual Quantum of OBR Permissible limits of variance Of the Mine II I % Quantum (in Mill.
Cu.
Mtr.)
Less than 1 Mill.
CUM +/- 5% 0.03 Between 1 and 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 3% 0.20 More than 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 2% However, where the variance is beyond the permissible limits as above, the measured quantity is considered.
In case of mines with rated capacity of less than one million tonne, the above policy is not applied and actual cost of strippi ng activity incurred during the year is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.21 Inventories 2.21.1  Stock of Coal Inventories of coal/coke are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of inventories are calculated using the Fir st in First out method.Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs nec essary to make the sale.
Book stock of coal is considered in the accounts where the variance between book stock and measured stock is upto +/- 5% and in  cases where the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured stock is considered.
Such stock are valued at net realisable value or cost whichever  is lower.
Coke is considered as a part of stock of coal.
Coal & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value and considered as a part of stock of coal.
Slurry (coking/semi-coking), middling of washeries and by products are valued at net realisable value and considered as a part of stock of coal.
2.21.2  Stores & Spares The Stock of stores & spare parts (which also includes loose tools) at central & area stores are considered as per balances app earing in priced stores ledger and are valued at cost calculated on the basis of weighted average method.
The inventory of stores & spare parts lying at collieries / sub-stores / drilling camps/ consuming centres are considered at the year end only as per physically verified stores and are valued at cost.
Provisions are made at the rate of 100% for unserviceable, damaged and obsolete stores and spares and at the rate of 50% for stores & spares not moved for 5 years.
2.21.3  Other Inventories Workshop jobs including work-in-progress are valued at cost.
Stock of press jobs (including work in progress) and stationary a t printing press and medicines at central hospital are valued at cost.
However, Stock of stationery (other than lying at printing press), bricks, sand, medicine (except at Central Hospitals), aircra ft spares and scraps are not considered in inventory considering their value not being significant.
2.22  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets Provisions are recognized when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it  is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the expenditure expected to settle the oblig ation.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 303 All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the  obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Possible obligations, wh ose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain events not wholly within the control of t he company, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Contingent Assets are not recognised in the financial statements.
However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain,  then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.
2.23  Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outs tanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per shares is computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity s hares considered for deriving basic earnings per shares and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon c onversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.24  Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, judgements and ass umptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Application of accountin g policies involving complex and subjective judgements and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimate are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and, if materia l, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
2.24.1  Judgements In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: 2.24.1.1 Formulation of Accounting Policies Accounting policies are formulated in a manner that result in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information  about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply.
Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.
In the absence of an Ind AS that specifically applies to a transaction, other event or condition, management has used its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is: a) relevant to the economic decision-making needs of users and b) reliable in that financial statements: (i) represent faithfully the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company; (ii) reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form; (iii) are neutral, i.e.
free from bias; (iv) are prudent; and (v) are complete in all material respects on a consistent basis In making the judgement management refers to, and considers the applicability of, the following sources in descending order: (a) the requirements in Ind ASs dealing with similar and related issues; and (b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Framework .
In making the judgement, management considers the most recent pronouncements of International Accounting Standards Board and in  absence thereof those of the other standard-setting bodies that use a similar conceptual framework to develop accounting standards, oth er accounting literature and accepted industry practices, to the extent that these do not conflict with the sources in above paragraph.
The Company operates in the mining sector (a sector where the exploration, evaluation, development production phases are based on the varied topographical and geomining terrain spread over the lease period running over decades and prone to constant changes), the accou nting policies whereof have evolved based on specific industry practices supported by research committees and approved by the various regulato rs owing to its consistent application over the last several decades.
In the absence of specific accounting literature, guidance and standa rds in certain specific areas which are in the process of evolution.
The Company continues to strive to develop accounting policies in line with the de velopment of accounting literature and any development therein shall be accounted for prospectively as per the procedure laid down above mor e particularly in Ind AS 8.
The financial statements are prepared on going concern basis using accrual basis of accounting.
304 COAL INDIA LIMITED    A MAHARATNA COMPANY 2.24.1.2 Materiality Ind AS applies to items which are material.
Management uses judgement in deciding whether individual items or groups of item ar e material in the financial statements.
Materiality is judged by reference to the size and nature of the item.
The deciding factor is whether  omission or misstatement could individually or collectively influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements.
Management also uses judgement of materiality for determining the compliance requirement of the Ind AS.
In particular circumsta nces either the nature or the amount of an item or aggregate of items could be the determining factor.
Further the Company may also be required  to present separately immaterial items when required by law.
2.24.1.3 Operating lease Companyhas entered into lease agreements.
The Company has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the commercial property and the fair value of the asset, that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.
2.24.2 Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a si gnificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described b elow.
The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond t he control of the Company.
Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
2.24.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets There is an indication of impairment if, the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount,  which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Company considers individual mines as separate cash generating u nits for the purpose of test of impairment.
The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model.
The cash flows are derived from the budget for th e next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Companyis not yet committed to or significant future investments that will  enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well as  the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
These estimates are most relevant to other mining infr astructures.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, are disclosed and further explained in respect ive notes.
2.24.2.2 Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
2.24.2.3 Defined benefit plans The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other post-employment medical benefits and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations.
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual d evelopments in the future.
These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates.
Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to  changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate.
In  determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in curre ncies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables of the country.
Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes.
Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rate.
2.24.2.4 Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using generally accepted valuation techniques including the DCF model.
The inputs to thes e models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair values.
Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk, volatility and other relevant input /considera tions.
Changes in assumptions and estimates about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
2.24.2.5 Intangible asset under development The Company capitalises intangible asset under development for a project in accordance with the accounting policy.
Initial capi talisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a project repor t is formulated and approved.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS        2017 - 2018 305 2.24.2.6  Provision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation In determining the fair value of the provision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation, assumptions a nd estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of site restoration and dismantling and the expected timing of those costs.
The Company estimates provision using the DCF method considering life of the project/mine based on ¾ Estimated cost per hectare as specified in guidelines issued by Ministry of Coal, Government of India ¾ The discount rate (pre tax rate) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to t he liability.

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classi fied its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.
An explanation of each level is given below.
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which  maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant inputs requir ed to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
This i s the case for unlisted equity securities, preference shares borrowings, security deposits and other liabilities taken included in level 3.
(c) Valuation technique used in determining fair value Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include the use of quoted market prices of instruments.
(d) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs At present there are no fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs.
(e) Fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost ¾ The carrying amounts of trade receivables, short term deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
¾ The Company considers that the Security Deposits does not include a significant financing component.
The milestone payments (se curity deposits) coincide with the company’s performance and the contract requires amounts to be retained for reasons other than the provision of finance.
The withholding of a specified percentage of each milestone payment is intended to protect the interest of the comp any, from the contractor failing to adequately complete its obligations under the contract.
Accordingly, transaction cost of Security dep osit is considered as fair value at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Significant estimates: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques.
The Company uses its judgment to select a method and makes suitable assumptions at the end of each reporting period.

(Anil Kumar Jha)                       Chairman            Page | 8     Coal for Sustainable Growth    In the last few years, the Government has taken strident steps towards increased availability of  power in tune with accelerated overall economic growth in the country.
Schemes like Saubhagya,  DDUGJY, UDAY  etc are aimed at rejuvenating powe r demand and initiatives such as AMRUT,  BHARATMALA etc have been introduced to the growth of the core industries and economic  wellbeing of people.
This growth can only be sustained through the growth of energy sector.
Coal  is the mainstay of India’s primar y energy supply and the trend of coal consumption, evidenced  from the figures of coal production as well as import of coal (2007 -2018 period) shows a rising  trend (Graph enclosed below).
At the same time, India has taken a lead in the Committee of  Nations in terms of transition towards clean energy.
Its commitment made in COP 21, founding  role in the International Solar Alliance, the thrust in introduction of Electric Vehicles are mere  examples of its proactive approach towards a cleaner tomorrow for our future generations.
Fig.
1- Coal Production & Import (Mt) :: 2007-08 to 2017-18  In a recent study done by MoC/CIL through an agency, it has been obse rved that coal demand is  likely to remain robust till 2030, while renewable energy will gradually provide greater  contribution to the energy basket of the country.
The conclusion of the study is that coal is  expected to remain the bedrock of the energy sup ply for the country till 2030.
Current demand of  coal in the nation is about 900 Mtpa and is likely to grow by over 50 % in this period in the most  likely scenario.
A significant proportion of this demand will be generated from the use of coal in  the therm al power sector.
The non -regulated sector comprising steel, cement, Captive Power  Plants etc.
would account for the remaining demand.
New segments such as power demand from  use of electric vehicles, new demand from Coal to Chemicals sector etc.
would add t o the existing  demand.
While Govt.
is working towards creating healthy domestic market for coal in the country  by encouraging the participation of private and state sectors into coal production, CIL is expected  to remain the largest supplier and may be req uired to supply upto 1300 Mt of coal by 2030.
Page | 9     Opening up of commercial mining will help the country to deal with the increased demand for  coal.
Coal Mining – Industry Outlook    Coal has been one of the key source s of primary energy for the World contributing to roughly half  of the total primary energy consumption.
However, the significance of coal varies across the  World with Asia leading the consumption, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total  primary energy consumption.
In Asia, China and India are the two key coal consumers.
Going forward, while various estimates predict fall in share of coal in the energy basket, none has  predicted a complete substitution.
In  the Indian context, this seems more unlikely unless there is  tectonic shift in nuc lear and/ or renewable generation sources and storage technologies (both in  terms of capacity and prices).
Herein lies the criticality of coal mining sector for India.
The total coal production in India in FY  2017-18 surpassed 650 Mt and is likely to inc rease to 1000 Mt by 2020-21 or thereabout.
Thermal  Power Stations are the key consumer of coal in India.
The coal demand is expected to grow even  after 2020 -21, as greater section of society are covered under grid electrification and rising  prosperity increases the per captive electricity consumption.
Indian coal mining sector is dominated by Coal India Limited and the scenario is unlikely to change  in the immediate future.
Even as government opens up the sector to private sector commercial  mining, the proportion of coal supply from CIL is likely to dominate the Indian markets.
Fig.
2- On the Occasion of ‘Meri Company Mera Gaurav’    Some of the defining features of Indian coal mining sector is dominance of opencast method for  production, smaller sized min es, medium to low mechanization and high labour intensity.
Page | 10     Government and CIL are focused on making coal mining in India safer and technically more  advanced.
Over the last year CIL has closed down 43 unviable mines.
There is also a clear trend  towards increased mechanization including introduction of larger equipment.
These elements are  important to ensure long term sustainability of Indian coal mining and minimizing the  environmental impact.
There are a number of other initiatives that the government has taken over the last few years to  minimize the environmental impact of coal mining and ensuring greater sharing of benefits across  the society including creation of District Mineral Foundation s for generating financial resources to  be invested in the mineral rich areas.

3- Clippings from Media about Revenue growth    Going forward, CIL is well placed to grow in the light of the increasing coal demand of the country.
It has targeted a growth in production of 7.5 % in  2018-19 compared to 2017-18 to reach a figure  of 610 Mt.
Evacuation facilities have historically constrained the growth of coal production and CIL  has planned to augment this capacity significantly.
CIL is on the verge of completion of three  critical rail way links in the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand in 2018 -19 which will  enable it to evacuate by rail an additional 282 Mt of coal from the linked mines.
CIL is also  exploring the scope of diversification into areas of metal mining, thermal pow er generation,  renewable energy and coal gasification.

In the long term, it can impact the coal  demand.
 Development risk remains the most important issues faced by coal mining in India and CIL,  in particular.
Land acquisition and resistance from local communities can constrain future  supplies and/ or make the cost of mining prohibitive.
 Performance of captive mining segment owned by private entities remains an issue of  concern in India.
In spite of significant  mining resources allocated to the captive mining  segment, limited number of mines has turned operational.
This can adversely impact the  coal supply in future and lead to continued dependence on imported coal.

Our process is informed by guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative’s Technical Protocol —  Applying the Report Content Principles and from Account Ability’s Five-Part Materiality Test.
Our assessment o f the material aspects was based on the inputs and various engagements CIL has  had during the year with different stakeholders.
CIL prepared an extensive list of concerns stated by  Page | 32     our stakeholders.
Based on this list CIL attempted to prioritise the most m aterial aspects of the  stake- holders.
These aspects were then assessed qualitatively by our Management Team.
Finally, CIL  has come up with a materiality matrix that is an amalgamation of both the stakeholder perspective  and management perspective.
The mat eriality matrix determined was plotted on a 2X2 matrix and  the aspects were plotted on the basis of their relevance to the management and their significant  impact on the stakeholder.

As per the Risk  Register, different risks were identified for CIL and its Subsidiaries, and Risk Owner and Risk Mitigation  Plan Owner were nominated for each risk identified to ensure continuous monitoring and mitigation  thereof.
A Risk Management Committee, a Sub -Committee of CIL Board, has started functioning from  this financial year.
A Consulting Agency has been engaged for implementing the governance process designed in the Risk  Management Framework at CIL and its Subsidiary Companies.
The Consultant will cover all asp ects  and issues regarding Risk Management and ensure achievement of the objectives of:    i) Updated Risk Registers for CIL and its Subsidiaries   ii) Risk prioritization (‘Risks That Matter’)  iii) Risk Mitigation Plan formulation for updated ‘Risks That Matter’.
The Agency has facilitated updates to Risk Registers and risk prioritization for CIL and its Subsidiary  companies.
Key Risks which are common across the Subsidiaries and those risks which are specific to  one or more Subsidiaries have also been identified.
Formul ation of mitigation plans for key risks is  under finalization.
Risks and Concerns    CIL has a comprehensive Risk Management Framework in place.
The Board of CIL had approved a Risk  Management Framework for the Company, which consists of (a) a process to id entify, prioritize and  formulate mitigation plans for prioritized risks, and, (b) a framework of roles & responsibilities of  various officers, Committees and the Board, in discharging the risk management process, periodicity  of reporting (Risk Management C alendar) and related templates and enablers.
As part of this Risk  Management Framework, risk owners and mitigation plan owners have been identified for each risk  and corresponding mitigation plans to ensure continuous risk monitoring and risk mitigation.
R isk  Management is a continuous journey to align the objectives and vision of CIL through regular risk - managed business operations.
Other Risks and Mitigation  Material aspects were identified and strategies for effective risk assessment and mitigation prog ram  were laid for longevity of our business.
The issues both relevant to management and stakeholders of  highest priority are mentioned below:    Rehabilitation and Resettlement    Coal mining location is based on geological factors and is very much site specif ic.
Opencast mining, in  general, involves acquisition of large tracts of lands.
This eventually leads to involuntary displacement  of inhabitants (Project affected People – PAPs) who are native/residents of the area in question.
Rehabilitation and resettlement plays a major role in CIL’s long term business goals by creating a bond  and cordial relations with the local society.
After enactment of The RFCTLARR Act 2013  (Popularly  known as Land Acquisition Act), providing of R&R benefits to PAPs is a statutory obligation.
Page | 34     Subsidiaries of CIL is providing liberal and attractive benefits to the project affected persons/families  which includes adequate compensation, direct employment, suitable rehab site with necessary  infrastructure facilities etc.
From 1987-88 till 31st March 2018, CIL has provided 52581 employments to land oustees against land  acquisitions across subsidiaries of CIL and 2847 no.
of land oustees have been offered employment  in  2017-18.
Supply of Quality Coal  Our consumers mainly from Power se ctor require supply of coal on time and of a good quality.
Retaining Consumer’s loyalty is an important aspect for successfully staying in business.
In this  reporting period, CIL has planned to set up 18 new washeries with state-of-the-art technologies in the  field of coal beneficiation with an aggregate throughput capacity of 95.6 MTY.
Total 109 no.
of Surface  Miners (both departmental and hired) were deployed by CIL for selective mining at the major OC  mines to improve quality of coal.
Action is being taken for deployment of more continuous miners and  surface miners in other CIL mines where geo-mining condition permits their usage.
Fig.
19- Production through Opencast Mining & Surface Miner  Health and Safety  Bearing in mind that mining has inherent risks  to health and safety and to foster a safe and healthy  work environment, CIL is continuously working for social well -being of stakeholders and in the areas  related to mining methods, strata control, and mine safety, etc.
CIL has deployed adequate numbers  of trained manpower for ensuring safety in mining operations.
A well - structured and multi - disciplinary Internal Safety Organization (ISO) has been established in each of the subsidiaries of CIL to  Page | 35     monitor the implementation of CIL’s Safety Policy.
Safety a nd Wellness at work is integral to our  operational discipline.
In tandem with technological advancement of mining operations, CIL has been ensuring and upholding  miners’ safety through close collaboration of management, employees, the regulator (DGMS) and   Trade Unions.
Regulatory Compliance   Compliances are a must for any mining organization.
CIL understands the criticality of deviating from  desired regulations in terms of long term continuity of our operations.
Hence, for good business  conduct CIL adher es to all essential regulatory norms and meets the necessary compliances.
Before  operationalizing of any new project CIL ensures that necessary clearances, (in cluding environmental  clearance and forest clearance ), have been obtained, Environment Impact Ass essments conducted,  and potential effects on all stakeholders analyzed.
Economic Performance   Out of India’s total coal production in the Financial Year 2017-18, the share of CIL is around 84%.
So,  the impact of CIL on Indian economy can be easily equate d with the impact of coal sector in Indian  economy.
India is the world’s third largest energy consumer and its energy use is projected to grow at  a rapid pace supported by economic development, urbanization, improved electricity access and an  expanding manufacturing base.
CIL and its subsidiaries have achieved an aggregate Pre -Tax Profit of Rs.
10,726.44 Crores for the year  2017-18 against a pre-tax profit of Rs.
14,446.33 Crores (restated) in the year 2016-17.
CIL as a whole  had achieved a total comprehe nsive income of Rs.
7652.73 crores in 2017 - 18 compared to Rs.
9361.77 crores in 2016- 17 (restated).
CIL received Rs.
80.79 Crores financial assistance as subsidies in  the reporting financial year.
In the light of Paris Protocol and consequent upon change s in world energy sector scenario, CIL is  looking forward to diversify its operations towards Renewable energy like Solar Power and Clean  Energy sources like CMM, CBM, CTL, UCG etc.
following the directives of GoI.
Following to that  mission, MoC/ CIL is in the process of formulating ‘Vision Document 2030’ to decide upon future  course of operation for sustainable entity in the nation’s energy sector.

Coal Marketing  Supply of coal was made to various consumers including Power Sector u nder the applicable provisions  of New Coal Distribution Policy.
Due to overall deficit in availability of coal considering the projected  coal production from domestic sources and commitments made through signing of FSAs/issuance of  Letter of Assurances (LO A), supplies under FSAs has been pegged at various level of commitments  (trigger).
Power sector being the major consuming sector having significant importance in the  economy, supplies to power sector has been guided as per the various Government directives  and  polices.
Page | 39     Off-take of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend and reached 580.2 9 million tonnes for  fiscal ended March 2018, surpassing previous highest figure of 543.32 million tonnes achieved during  the last year, i.e., an increase of 6.8 % o ver the last year.
The overall raw coal off -take achieved was  96.7% of the Annual Action Plan Target.
In the year 2017 -18, ECL, CCL, NCL, WCL, SECL and NEC could  outperform their achievement of last year.
Fig.24-Press Clippings of CIL regarding e auction    Customer Satisfaction  CIL’s motto and core driving principle is to identify and deliver the needs of consumers and adopt a  consumer centric approach to provide better service to our consumers.
For enhanced customer  satisfaction, special emphasis is give n to Quality Management of coal from mine to dispatch point.
Attuned to this objective, after independent assessment of grades of mines through various academic  institutes of national repute by the Coal Controller’s organization (CCO), the annual grade dec laration  for 2018-19 has been finalized by CCO.
A total of 386 mines were re-assessed for their coal grades and  out of these 61 mines have been downgraded and 42 mines have been up-graded.
Page | 40       Fig.25- Vendors Meet at CIL    In order to monitor coal quality, a  portal UTTAM (Unlocking Transparency by Third Party Assessment  of Mined Coal)  has been launched by CIL to capture entire life cycle of sample.
With the help of the  portal, information of coal quality on regular basis will be accessible to both Coal Cos. and Consumers.
The guidelines / SOP issued by MoC vide letter dated 26.11.2015 on third party sampling at loading  ends has already been implemented through Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR).
Sampling and analysis covering supply of ab out 529 Mt on annual basis to power utilities has been  taken up by CIMFR across various loading points of coal companies.
Electronic weighbridges with the facility of electronic printout have been installed at rail loading  points to ensure that coal disp atches are made only after proper weighment.
Coal Companies have  also taken action for installation of standby weighbridges to ensure 100% weighment.
22 Auto Mechanical Samplers (AMS) are also working in subsidiary coal companies for coal sampling,  eliminating chances of biasness in sampling process.
Procurement of further AMS is under process.
The process has been initiated to do a pilot study for deployment of   Augur Sampling equipment to  draw samples without human intervention.
In order to ensure consumer satisfaction and resolve consumer complaints, special emphasis has been  given to quality management and redressal of consumer complaint.
On -line filing and redressal of  complaints have been implemented.
A total of 3 pending grievances were carried f orward from 2016- Page | 41     17 for redressal.
Fresh online grievances received in 2017-18 were 30.
In total, 30 cases were resolved  in CIL during 2017-18 and remaining 3 cases were forwarded to the succeeding year for redressal.
Managing Supply Chain  CIL plans and ex ecutes as a socially responsible company.
CIL promotes local suppliers which plays an  important role in developing local economy.
CIL ensure that suppliers and contractors are screened as  per statutory labour practices.
Fig.26-Buyer-Seller Meet in CIL  Initiation of E- tendering Procurement Mechanism    As CIL engage s with world class suppliers, CIL  tries to come up with strategies which help in making  the system hassle free and strengthen our supply chain.
For the same, CIL has initiated an e –tender  procurement proceeding being done after confirmation of eligibility criteria and TPS from the  Technical Department.
This mechanism allows supply is being made directly to the subsidiary  companies as per their requirement from time to time.
Vendor selection is  done when the party  meets the eligibility criteria and accepts the commercial terms & conditions of the NIT.
CIL is also undertaking various vendor engagement initiatives where vendors are invited for their  active participation which includes the buyer s eller meet which is organized by the Vigilance Division  from time to time for awareness of the Procurement System adopted towards procurement of goods  at CIL level.
CIL organize s pre-bid meetings with the vendors from time to time for awareness of the  system as the vendors of equipments in demand such as HEMM, Explosives and OTR Tyres are limited.
In addition, regular training of the new system of procurement to the vendors is also being provided  by us.
Page | 42       Environmental Performance  Commitment on Environmental Sustainability  CIL’s objective is to achieve its coal production target in a sustainable manner, finally ending with mine  closure  leaving the land suitable for u tilization by future generation.
CIL’s mining activities and  operational decisions constantly take account of environmental concerns.
At present, 267 no.
dedicated  environmental engineers are looking after the environmental aspects of CIL’s operations.
The Environment  Policy of CIL has been approved by CIL Board in the year 2012 and currently under process of review for  updating.
CIL has spent Rs.
122.86 Crore towards “Environmental and Tree Plantation Expenses” in 2017-18 in  comparison to Rs.
116.28 Crores in 2016-17.
CIL’s approach    Every mine requires a detailed environment impact assessment to  be carried out considering pre and  post mining operations for preparing EMPs which are discussed in detail by the Environmental  Appraisal Committee (EAC) of experts under MoEF&CC.
On the basis of the discussions, EAC  recommends or rejects the case and acc ordingly Environment Clearance (EC) is granted by the  MoEF&CC to us.
While granting EC, MoEF& CC lays down certain conditions/ mitigation measures for implementing the  EMPs which are followed by CIL in letter & spirit.
CIL monitors the compliance of the conditions laid in the EC conditions and reports the same regularly  to MOEF&CC and SPCB.
Fig.
27-Van Mahotsava 2018 - A festival of Life celebration  Page | 43     Various measures being taken are as follows:    a.
Land reclamation and its monitoring by Remote Sensing Survey   With a view to  minimize  the  impacts  of  mining  on  land  and  make  it  available  for  alternative   use  in  future, a  comprehensive  plan  to  rehabilitate  all  land  disturbed  by  mining  operations  has   been  built  in  the  project plan ning stage itself.
The external over burden dumps created during the  initial opening of the mine cuts are also being converted into vegetative one thereby controlling soil  and air pollution.
With the above in mind, reclamation and afforestation activities  are carried out continually to reclaim  the dump and backfilled areas both physically and biologically to control soil erosion and also to give a  green cover to the barren dump yard and backfilled areas to bring back the fauna and flora.
The land is  reclaimed for agricultural, horticulture crops and development of forestry, pasture land etc.
CIL has engaged Indian Council of Forest Research and Education (ICFRE) to carry out an  environmental audit of 20 Open Cast mines of various subsidiaries of Coal Ind ia Ltd in 1st phase to  evaluate the status of E.C conditions.
ICFRE has submitted the draft report which is under examination  by CIL and its Subsidiaries.
Further CIL has awarded a job to ICFRE in 2017 -18 for developing, approach and methodology for  index rating of environmental conditions etc of selected 35 mines which produces more than 5 Mm 3  (Coal+OB) per annum.
b.
Tree plantation:   Extensive tree plantation programme is undertaken every year by the CIL and its Subsidiaries.
Avenue  plantation, plantation on the OB dumps, plantation around mines, residential colonies, and available  land is undertaken in existing as well as new projects.
Since inception, CIL has planted around 96  million trees in an area of 38,378 Ha.
till March 2018.

Massive Plantation in CIL Mine    c. Air Pollution control measures:   CIL is taking effective dust suppression measures in all mines through mobile and fixed sprinklers on  haul roads and other dust generatio n areas.
The other emphasis areas are black topping of roads,  compulsory covering of coal transport trucks, avenue plantation and dense afforestation on all vacant  areas.
As a trial, in one project tube conveyor has been installed substituting road trans port.
A collaborative  R & D project on haul road dust dispersion and its control has been initiated for a mine of CCL.
CIL monitors the ambient air quality in and around the mine site on a fortnightly basis with a  Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring  Station.
CAAQMS are installed in four locations of SECL,  one location in MCL and one location in WCL.
CAAQMSs are being installed at three locations in BCCL,  one in WCL and one in NCL.
CIL has agreed to install 16 CAAQMS in different cities of the country as  decided by CPCB.
During the year, the emissions from different monitoring stations have been  recorded and are elucidated in the table on the right.

There are  total 32 ETPs, 27 DETPs and 50 Workshop ETPs functional in CIL.
Fig.
33 -Mine water drainage system at CIL  Most of the mines are adopting rain water harvesting and wherever needed, are recharging ground  water through boreholes or recharge wells.
In a few mines, installation of piezometers indicates  that  the ground water level has increased due to mine water recharge.
There is total 118 rain water  harvesting projects in CIL out of which 8 projects were created in 2017-18.
Fig.
34-Efluent Treatment Plant    Only from a few mines the problem of acid mine drainage has been reported.
Where such report  comes, CIL takes measures for neutralizing the acidic component (as per CPCB Gui delines) before  allowing the mine discharge to get outside the mine leasehold.
Page | 48       Fig.
35-Mine Water to Drinking Water-Coal Neer  The objective of CIL is for maximum utilization of Mine Water for community use.
Average mine water  discharged from CIL mines is around 5443.46 Lakh m 3/year.
Accordingly, steps have been taken for  making water available round the year to the community for irrigation and other domestic uses.
Through all its projects, CIL has reached a total number of 8.9 Lakh beneficiaries.

6289.31 Crores has been deposited in  427 no.
of Escrow Accounts and Rs.
183.09 Crores have been released from Escrow fund against  execution of Mine Closure activities.
Page | 50         g. Efforts to conserve bio-diversity.
Tree Plantation on reclaimed back filled areas & external Over Burden (OB) dump areas, plantation in  and around mines, road sides, township / residential areas, available vacant spaces and  implementation of conservation plan for protection of flora & fauna are carried out as per EC /FC.
This is apart from the payment made for compensatory afforestation to Forest departments against  equal non-forest land or double the degraded forest land as identified by State Govt.
Such massive  plantation activities have created many manmade forests in mining areas where there were no forests  earlier.
Since beginning, the coal and lignite companies have under taken the plantation work.
The plantation  work has been carried mainly through concerned State Forest Corporations.
Keeping native bio - diversity in mind, we plant indigenous plants to preserve the native eco-system.
The main objective of land-use and reclamation in mined out areas is to identify the land for successful  ecosystem development and to minimize the impact to the local environment after a mine is closed.
The reclaimed land must meet the key goal of sustainability, which is the protection and continuation  of the land use alternatives for future generations.
CIL has considered proper reclamation (both  technical and biological) and min ing site closure.
Satellite Surveillance for land reclamation was given  the requisite thrust by partnering with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad.
Satellite  Surveillance has been introduced for all the open cast mines in order to monitor the la nd reclamation  activities of the mining sites.
This has been done in order to comply with the MoEFCC stipulations as  well as for progressive mine closure monitoring.
Land Restoration / Reclamation monitoring of 50 Opencast Coal Mines Projects of CIL produ cing more  than 5 million cum (Coal+OB) based on Satellite Data for the Year 2017-18.
The steps for the land reclamation includes: -       Fig.38- Steps taken for land reclamation at CIL      Page | 51       Fig.
39.
Large Scale Plantation    Scientific studies, principles and approaches have been conducted in order to select suitable species of  plants for each coalfield with a sustainable sequence of reclamation from grass to shrubs, and trees.
The aim is to develop sustainable and ecologically healthy land.
Top soil has been recognized as an  invaluable natural resource.
Management of top soil is important as to increase the soil nutrient and  microbes.
This has been done especially for regeneration of the regional ecology with measures  ranging from effective Bio -reclamation of disturbed land.
For this, the Forest Research Institute has  been engaged by CIL to gain a partner whose rich expertise in the field of eco -restoration can help in  the reclaimed areas.
Re-vegetation constitutes accepted and useful way to reduce erosion and protect  soils against degradation during reclamation.
Therefore, the whole land reclamation process restores  the ecological integrity that makes degraded land soils productive.
Page | 52                        Fig.
40- Eco-parks & Water Body  Vegetation is the most appro priate method for land restoration and it is achieved through a  systematic process.
Re-vegetation of mined -out areas depends on the chemical and physical traits of  the land.
To haul out the better result, CIL is making efforts in order to understand the ec ological  variables which have to be considered while selecting suitable species for plantation.
These are; their  capacity to stabilize soil, increase soil organic matter and nutrients, and facilitate the under -storey  development.
CIL has always fostered a nd cultivated a culture to achieve greener footprint and nurtured  afforestation in various mines.
Eco Parks have been developed in many of the mined out areas.
Some  of the examples are enlisted below.
 Gunjan Park of ECL   Ananya Vatika of SECL   Nigahi of NCL   Saoner of WCL   Kayakalp Vatika in CCL   Rajarappa Eco Park in CCL      Fig.

43- Major impacts due to mining at CIL  Page | 54           Fig.44- The strategy enacted to mitigate environmental burden due to mining activities by CIL    Energy Supply and Conservation    Almost 70% of electricity generation in India is through thermal power plants.
Coal is a dominant  commercial fuel to meet the demand.
A small amount of energy comes from Green Energy or Nuclear  Energy, leading to high level of dependency on coal as a fuel to produce energy for industrial and  social requirements.
CIL is striving to meet the energy requirement of the country with minimum adverse impact  to the  environment.
The focus has been given to improvement of the energy efficiency.
Coal Mining  operations are very energy -intensive processes  and involve  the use of high amount of fuel and  electricity.
The extraction of coal, transportation and other processes require energy.
While the fuel  consumption is due to the usage in our HEMMs, an insignificant quantity of the same is also used for  the DG sets.
There are considerable efforts made to improve the consistency of metering data for  energy consumption.
CIL and its subsidiaries have automated measuring systems  for dispensing of  fuel.
As an environmentally aligned organization, CIL is aware of c limate change as on e of the most  critical challenges.
CIL has a great responsibility to provide affordable energy with minimum carbon  footprint by implementing modern technology.
Reducing energy consumption in CIL mines helps in  reducing green house gas emissions.
Page | 55     Specific Energy Consumption (kWh/te)    Conservation of energy has always been a priority area and CIL/Subsidiaries have extensively exercised  various measures towards reduction in specific energy consumption.
Coal production during 2017 -18 was 567.37 Million Tonnes vis -à-vis 554.14 Million tonnes in 2016 -17  with a growth of 2.39% from previous year.
Electricity consumption during the same period i.e 2017 - 18 was 4605.70 Million Units with a reduction of 5.8% compare to previous year (4888.78 Millio n  Units).
Overall average Specific Energy Consumption at CIL during 2017 -18 was 8.12 kWh/te vis -à-vis  8.82 kWh/te during 2016 -17 with a reduction of 7.9 % from previous year.
All the subsidiaries of CIL  endeavour to maintain this trend of reduction in spec ific energy consumption (kWh/te) as depicted in  the Figure below:        Fig.45- Specific Energy Consumption (kWh/te)  Solar Energy     CIL and its Subsidiary Companies are also pursuing use of alternative energy sources.
CIL has  submitted Green Energy Commitmen t letter to MNRE for developing 1000 MW Solar Power Projects.
For implementation of these projects, CIL has signed MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of India  (SECI).
In the 1st phase, tender was floated for setting up of 2x100 MW Solar PV projects in the s tate  of Madhya Pradesh.

CIL carries out regular study in accordance with the application of latest  technology in order to create sustainable growth for the surroundings.
Once the coal has been  extracted, various kinds of wastes such as solid was te, mine water , process waste, suspended air  particulate matter, instrumental waste, burnt oil and oil spills, tailings, sludge etc are left behind and  have to be neutralized or dumped in secure enclosures for minimal impact on environment.
Hazardous materials, used oil and explosives are managed appropriately and the same is reflected in  our Environmental Audit Statement that is submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board and State  Pollution Control Board in Form -V. No coal spillage and oil spillage were reported during the reporting  year.
