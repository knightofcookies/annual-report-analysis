The Directors’ Report and the Financial Statement  for the year ended 31st March, 2017 together with the report of Statutory Auditors and report and review of Comptroller & Auditor General  of India are already with you.
1.
Impor tance of coal and Coal India Limited  There  is a perceptible shift in the country in fortifying the energy options currently.
Renewable energy sources like Solar and Wind  are being explored, encouraged and added as energy upgrades to meet the growing energy demand in the country.
As clean energy  options they are welcome.
The addition from these sources, to the energy mix, can be viewed as complementary but not competitive  to coal’s role.
They certainly can supplement but cannot substitute coal as preferred energy fuel, at least for now.
Coal  has gotten immensely cleaner over the past generation.
New and better ways are being found to extract energy from coal without  sending its by products into the environment.
HELE, that is, High Efficiency Low Emission technology is one such step in bringing  down the emissions.
In  India, what makes coal such a preferred energy fuel is its abundance, availability and affordability.
The estimated geological re- source of coal in India stood 315.149 Billion Tonnes as of 1 April, 2017.
Around 73% of the entire power generated in the country is  coal based.
Reliab le energy is a correlate of economic growth and human development.
Coal, being reliable, continues to serve the country as its  primary commercial energy provider and will remain a mainstay in Indian power generation for decades to come.
In fact, reliance on  coal might increase in future.
Against  this back backdrop, you will be proud to know that your company, Coal India Limited, spearheads the country’s coal produc- tion and produces 84% of the country’s entire coal output.
It is Coal India which virtually fuels and empowers the power sector in the  country.
2.
Accomplishments 2016-17  Sustaining  the growth arc in production and off-take, the company had exceeded half-a-Billion Tonne mark in both the physical facets  for the second consecutive year.
Dur ing 2016-17 Coal India achieved coal production of 554.14 Million Tonnes (Mt).
Y ou will be pleased to know that company has in- creased its production by 15.39 million tonnes over last year.
Coal production has taken a quantum jump of over 100 MTs in a five-year  span, from the level of 452.21 Mt.
recorded in 2012-13 to the current level.
This scale of increase has never been achieved previously  during a 5-year period.
The perf ormance of NCL, CCL and BCCL merit specific mention as the three companies have achieved their respective AAP targets  in coal production amid trying circumstances.
SECL continues to be at the helm of coal production with 140 Mt.
mark during the year,  with MCL giving a close competitive run up with 139.21 Mt.
Ra w coal off-take during FY 2017 was 543.32 MT, an increase of 8.82 MTs on a year-on-year comparison.
NCL has achieved AAP  target in off-take also despite heavy monsoon.
ECL, CCL, NCL, MCL and NEC achie ved higher off-take than previous year.
Coal  despatch to power utilities (including special forward e-Auction) during the year was 425.397 Mt.
registering a growth of 3%  compared to last year (413.11 Mt.).
Despatch to NTPC clocked a growth of 4.9% over last year registering a materialization of 95%  against FSA/MoU commitment.
But for the regulated intake of coal by many of the GenCos, despatch of coal to power sector could  have been higher.
Other positives: 1)  Y ou will be pleased to know that your company’s Gross Sales turnover was ` 1,22,294.46 crores during the financial year 2016-17.
2)  The  underground production got major boost with the introduction of Longwall technology in Jhanjra Combined UG Mine (3.5 Mty.)
of  ECL in August’2016.
3)  Coal  India has been accredited with IS/ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management System) and IS/ ISO 50001:2011 (Energy Management  System) certification on 27th October’2016.
It is now in the process of implementation of ISO 14001: 2015 (Environment Management  System).
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 9 2016 - 2017 Financial Performance: Coal India is one the highest contributors to the government ex-chequer both – Central and State governments.

Strategies f or Growth  Coal  India is faced with meeting challenging targets in the years ahead.
Going forward, in order to meet the production targets, Coal  India needs to step up to a double digit growth rate.
T o sustain the growth momentum in its production and off-take in future, Coal India has formulated following multi-pronged strategies.
(i)  Critical Rail way Links - Collaboration with State Governments & Railways.
In  a move of ‘Synergy for Energy’ to achieve the planned growth in production and evacuation in future, your company has un- dertaken three major Railway Infrastructure Projects, implemented either by Railways or JV Companies formed between IRCON,  Subsidiary Company and concerned Statement Government.
The three major Railw ay Infrastructure Projects are :-    (a)  T ori – Shivpur-Kathotia New BG Line.
This railway line caters to North Karanpura Area of CCL and it is Planned to evacuate  about 32 MTY of coal once the line comes through.
(b)  Jharsuguda  – Barpali – Sardega Rail Link relates to the coalfields of MCL and the envisaged capacity evacuation is 70 MT/Y  of coal from MCL.
(c)  East  Rail Corridor and East West rail corridor is planned for evacuation of coal of Mand- Raigarh and Korba – Gevra Coal- fields of SECL respectively.
In all, about 180 MTY of coal shall be evacuated through these two corridors.
(ii)  Acquisition and P ossession of land    Dur ing 2016-17, total of 3826.19 Hectares of land has been taken into possession in various subsidiaries of Coal India.

5.
Saf ety – Always a priority  Saf ety of miners and mines remains a top priority concern for Coal India.
In pursuit of higher production, no compromise would be  made on safety front.
Safety of miners and mines override any other priority.
Coal India has a well-defined safety policy to ensure  safety in all mines and establishments.
There are many preventive measures being pursued against accidents.
Safety personnel are  exposed to the best practices internationally and are sent for training abroad enabling them to hone up their skills and to sensitize  them to approach safety issue in a scientific and holistic manner.
We are also inculcating and monitoring a safety culture and attitude.
The endeavor is to elevate safety standards radically further, since in this regard there could be only ‘Zero Accident’ as the goal.

CO AL MARKETING 3.1  (a)  Off-take of Ra w Coal    Off-tak e of raw coal continued to maintain its upward trend  and reached 543.32 million tonnes for fiscal ended March  2017, surpassing previous highest figure of 534.50 million  tonnes achieved during the last year, i.e., an increase of 1.7  % over the last year.
The overall raw coal off-take achieved  was 90.8 % of the Annual Action Plan Target.
In the year  2016-17, ECL, CCL, NCL, MCL and NEC outperformed  their achievement during the last year.
NCL had exceeded  its target for 2016-17.
Company-wise target vis-à-vis actual off-take for 2016-17 and  2015-16 are shown under Annexure 6.
Offtake could have been more, but for the following  reasons:    P ower houses started the year with huge stock of 38.7  Mt and regulated intake and preferred to consume from  stock.
Almost 12 Mt stock consumed from the stock by  the power stations during the year.
Wagon availability also  sporadically affected off-take at different subsidiaries.
ECL:  Production and dispatch of coal from Rajmahal OCP  was adversely affected due to fatal accident.
Less demand  of higher grade coal from the Power Houses.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 40 A Maharatna Company   CCL:  Intermittent Law & Order problem.
Logistics bottleneck  at Amrapali-Magadh Mines had also come in the way of  augmenting off-take.
WCL:  TPPs were particularly reluctant to take coal from  Cost Plus Sources.
SECL:Less demand of higher g rades of Korea Rewa coal.
MCL:  Sporadic incidence of law and order problem &  less supply of wagons against their indents affected MCL  despatch.
Less movement through MGR mode also affected  overall dispatch.
Initiatives taken for enhancing off-take:  •  Regular  co-ordination with Railway Board to optimize  use of logistics resources available in the subsidiary coal  companies, analyzing inputs of the subsidiaries to identify  alternate source for coal movement wherever and whenever  required to achieve overall sectoral targets and mitigating  critical fuel requirement of consuming sectors, particularly  power stations.
•  Coordination  with MOC for various long and short-term  policy decisions to overcome coal movement constraints  for power and non-power sector consumers and taking  operational decisions for moving coal from various sources  on contingent situations to meet critical requirements of  consuming sectors, particularly power utilities etc.
•  P eriodic Meetings and follow up with Power producers in  addressing issues relating to coal movement.
•  Source  Rationalization of coal linkage for optimizing coal  movement as per the requirement of the consumers and  logistics.
•  Logistics  is one of the major hurdles in reaching coal to  the consumers.
Capacity constraints both in terms of track  and rolling stock are coming in the way for achieving the  requisite growth.
In order to boost-up the rail transport  system, following initiatives have been taken:    o  SPVs  by the coal companies with the State  Governments and Railways for creating rail  infrastructure - two SPVs have already been formed  at Chhattisgarh for creating rail connectivity at Korba/ Raigarh.
Similarly, SPVs were also incorporated at  Jharkhand and Odisha for similar initiatives.
o  Three  major last mile rail connectivity projects at  Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have been  brought under PMO Monitoring Mechanism to ensure  commissioning as per the schedule.
o  Special  attention is given for improving coal  distribution network for small and medium and other  sector consumers.
CIL organized meeting with State  Governments to streamline the process of nominating  distribution agencies by them.
o  Coal companies started supplying 100 mm crushed  coal to its consumers w.e.f January’2016.
•  Special E-A uction Schemes    F rom the year 2015-16, Special Forward E-Auction scheme  was introduced by MOC for meeting the coal requirement  of Power plants is being continued.
During 2015-16 & 2016- 17, around 13.8 Mill tons & 47 Mill tons coal was booked by  consumers under this scheme of e-auction respectively.
A  similar scheme for consumers in the non – power sector  was also launched as Exclusive E-auction scheme for  non-power .
During 2015-16 & 2016-17 , around 1.5 Mill  tons & around 6.2 Mill tons coal was booked by non power  consumers under this e-auction respectively .
Special  Spot e-auction was also conducted once in 2016- 17 with the objective for liquidating coal stock especially  from the high stock mines and to provide scope for  procuring coal at a competitive price by the consumers  of non-specified end use.
Around 6.2 Mill tons coal was  booked in this e-auction.
•  W eb Portal for MSME Sector-    The  web portal “Coal Allocation Monitoring System”  was launched on 17th March’2016 by Minister of State  with independent charge for Power, Coal and New &  Renewable Energy along with the officials from Ministry  of Coal and Coal India Limited at New Delhi.
The portal  aims to ease the conduct of business for small and medium  sector consumers having annual requirement of less than  10,000 tonnes of coal.
The portal will make the system  of distribution of coal to such consumers through State  Nominated Agencies, more transparent.
It has the following  advantages:    a.
Ease of doing b usiness for consumers    b .
Accountability  on the part of the Govt.
and its  enterprises    c.  24  x 7 access of information on supply and distribution  of coal in public domain    d. Online  registration and feedback system for consumers  for improving the system    e .
T ransparent coal distribution    f .
State and consumer a wareness    g. P eer audit among stakeholders (b)  Sector -wise dispatch of coal & coal products:  In  the year 2016-17, CIL dispatched 542.494 MT of Coal &  Coal Products against the AAP target of 598.031 MT i.e., an  achievement of 90.7%.
CIL has dispatched 7.9 MT of coal and  coal products more than last year with a growth of 1.5%.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 41 2016 - 2017  425.397 MT of coal and coal products, including despatches  under special forward e-auction to power was despatched to  the power utilities against the target of 450.990 MT i.e., an  achievement of 94.3%.
This is 12.3 MT more than last year’s  dispatch of 413.109 MT, which also includes despatches under  special forward e-auction to power, resulting in a growth of 3%.
Sector-wise  break-up of dispatch of coal & coal products for  2016-17 against the target and last year’s actual is disclosed in  Annexure 7.
3.2  Dispatc hes of coal and coal products by various modes:  Dispatches  of coal and coal products during 2016-17 went upto  542.494 million tonnes from 534.624 million tonnes registering  a growth of 1.5%.
Overall dispatch by Non-Rail mode had been  91.9% of the target.
Growth in despatches via Rail mode was  3.9 % whereas in the overall Non-Rail mode it decreased by  1.4 %.
Road despatches decreased by 0.6% compared to the  previous year.
Movement by MGR also decreased by 3.5%  compared to last year.
Despatches through other modes, like  belt & rope increased by 5.7 % compared to the last year.
Dispatch of coal and coal products by various modes for the years  2016-17 and 2015-16 is disclosed in Annexure 8.
3.3  W agon Loading  Ov erall wagon loading materialization was 90.9 % of the  target.
This was achieved due to sustained efforts and regular  coordination with railways at different levels.
The increase in  loading over last year was of 9.1 rakes per day.
Company wise  performance showed that NCL exceeded its target.
All the  subsidiaries except BCCL exceeded last year’s level of loading.
W agon loading could have been even better but for the regulated  lifting by Power Utilities almost in all the subsidiaries; less  demand for higher grade coal from ECL and SECL, intermittent  law and order problem in CCL and MCL also affected rail  dispatch.
W agon loading performance of 2016-17 vis-à-vis 2015-16 is  disclosed in Annexure 9.
3.4  Consumer Satisfaction  i .
For enhanced customer satisfaction, special emphasis given  to Quality Management.
Attuned to this objective, it was  decided that 2017-18 will be declared as ‘Quality Y ear’.
ii.
In order to monitor quality right at the coalface, Officer in  charge of mining have been given target to contain grade  slippages within 10%.
iii.
Another big step to ensure proper quality w as independent  assessment of grades of 871 mines/ loading points/  fractions through various academic institutes of national  repute by CCO.
Based on the analysis reports received  from these institutions, CCO finalized the grades of  different mines/sidings for the year 2017-18.
Although the  results of re-gradation of about 49% mines/ loading points/  fractions were not encouraging, correction would enhance  the confidence of consumers.
iv .
In  order to monitor coal quality internally, a portal has been  designed by CIL to capture entire life cycle of sample.
With  the help of portal, analysis of coal quality on regular basis  will be possible.
v .
CIL  has enhanced coal handling plant capacity of about  320 MT per annum so as to maximize dispatches of  crushed/ sized coal to Power sector.
CIL is supplying (-)  100mm sized coal to all power plants w. e. f. 01.01.2016  except those at pit head.
In addition, mobile crushers have  been installed to meet the additional crushing requirement.
vi.
Emphasis  has been given for maximum production through  surface miners.
For this, surface miners have been deployed  for production of coal in mines wherever technically /  commercially feasible.
About 50% of CIL ’s production is  being mined through surface miners.
Deployment of this  technology at OCP mines is bound to improve coal quality.
At present 75 Surface Miners are working in opencast  mines.
vii.
In  addition, the Washeries at BCCL, CCL, WCL and NCL  have crushing/ sizing facilities to the tune of about 36.8  million tonnes.
22 new coal washeries and renovation of 05  existing washeries combined capacity of 123.7 MTPA are  in various stages of planning/ commissioning.

17environmental clearances were also obtained from  MoEF for different Projects/Group of Mines, Washeries and  Sand mining projects of CIL during the year 2016-17.
15.2Pollution Control Measures and Their Efficacy  Coal  India has been keeping utmost importance in protecting  environment by practicing and following sustainable mining  so as to ensure that the mining operations has least impact  on environment.
The various Pollution control measures and  initiatives are taken up concurrently with mining operations  for maintaining acceptable/permissible limits of major  physical and chemical attributes of environment namely air,  water, hydrogeology, ground vibrations, noise, land & nearby  population.
(A)  Air P ollution Control Measures:  T o control and reduce dust generation during drilling,  blasting, loading and Coal transportation, Coal India Ltd.  has taken up various initiatives based on the Environmental  Management Plans (EMP) which were already prepared  before commencement /enhancement of production of coal  mines.
This EMP is prepared keeping in mind the impact on  existing environment and forest due to coal mining projects  through Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study of each  project.
Suitab le water spraying systems for arresting fugitive dust in  roads, washeries, CHPs, Feeder Breakers, Crushers, coal  transfer points and coal stock areas are being installed.
Mist  spray systems have been introduced along conveyor routes,  transfer points and on bunkers.
Mobile water sprinkling has  been provided in all the haul roads of OC mines.
In addition to  these, the projects are enhancing the water sprinkling through  engagement of contractual water tankers.
Automatic sprinklers  have also been installed in CHPs.
Some of the important  initiatives are also mentioned below:  a)  Mobile  sprinklers have been installed along haul roads to  control dust generated by truck and dumpers movements.
b)  Optim um level of loading of coal in trucks and railway  wagons to avoid spillage on roads and rail.
c)  Co vering of coal trucks by tarpaulin is being followed to  avoid spillage of coal particles during transport.
d)  Blac ktopping, repairing and strengthening of haul roads  are regularly and scientifically carried out.
e)  Plantation  in surroundings of active mining areas and along  the hauls roads are carried out to create green buffers/ green belts in and around the mines.
f)  In  order to reduce the dust pollution due to road  transportation eco-friendly mode of transport are being  introduced.
Transportation to thermal power stations, who  consume more than 80% of thermal coal are carried out by  rail / series of belt conveyors.
Rail heads are constructed  and made available nearer to mine so as to reduce road  transportation.
CIL have constructed / are constructing  integrated CHP for rapid loading of wagons and trucks.
g)  T ube conveyors mode of transportation is also being  introduced in some mines for transportation of coal to  thermal power plants.
The wall/sides of CHPs are also  covered by side cladding with GI Sheet to control pollution  at source.
h)  T o contain dust emission at source itself, dust extractors /  wet drilling systems are being undertaken.
i)  Controlled  blasting and habitation away from the mines  have been introduced as far as possible.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 57 2016 - 2017  j)  Moder n technologies like Surface Miners and Continuous  Miner at different subsidiaries of CIL which generates lesser  air borne pollution as compared to conventional mining  have been introduced to the system.
During the year 2016- 17, CIL has produced about 48.89% (i.e.
255.027 MT) of its  production from open cast mines through Surface miners.
Continuous miners contributed about 4.689 MT in the  production from underground mines.
k)  The  quality of Ambient air in and around the mine site is  being monitored fortnightly.
The required and stipulated  numbers of ambient air quality monitoring stations are  maintained, as per environmental rules and regulations  of Environment (Protection) Act, 2006, and its reports are  regularly submitted to SPCBs and MoEF&CC.
l)  The  concept of ‘Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring  Stations’ (CAAQMS) are being introduced and are installed  / being installed in large mines of CIL.
Continuous Ambient  Air Quality Monitoring Stations have been installed at 4  locations in SECL and 01 location of WCL.
(B)  Mine W ater Management:  W ater which pumped out from the underground and open cast  mines are being contaminated with suspended particles.
Some  small quantity of water being contaminated during washing  and cleaning of HEMM.
CIL also takes initiative by treating this  water.
The treated water is being supplied to the local villages  after mine consumption.
Quality of the final effluent is monitored  in terms of the relevant Indian standards.
l Domestic Effluent Treatment Plant (DETP): The domestic  effluent from major residential colonies is treated in DETP  either by activated sludge method or by extended aerated  lagoons.
l Mine Discharge Treatment Plants (MDTP) are installed in  mines for treatment of mine water.
Strata seepage water in  mines first gets accumulated in the mine sump which provides  for initial settlement of suspended particles.
The supernatant  water from the sump is then pumped out on surface and  treated in surface sedimentation tank, which provides for  second stage settlement.
The treated mine water is then  used partly within the mine premises for dust suppression,  fire fighting, plantation, washing and further treated as per  drinking water standard for supply to company township and  nearby villages through pressure filter / RO, etc.
After ensuring  maximum re-use within and around mine premises the excess  treated mine pumped out water is released onto local nalla  / streams which is used by the surrounding local population  specially for agricultural use.
l In order to assess the impact of mining activities on ground  water, quarterly monitoring of ground water levels is being  carried out in and around the coal mines covering the buffer  zone (i.e.10 Kms radius).
Further, recharging of ground  water is also taken up within mine premises as well as  in nearby villages through rainwater harvesting, digging  of ponds/development of lagoons, de-silting of existing  ponds/tanks etc.
l Regular monitoring of mine effluent, workshop effluent,  and domestic effluent is carried out every fortnight as per  Environment (Protection) Rule – 2006.
Reports of the same  are regularly submitted to SPCBs and MOEF .
(C)  Noise P ollution Control Measure:  F or control of noise pollution, following measures are adopted:  i)  Proper maintenance of equipment to minimiz e vibration  ii)  Green  belt provided around the mine as well as residential  area.
iii)  Controlled Blasting & b lasting in only day time.
iv)  Use  of Surface Miner, Continuous Miner & High Wall mining  which extract coal without blasting.
v)  Ear  Muff or Ear Plugs provided to Workers at highly noisy  areas (D)  Land Rec lamation:  Reclamation  of the mined out areas and the external OB dumps  is a major environmental mitigatory activity taken up by Coal  India.
In all new mines reclamation of mined out areas are being  done as per the Environmental Management Plan and Mine  closer plan which are approved by MoEF&CC.
Back filling of  the OB material in the mine voids is part of the mining operation  cycle.
Topsoil preservation, storing and use in the plantation  areas of the reclaimed areas are being done in the opencast  mines wherever necessary.
Concurrent reclamation and  rehabilitation of mined out areas (subject to technical feasibility  as per geo-mining conditions) are taken for gainful land use.
Opencast mines are filled up with overburden extracted during  the process of extraction of coal and after technical reclamation  is completed plantation is carried out which is termed as  biological reclamation.
l Eco-restoration: For effective Bio- reclamation of disturbed  land, scientific studies are carried out to select suitable  species of plants for each coalfield and sustainable sequence  of reclamation from grass to shrubs, to trees.
Forest Research  Institute (FRI) have been engaged by CIL for sharing their  expertise in the field of eco-restoration in the reclaimed areas.
ECO restoration sites are developed in Damoda, Tetulmari of  BCCL, with technical guidance of FRI.  l Eco-park in Rec laimed land: Eco Parks have been  developed in many of the mined out areas of CIL like  Gunjan Park of ECL, Ananya Vatika of SECL, Nigahi of  NCL, Saoner of WCL, Kayakalp Vatika, Rajarappa Eco  Park in CCL etc.
l T ree plantation: Green belt is developed through extensive  tree plantation programme every year by the subsidiaries  of Coal India Ltd. Avenue plantation, plantation on the OB  dumps, plantation around mines, residential colonies, and  available land is undertaken in existing as well as new  projects.
The subsidiaries of CIL have planted around  94.015 million of trees covering an area over 37557.458  Ha.
till March 2017.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 58 A Maharatna Company  l Monitoring of Reclamation: CIL introduced state-of-the- art Satellite Surveillance to monitor land reclamation and  restoration for all opencast projects.
The land reclamation  and rehabilitation operations are being monitored by  Satellite Surveillance.
50 major OCPs excavating more  than 5 Mm (Coal+OB) per annum are being monitored  every year while remaining OCPs excavating less than  5 Mm (Coal+OB) per annum are being monitored every  3rd year.
This gives a clear picture of reclamation, which  otherwise is difficult to accurately estimate.
The study  during 2016-17 shows that all the major OCPs (excavating  > 5 Mm (Coal+OB) per annum) have reclaimed area of  77.59% and active mining area is only 22.41% of the total  excavated area.
In addition, CIL is conducting vegetation  cover mapping through satellite surveillance in every 3  years.
l Mine Closer Plan (MCP):  Mine closure plan is an  integral part of the project report prepared by CMPDIL  for coalmines.
This progressive mine closure plan also  forms a part of the EIA/EMP prepared and submitted to  MOEF for Environmental Clearance.
The progressive  reclamation of mined out areas inbuilt in the project cost  is implemented accordingly.
After exhaustion of reserves,  statutory obligations in respect of closure are also followed.
CIL is practicing mine closure very effectively.
CIL is  committed for restoration of abandoned / mined out areas  in a socially acceptable & environment friendly manner.

The gas recovered under this project  is almost 98% pure methane, which is being utilized to run  gas based generators to supply electricity to Moonidih mine  residential colony.
Significant  improvement has been achieved in both “coking  and non-coking coal washing” and “recovery of fine coals”.
Encouraging results have also been obtained from research  related to “combustion techniques” for effective utilization of  high-ash coals.
Major R&D projects on fine coal beneficiation  are under implementation through CIL R&D funding.
While  some research projects have produced tangible  impact on the industry directly, there are others, which have  strengthened mine planning, design and technical services  required by both operating mines and future mining projects.
A  number of research projects have been taken up in the area  of environment and ecology to integrate coal mining activities  with ecological conservation and hazards due to mining.
The  findings of these research projects have made a significant  impact on the industry resulting in the adoption of proper  environment control.
A study was carried on to determine  the free silica ( ½ -Quartz) content present in respirable air  borne dust in coal mines and after subsequent analysis in the  laboratory, a database software ALPHA-QUARTZ have been  developed for various parameters including free silica content  and other minerals present in respirable air borne dust as well  as in coal.
T o ensure the safety of human life and to protect loss of  equipment due to collision of dumpers in opencast mines,  Dumper Collision Avoidance System (DCAS) has been  developed indigenously.
The system is now in operation at  KDH opencast mine of Central coalfields Limited (CCL).
This  three-layer system consists of proximity sensors mounted on  dumpers on three sides to detect objects within 10m range,  distance and direction information of dumpers present in the  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 139 2016 - 2017 vicinity of 100m and also positional information of the dumper  through GPRS.
Under  the S&T grant of Ministry of Coal, Self-advancing goaf  edge (mobile) chock type supports have been developed and  were put into field trial at Bastacola mine of BCCL.
These self- propelled mobile supports of medium duty (2 x 200 Te.)
have  closed and extended height range of 1.85 to 3.2 m and can  offer support resistance of 71.4 T/ m2.
Under  an R&D project, the solar photovoltaic plant has been  commissioned on the roof tops of CMPDI office buildings.
The  total installed capacity of the plant is around 190kW, which is  at present generating 30% of total installed capacity.
Two types  of technologies, one with string inverter and another with micro  inverter have been adopted in installing the plant.
Under this  project, conventional grid (utility supply) clubbed with solar PV  system and DG sets through grid interactive inverters to feed  to internal grid (CMPDI) whenever utility grid (JSEB) supply is  not available.
In  additions to the above, following Coal research projects  have been completed during 2016-17: i)  De velopment of tele robotics and remote operation  technology for underground coal mines  Under  the project, tele-robot has been developed and field  trial conducted at Khottadih mine of ECL.
The developed  robot is capable of monitoring environmental parameters  viz.
percentage of CO2, CH 4 , O2, and also humidity &  temperature.
The real time graphical-user-interphase (GUI)  based navigational camera is capable of displaying the status  of robot and 3D representation of operational environment  in the underground mines from sensor data.
Long range  communication with the robot through multiple wireless routers  was also established.
ii)  De velopment of Indigenous catalyst through pilot scale  studies of Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) conversion technology  Design,  development, installation and commissioning of a  fully integrated Coal-to-Liquid Pilot Plant consisting of coal  gasification, gas cleaning, shift reaction, CO2 scrubbing,  liquefaction and liquid collection have been successfully  completed at the CIMFR, Digwadih Campus, Dhanbad.
The coal from Dabor OCP , Salanpur Area, ECL with ash  content of around 33% has been used for syngas production in  a fixed bed updraft air blown gasifier (Coal Feed rate Capacity:  50 – 100 kg/h).
Four on-stream experimental runs (continuous)  of total 857 hours have been conducted and three experimental  runs have produced hydrocarbon liquid.
Two Cobalt-based  catalyst have successfully been tested in the CTL pilot plant for  liquefaction reaction and one of them is a potential catalyst for  further scale up studies which has produced 47.0 litres of CTL  crude per tonne of coal.
The CTL crude is diesel equivalent with  the calorific value of 10900 kcal/kg.
Ho wever, as advised by Secretary (Coal), MoC, an independent  evaluation of the experimental data of CTL project by third party  is required to be carried out by CIMFR,Digwadih Campus,  Dhanbad.
iii)  Enhancing  life of de-watering pipes in coal/lignite mines  by prevention of erosion-corrosion with nano-crystalline  surface Engineering Treatments  Under  this project, six types of metallic coating and three types  of non-metallic (poly-urea coating) were developed for coating  on the Fe410 grade substrate for erosion and corrosion  resistance.
All combination of poly-urea coatings were found  to have extremely good corrosion resistance in all environment  as well as possess good erosion resistance.
On  comparing the cost-economics of both metallic and non- metallic coatings for mining application, it was found that the  poly-urea coatings were very cheap and economical and  the life of the coated pipelines will be approximately 6-10  years.
The poly-urea coated pipes were put into service in  different mines and periodic evaluation of these pipelines  was conducted by NITT and CARD officials.
The coating was  intact and the performance of the coating was found to be very  satisfactory.
The coating thickness was uniform throughout the  pipeline and no deterioration in the coating was noticed.

Also, ash, moisture and GCV of product &  rejects of each sample were determined & segregation of coal  products and rejects done based on the Gross Calorific Value  (GCV).
vii)  T o find a methodology of safe liquidation in thick seams  of Raniganj Coalfield: Design & development and show- casing demonstrative trials at Khottadih Colliery, ECL  This project has been executed by CIMFR, Dhanbad in  association with ECL.
The prime objective of the project is to  design a feasible and optimal method for safe liquidation of  coal in thick seams out of existing methods for extraction of  seam and to validate the same at the selected mine site at  COAL INDIA LIMITED 140 A Maharatna Company Khottadih project, Raniganj Coal Field, ECL.
While designing  and showcasing-demonstrative trials, the two important  aspects i.e.
ground control and fire-propensity aspects have  been taken into consideration in a way to increase the number  of coal pillars extraction.
The  above study was conducted in the trial panels of  Semi-Mechanized Mine (with SDL or LHD) and also with  a Continuous Miner (CM) deployment in Khottadih project.
Project has been completed and report is under preparation.
Under this project, following activities were carried out:  a)  Appro val to extract two sub-panels; panel B2A and B2B  in Khottadih, ECL was given by DGMS with the condition  that strata monitoring with a suit of geo-technical and  environmental monitoring to be undertaken by CIMFR.
b)  A  number of geotechnical instruments like remote  convergence indicators, stress meters, load cell and  instrumented rock bolts were installed in the panel B-2  (Sub-panel-A) during depillaring and observations were  taken.
The analysis shows ‘ no significant ‘ change of  ‘stress’ and ‘deformation’ that may be detrimental to safe  depillaring operations except the temporary hassles  related to the ‘main fall’.
Smooth and regular caving has  been achieved in B2B panel after gaining experience and  its implementation from the workings of B2A panel.
c)  The  tandem approach of extracting the panel including two  pronged assessment:    i.
Ground  control aspects of a safe liquidation method  with proper rib stability, controlled caving, strata  monitoring & management and    ii.
The  aspect related to detecting early symptom of  spontaneous heating/fire, followed by pro-active  application of remedial measures in order to prevent it     iii.
Fire ladder have been developed for the seam which  aids in early detection of fire.. viii)  De velopment of guidelines to predict distance between  toe of the shovel-dumper dump and that of dragline dump  with consideration of safety and economical design of  both shovel-dumper dump and dragline dump  This  project has been executed by BIT, Mesra, Ranchi.
The  prime objective of the project is to develop a general model  which would be applicable for other OC mines of CIL where  shovel and dragline dumps exists with due consideration of  safety and to reduce the land requirement to a certain extent  for external dumping in opencast excavation.
Under  the project, study has been conducted in twelve  opencast mines of CIL i.e.
i) Sasti OCP , WCL ii) Dudhichua  OCP , NCL iii) Khadia OCP , NCL iv) Jayant OCP ,NCL v) Bina  OCP ,NCLvi) Nigahi OCP ,NCL vii) Amlohri OCP ,NCL viii)  Sonepur Bazari OCP , ECL ix) Samleshwari, MCL x)Dhanpur,  SECL,xi) Ghughus OCP , WCL and xii) Block-II, BCCL for  determination of geo-engineering parameters for development  of guidelines to determine the optimum distance between toe  of dragline dumps and Shovel-Dumper-Dumps.
Based  on the study of individual dragline operated opencast  mines of CIL, a general guideline has been developed under  this project.
The guidelines can predict overall height and  slope of dragline dump depending on the range of various  geo-engineering parameters.
From the above study, it had  been concluded that the toe of shovel-dumper dump is formed  at least 110-180m away (site dependent) from the toe of the  dragline dump so that dragline dump gets adequate time to  stabilize before fresh dumping by dumper.
However, increase  in water table may deteriorate the dump stability.
ix)  Demonstration  of Coal Dry Beneficiation System using  Radiometric Technique.
This  project is under implementation by CMPDI, Ranchi,  Ardee Hi-Tech Pvt.
Ltd, Visakhapatnam and BCCL, Dhanbad.
The project aims at developing a demonstration plant for dry  deshaling of coal based on modified radiometric detection and  pneumatic removal technology.
The  proposed dry beneficiation technology is based on  radiometric detection and removal of stones and shale  from coal streams and works on the differential gamma ray  absorption properties of coal and ash forming minerals.
The  mass absorption coefficient of coal is dependent on the  chemical composition of coal and shale.
The distinct advantage  of radiometric technology is that the target for clean coal or  the threshold value for rejection can be planned and set as  per need.
This technology is an efficient, dust free and energy  friendly also.
Under  this project, it was proposed to take up this technology  at demonstration scale.
This project has been executed at  Madhuband Washery by installing two modules of ArdeeSort  for deshaling coals in the size fraction of 13mm-50mm (in two  stages i.e.13-25mm & 25-50mm).

T echnology Absorption:  CIL  has taken many technological initiatives in various fields  across its total operational activities.
In underground mining,  Mass Production Technology has been introduced in number  of mines.
Continuous Miner Technology has been introduced  in three mines of SECL in the last fiscal apart from seven  mines where the same is in operation.
Long-wall mining has  been started in Moonidih mine of BCCL.
So far as absorption  of this technology is concerned, it may be said that from  operational point of view, Mass Production Technology is fully  absorbed.
However, from services and spares point of view, the  company is still dependent on the service provider, since such  equipment are not yet manufactured in the country and also  sufficient number of skilled manpower trained in such category  is not available for maintenance of such equipment.
For the  first time in India, Free Steered Vehicles for transportation  of men and materials in underground have been introduced  in Jhanjhra mine of ECL.
Other mode of man-riding system  has been commissioned to reduce arduous walking of the  miners in several other extensive mines.
Biometric Attendance  System has been started in mines for eliminating the manual  interventions as well as reducing the requirement of additional  manpower.
Quick setting stoppings have been constructed in  case of fire in underground mines using expansion foam agent.
The  latest version of Geovia Minex software for planning of  opencast mines has been introduced.
This provides best  resource planning through pit design, pit optimization,  scheduling of resources and dumps etc.
Surface Miners in  several opencast mines have been introduced to eliminate  drilling and blasting and also for facilitating selective mining.
GPRS based tracking of coal transporting vehicles have  been introduced to prevent theft and pilferage of coal.
RFID  based In-Motion Road Weighbridges has ensured Real Time  transmission of coal weighment data to the Central Server.
This  has reduced the chances of fudging of coal production figures  on day to day basis.
For monitoring of coal quality, quantity  and loading time closely, CIL has introduced E-surveillance  by installation of CCTV , IP-cameras and control rooms in  most of the mines thereby avoiding demurrage charges to the  company.
Coalnet  system with different modules and integration of  weighbridges through LAN/WAN connection have been  introduced.
Electronic  procurement by the use of ICT has not only  facilitates procurement process for acquisition of goods, works  and services in various activities but also enhance the goodwill  of the company.
Through  the adoption of E-procurement and Auto Refund  of EMDs, CIL has achieved in reducing complaint regarding  delay in refund of EMDs to unsuccessful Bidders and also the  Bidders participation has gone up.
Hydrostatic  drills with PCD bits for enhancing the productivity  of exploratory drills have been introduced.
A project has been  taken up in association with NGRI, Hyderabad on “3-D Seismic  survey for coal in Belpahar sector of IB valley CF”.
The primary  objective is to have exposure in identifying lay and deposition  of coal seams in the surveyed area.
A  R&D project based on Radio-metric sorting technique, which  uses X-Ray for separation of impurities from coal, is currently  under implementation in Madhuband washery, BCCL.
The  project aims at developing a demonstration plant for dry  deshaling of coal based on modified radiometric detection  and pneumatic removal technology.
The project is likely to be  commissioned in 2016.

Benefits derived out of tec hnological initiatives undertaken:  With the introduction of Mass Production Technology in more  number of mines of CIL, sized coal is available and safety  standard have improved.
Introduction of Free Steered Vehicles  and other mode of Man riding Systems have definitely reduced  the travelling time and comfort of the workmen, thereby  improving the productivity.
Introduction of Biometric Attendance  System has eliminated the malpractices of marking false/proxy  attendance and also ensured full time working hours of the  workmen thereby improving the overall performance of the  company.
The system has also been integrated with Pay Roll  System and as such, requirement of clerical staff has also  been minimized.
Quick setting stoppings using expansion  foam agent could be built comfortably with less man-hours.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 143 2016 - 2017  Ov er the years, most optimum sizes of HEMMs are being  provisioned for opencast projects of India which are at par with  the World technology.
Due to use of latest software for planning  in OC mines, deployment of Electric Rope(ER) shovels of 42  Cum and dump trucks of 240 T were made during the last  few years for opencast projects, which is highest in sizes  proposed in India so far.
Use of surface miners has eliminated  drilling and blasting operations in the opencast projects and  as such, the problem of working very near to inhabited areas  has been sorted out due to elimination of blasting vibrations.
Moreover, because of possible selective mining, the chances  of contamination of produced coal with extraneous materials  has also been minimised.
GPRS based vehicle tracking  system has facilitated to monitor the movement of all the coal  transportations trucks and any deviation beyond the geo- fenced Area is detected online immediately.
This has helped in  curbing the pilferage of coal to a large extent.
Billing  of salary & wages, sales billing, material management  system, financial accounting, etc through Coalnet System,  have started.
which would improve the speed of the processes  with accuracy.
The  average productivity of departmental drills has increased  substantially due to introduction of hydrostatic drill.
The  outcome of project on “3-D Seismic survey for coal” will help  in evaluating 3-D seismic technology for coal exploration in  Indian scenario and its implementation in CIL.

Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on earth and industrial  greatness on coal has been built up by many countries.
It continues to be the cornerstone of any economy and a vital source of  energy for developing nations.
The economic development of the country largely depends on its industrial process.
The industrial  development of a country depends upon its possessing sufficiently large stock of this most valuable mineral product.
In  India, coal is the most important indigenous energy source and remains the most predominant fuel for power generation and  many industrial applications.
Coal is an important constituent of the present Indian economy.
India’s energy future and prosperity are  integrally dependent upon using its most abundant, affordable, dependent energy supply – which is coal.
Coal meets more than 50%  of India’s primary commercial energy.
India  is currently the third largest producer of coal in the world.
It produced around 6 million tonnes of coal a year in the beginning of  the 20th century.
Today, the total production stands at 660 million tonnes in FY2016-17, in sync with our developmental needs.
Coal  India Limited (CIL) is the single largest coal producing company in the world, with a total production of 554.14 million tonnes  during the fiscal 2016-17.
It accounted for 84% of total coal produced in India during the year.
It is a Maharatna Company, listed in  Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
CIL  is an apex body with 7 wholly-owned coal producing subsidiaries and 1 mine planning and Consultancy Company, spread across  8 states in India.
CIL also fully owns a mining company in Mozambique christened as ‘Coal India Africana Limitada’.

CIL ’s growth plan for the future is in  synergy with the ambitious plan of the Government for round the clock power supply to all homes of the Country.
Sustainability of  such growth by minimizing the environmental impact being a major issue, thrust is given in qualitative improvement in coal production  through selective mining, beneficiation and blending.
CIL  has envisaged coal production and off-take target of 600 Mt in 2017-18.
75% of the said production would be consumed by  power sector only.
A roadmap to achieve more than 900Mt of coal production by 2019-20 has also been prepared in its vision to  achieve one billion tonne.
This would call for developing matching logistics infrastructure.
Apart from creating new infrastructure,  optimum utilization of existing capacity through a dynamic process of source rationalization is another key area of activity.
By means  of launching linkage auction scheme, an in-built system of source rationalization has already been put in place for non-regulated  sector.
CIL is also exploring opportunities to diversify coal into chemical business.
This is to ensure greater value addition and thereby  improving financial performance of the company, and ensuring long term coal demand.
CIL  has planned a capital investment of ` 8500 crores for maintaining its volume growth in 2017-18.
In addition, the company has  also envisaged investment of ` 6500 crores in 2017-18 for development of railway infrastructure project, solar power, Coal Bed  Methane (CBM), revival of fertilizer plants and for acquisitions of domestic coal blocks & coal blocks abroad etc.
Further, CIL plans  to significantly ramp up its investment programme in the next five years also.
Marketing Outlook:  The  Working Group on Coal and Lignite, during the formulation of XII Plan document, projected a widening gap between   demand and indigenous availability of coal to the tune of 273 Mt by 2021-22.
The present production roadmap of 908.10Mt   COAL INDIA LIMITED 178 A Maharatna Company from CIL sources by 2019-20 would substantially reduce the gap.
It is envisaged that barring the import of coking coal, essentially  for quality reasons, India will be self-sufficient in meeting the requirements of thermal coal by 2019-20.
Non-Coking Coal   imports in the country had declined by 7.07Mt from 156.38 Mt in 2015-16 to 149.31 Mt in 2016-17 resulting in substantial foreign  exchange savings.
CIL  has also taken an initiative to build logistics infrastructure to ensure evacuation of planned quantity of production.
The following  activities have already been initiated to augment rail evacuation capacity: 1.
Joint  Ventures (JVs) have been incorporated by coal companies with State Governments and Railways for creating rail  infrastructure.
2.
Three  major last mile rail connectivity projects at Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have been brought under  PMO  Monitoring Mechanism to ensure commissioning as per schedule.
In  order to provide a transparent platform to plan coal procurement by end-users in the medium and long term, windows for linkage  auction in electronic platform for non-regulated sectors have been made operative in addition to the usual spot and forward e-auctions  to mitigate short-term and seasonal coal requirement for different consuming sectors.
Forward auction is now conducted in two  different segments – for power, named as ‘Special Forward Auction for Power, and for non-power, named as Exclusive Forward  Auction for non-power sectors.
Customer  satisfaction through quality assurance is another key area for improvement.
Following initiatives are identified towards  quality improvement and assurance: a)  Supply of (-) 100 mm siz ed coal to power sector consumers w.e.f.
1st Jan’16.
b)  Third par ty sampling facility.
c)  All  major laboratories across the subsidiaries of coal companies are now equipped with the Automatic “Bomb Calorimeter” for  ascertaining calorific value.
d)  NABL accreditation of field le vel laboratories.
Operations Outlook:  CIL  has identified 120 on-going projects and 65 future/new projects, which will together contribute about 80% of total coal production  envisaged for 2019-20.
SECL, MCL, NCL and CCL will be the major contributors.
The  expansion programme will be managed in a structured manner with the help of IT enabled actions.
The implementation of ERP  solution to enable transparency in operations, maintenance and support functions is being undertaken.
The  Company has already conducted a study for mechanization and automation level across a substantial number of mines.
This  is aimed at identification of opportunities in mine planning, exploration, survey, operations and maintenance and are under different  phases of implementation.
T o support increase in production on a sustainable basis, synergic growth in exploration is absolutely necessary.
Increased use of  hydrostatic drilling with PCD bits and 2D Seismic Survey Technology to achieve high rate in exploration has been envisaged.
CIL will  continue to focus on increasing its reserve base in India.
CIL  is in the process of augmenting the capacity of training institutes across subsidiaries, including IICM.
Several actions for building  human resource capacity are being contemplated in collaboration with reputed institutions.
Outlook regar ding Evolution of the Ecosystem:  CIL ’s projected coal production in the coming years will be materialized only by working closely with other stakeholders.
These  include  Indian Railways, State Governments, Regulators, Community and other market participants.
CIL ’s initiatives towards this  endeavour are as under: 1.
MCL  has formed a SPV ,Mahanadi Basin Power Limited (MBPL), with 100% stake held by them for power generation capacity  of 2X800 MW through pit-head Power Plant at Basundhara Coalfields.
2.
T o promote, Green Initiatives taken by GoI, CIL has submitted Green Energy Commitment letter to MNRE for developing  1000 MW Solar Power Projects.
For implementation of these projects, CIL has signed MoU with Solar Energy Corporation of  India(SECI).In the 1st phase, tender was floated for setting up of 2x100 MW Solar PV Project in the state of Madhya Pradesh.
But, due to current downward trend in prices of solar projects and availability of land in Madhya Pradesh Solar Park the tenders  were cancelled and SECI was advised to go for re-tendering of above projects.
3.
CIL  is also working closely with the Government of Jharkhand and West Bengal for quick implementation of Master Action Plan  of Jharia and Raniganj Coalfields.
4.
In  pursuance of initiatives towards development of Clean Coal Technology and alternate use of coal, it has been decided to  explore the possibilities of setting-up of a coal based Methanol plant using coal from Raniganj Coalfield at DCC.
An Expression  of Interest has been floated for prequalification of Coal gasification Technology licensors with proven experience of gasifying  coal having up to 28% ash content.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 179 2016 - 2017  Resear ch & Development  CMPDIL is the nodal agency for coordination and monitoring of S&T projects in the coal sector as well as the R&D projects of CIL.

Ref erence to Note(s) in the following paragraphs refers to the notes to the financial statements of CIL (consolidated) for the financial  year 2016-17 placed elsewhere in this report.
(F or constituents of CIL Consolidated Refer Note 38.2)  A detailed discussion on financial perf ormance and analysis is furnished below.
Total Income:  T otal Income of the Company comprises Revenue from operations and other Income.
Major revenue of the company under above  two heads of total income includes income from sale of coal, consultancy and other services related to mine planning & designing,  interest earned on investments such as term deposits with banks, dividend income from mutual funds etc.
The total income for  financial Y ear 2016-17 is `89323.73 crore as against `89501.56 crore in the previous year registering a decrease of 0.20%.
The  breakup of major elements of income is discussed below: (` in crores) Particulars FY 2016-17 FY 2015-16 Change % Sale of Coal 122294.46 108147.54 13.08% Less: Statutory Levies [Excluding Excise] 41240.33 27075.86 52.31% Net Sales 81054.13 81071.68 -0.02% Other Operating Revenue (Net) 2754.00 2489.30 10.63% Revenue from Operations 83808.13 83560.98 0.30% Other Income 5515.60 5940.58 -7.15% Total Income 89323.73 89501.56 -0.20% COAL INDIA LIMITED 180 A Maharatna Company  Re venue from Operations:  Sale of Coal  Sales  are presented as gross sales and net of various statutory levies comprising royalty, cess on coal, central sales tax, stowing  excise duty, clean energy cess, sales tax, additional royalties relating to national mineral exploration trust (NMET), district mineral  foundation (DMF) and other levies etc.
but excluding excise duty (following the clarification issued by SEBI the excise duty is to be  included in revenue from operations and therefore to be shown as an item of expenditure).
Excise duty therefore has been shown as  a part of Gross/Net Sales.
The Income from sale of coal is mainly dependent on the pricing and production of coal and distribution  thereof.
The  gross sales of the company which exceeded the landmark figure of ` One Lac crore in year 2015-16 has further registered a  growth of  13.08% over the previous year and stood at ` 122294.46 crores against the previous year gross sales of `108147.54 crore.
The Net sales (excluding excise) however, for the year was ` 75610.36 crore against the previous year figure of ` 75641.78 crore,  thereby registering a decline of 0.04%.
The Gross sales increased mainly owing to incidence of higher levies by way of clean energy  cess, National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET), District Mineral Foundation (DMF).
The  clean energy cess was raised from `200 per tonne to `400 per tonne w.e.f.
01.03.2016.
There was a similar increase to `200  per tonne from `100 per tonne w.e.f.
01.03.2015.
Further there were also introduction of new levies administered through MMDR  Act under the nomenclature- National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) & District Mineral Foundation (DMF) at a combined rate of  around 4.48% on basic value of coal sold.
Changes/introduction in aforesaid levies resulted in substantial increase in statutory levies  and thereby in Gross sales.
About  79% of coal was sold under notified price to customers having fuel supply agreements (power and other than power both  included) and sale of beneficiated coal (washed coal) and other by products was around 3% through negotiated price with customers  About 18% of total coal sold was through e-auction mechanism, the price determination of which is completely dependent on market  dynamics.
T otal offtake during 2016-17 increased to 543.32 million tonne from 534.50 million tonne in previous year, registering a growth over  1.65%.
Ho wever, despite growth in offtake the net sales revenue excluding excise duty showed a decline of 0.04% as shown below: Particulars FY 2016-17 FY 2015-16 Change % Net sales (including excise) 81054.13 81071.68 -0.02% Less: Excise Duty (relating to sale of coal) 5443.77 5429.90 0.26% Net Sales (excluding excise) 75610.36 75641.78 -0.04%  The  decline was mainly owing to the decrease in average realization of coal sales through e-auction.
The average fall in e-auction  price was around ` 322/ton i.e.
to `1536/ton in FY 2016-17 from `1858/ton in FY  2015-16, resulting in decrease in sales of about   ` 3032 crore.
Further, there was also decrease in FSA sales quantity from 447.72 Mill Te.
in previous year to 429.79 Mill Te.
in current  year i.e.
by 17.93 Mill Te.
This accounted for decrease in sales revenue of around ` 2350 Crore.
However, increase in e-auction  volume by around 28 MT (i.e.
from 66.31 Mill Te in PY to 94.23 Mill Te in CY) has resulted in an increase in sales by ` 5188 crore.
The above along with increase in sales realisation in washed coal and other by products resulted in a marginal decline in net sales  revenue (net of excise and all other levies) by ` 31.42 Crore.
Other Operating Re venue:  The  company charges transportation costs for transportation of coal to dispatch points beyond 3 kilometers from the pithead, based  on distance involved.
Major element of other operating revenue is on account of such transportation charges recovered from the  customers.
F ollowing the same SEBI circular mentioned above for including excise duty in revenue from operation; ‘loading and additional  transportation charges’ were shown including excise duty.
The revenue from loading and additional transportation charges were as  follows: (` in crores) Particulars 2016-17 2015-16 Loading and additional transporatation charges (including Excise Duty) 2627.16 2362.07 Less: Excise Duty 143.75 123.45 Loading and additional transporatation charges (excluding Excise Duty) 2483.41 2238.62  Other oper ating revenue also includes Subsidy for sand stowing & protective works received from Govt.
of India.
Other Income  Other  income primarily includes (i) interest income from deposits with banks (including certain earmarked funds)  (ii) Dividend from  mutual funds, (iii) any liquidated damages or penalty payments by our suppliers, customers and third party contractors.
Other income  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 181 2016 - 2017 also includes rental income and any profit on sale of assets.
Other income further includes any write back of provisions and liabilities  made in earlier years which are no longer required.
Dur ing the year other income declined by 7.15% from ` 5940.58 crore in FY 2015-16 to ` 5515.60 crore in FY 2016-17.
While  the interest earning on bank deposits declined by ` 1345.35 crore, the earning from dividend on investment in mutual funds  declined from `263.61 Crore to ` 194.49 Crore.
The above decline was mainly owing to reduction in average investment in bank  deposits and due to decline in average rate of yield from bank deposits/mutual funds.

While during the year, the  coal production increased by 2.86% (from 538.75 Mill Te in 2015-16 to 554.14 Mill Te in 2016-17) the overburden removal volume  increased by 0.98 % (from 1148.91 Mill CuM in 2015-16 to1160.22 Mill CuM in 2016-17).
The increase in contractual expenses  was largely on account of increase in the volume of production of coal and over burden.
Further, higher diesel rates during the year  in comparison to previous year also resulted in increase in contractual expenses.
It may be mentioned that the contractors as per  agreement are compensated for diesel price increases.
Repairs  Repairs  consist of cost of repair and maintenance of plant and machinery relating to our operations, rehabilitation of heavy  earthmoving machinery, office equipment, vehicles and other miscellaneous assets.

The net of balances of stripping activity  asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as Stripping Activity Adjustment under the head Non-Current Provisions/  Other Non-Current Assets as the case may be.
The  Stripping Activity adjustment (cost) varies from subsidiary to subsidiary depending on geo-mining condition of raising the  overburden.
During the year owing to higher incremental growth in overburden removal compared to incremental growth of production  of coal, there was reduction in stripping activity adjustment in some of the subsidiary companies.
In view of above, the Stripping  Activity adjustment decreased by ` 139.21 crore, from ` 2811.42 crore in FY 2015-16 to ` 2672.21 crore in FY 2016-17, i.e.

Other  expenditure also includes Royalty & Cess and Excise Duty payable on own consumptions including feedstock to washeries.
These costs form part of the washery cost and are recovered through washeries sales revenue.

These financial statements for the year ended 31st  March 2017 are the first financial statements of the  Company prepared in accordance with Ind AS.
Refer  to Note no.38.6 for information on first time adoption  of Ind AS.
The  financial statements have been prepared on  historical cost basis of measurement, except for   •  cer tain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair  value (refer accounting policy on financial instruments  in para 2.14);  •  Defined  benefit plans- plan assets measured at fair  value;  •  In ventories at Cost or NRV whichever is lower (refer  accounting policy in para no.
2.20).
2.1.1  Rounding of amounts     Amounts  in these financial statements have,  unless otherwise indicated, have been rounded  off to ‘rupees in crore ’upto two decimal points.
2.2  Current and non-current Classification     The  Company presents assets and liabilities in  the Balance Sheet based on current/ non-current  classification.
An asset is treated as current by the  Company when:  (a)  it  expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or  consume it, in its normal operating cycle;   (b)  it holds the asset pr imarily for the purpose of trading;   (c)  it  expects to realise the asset within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)  the  asset is cash or a cash equivalent (as defined in  Ind AS 7) unless the asset is restricted from being  exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least  twelve months after the reporting period.
All other  assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is treated as current b y the Company when:   (a)  it  expects to settle the liability in its normal operating  cycle;   (b)  it  holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;   (c)  the  liability is due to be settled within twelve months  after the reporting period; or   (d)  it  does not have an unconditional right to defer  settlement of the liability for at least twelve months  after the reporting period.
Terms of a liability that  could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its  settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not  affect its classification.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
2.3  Re venue recognition    2.3.1Re venue from sale of goods     Re venue from the sale of goods is recognised  when all the following conditions have been  satisfied:     (a)  the  Company has transferred to the buyer the  significant risks and rewards of ownership of the  goods;    (b)  the  Company retains neither continuing  managerial involvement to the degree usually  associated with ownership nor effective control  over the goods sold;    (c)  the amount of re venue can be measured reliably;    (d)  it  is probable that the economic benefits  associated with the transaction will flow to the  Company; and    (e)  the  costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of  the transaction can be measured reliably.
Re venue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable, taking into  account contractually defined terms of payment  and excluding taxes, levies or duties collected on  behalf of the government/ other statutory bodies.
Adv ances received from the customers are reported  as customer’s deposits unless the above conditions  for revenue recognition are met.
Ho wever, based on the educational material on  Ind AS 18 issued by The Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India, the Company has assumed  that recovery of excise duty flows to the Company  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 201 2016 - 2017 on its own account.
This is for the reason that it is  a liability of the manufacturer which forms part of  the cost of production, irrespective of whether the  goods are sold or not.
Since the recovery of excise  duty flows to the Company on its own account,  gross revenue includes excise duty.
Ho wever, other taxes, levies or duties are not  considered to be received by the Company on its  own account and are excluded from net revenue.

2.3.3 Dividend     Dividend  income from investments is recognised  when the rights to receive payment is established.

The outcome of a transaction  can be estimated reliably when all the following  conditions are satisfied:     (a)  the amount of re venue can be measured reliably;    (b)  it  is probable that the economic benefits associated  with the transaction will flow to the Company;    (c)  the  stage of completion of the transaction at the  end of the reporting period can be measured  reliably; and    (d)  the  costs incurred for the transaction and the costs  to complete the transaction can be measured  reliably.
2.4  Grants fr om Government    Go vernment Grants are not recognised until there is  reasonable assurance that the company will comply  with the conditions attached to them and that there is  reasonable certainty that grants will be received.
Go vernment grants are recognised in Statement of  Profit & Loss on a systematic basis over the periods  in which the company recognises as expenses the  related costs for which the grants are intended to  compensate.
Go vernment Grants related to assets are presented in  the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred  income and are recognised in Statement of Profit and  Loss on systematic basis over the useful life of asset.
Gr ants related to income (i.e.
grant related to other  than assets) are presented as part of statement of  profit and loss under the head ‘Other Income’.
A  government grant/assistance that becomes  receivable as compensation for expenses or losses  already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate  financial support to the Company with no future related  costs, is recognised in profit or loss of the period in  which it becomes receivable.
The  Government grants or grants in the nature  of promoter’s contribution are recognised directly  in “Capital Reserve” which forms part of the  “Shareholders fund”.
2.5 Leases    A  finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially  all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an  asset.
Title may or may not eventually be transferred.
An  operating lease is a lease other than a finance  lease.
2.5.1  Compan y as a lessee     A  lease is classified at the inception date as a  finance lease or an operating lease.
2.5.1.1  Finance  leases are capitalised at the  commencement of the lease at the inception date  fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the  present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance  charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to  achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the  remaining balance of the liability.
Finance  charges are recognised in finance costs  in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are  directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which  case they are capitalized in accordance with the  Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs.
A  leased asset is depreciated over the useful life  of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable  certainty that the Company will obtain ownership  by the end of the lease term, the asset is  depreciated over the shorter of the estimated  useful life of the asset and the lease term.
2.5.1.2  Oper ating lease - Lease payments under an  operating lease is recognised as an expense on  a straight-line basis over the lease term unless  either:     (a)  another  systematic basis is more representative  of the time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the  payments to the lessors are not on that basis; or     (b)  the  payments to the lessor are structured to  increase in line with expected general inflation to  compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary  cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary  because of factors other than general inflation,  then this condition is not met.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 202 A Maharatna Company  2.5.2  Compan y as a lessor   2.5.2.1  Operating leasesLease income from operating  leases (excluding amounts for services such as  insurance and maintenance) is recognised in  income on a straight-line basis over the lease  term, unless either:     (a)  another  systematic basis is more representative  of the time pattern in which use benefit derived  from the leased asset is diminished, even if the  payments to the lessors are not on that basis; or     (b)  the  payments to the lessor are structured to  increase in line with expected general inflation to  compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary  cost increases.
If payments to the lessor vary  according to factors other than inflation, then this  condition is not met.
Initial  direct costs incurred in negotiating and  arranging an operating lease are added to  the carrying amount of the leased asset and  recognised as an expense over the initial lease  term on the same basis as lease income.
2.5.2.2  Finance leases Amounts due fr om lessees  under finance leases are recorded as  receivables at the Company’s net investment  in the leases.
Finance lease income is  allocated to accounting periods so as to  reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the  net investment outstanding in respect of the  lease.
2.6  Non-current assets held f or sale     The  Company classifies non-current assets and  (or disposal groups) as held for sale if their carrying  amounts will be recovered principally through a  sale rather than through continuing use.
Actions  required to complete the sale should indicate that it   is unlikely that significant changes to the sale  will be made or that the decision to sell will be  withdrawn.
Management must be committed to  the sale expected within one year from the date   of classification.
F or these purposes, sale transactions include  exchanges of non-current assets for other non- current assets when the exchange has commercial  substance.
The criteria for held for sale classification is  regarded met only when the assets or disposal group  is available for immediate sale in its present condition,  subject only to terms that are usual and customary  for sales of such assets (or disposal groups), its sale  is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not  abandoned.
The Company treats sale of the asset or  disposal group to be highly probable when:     •  The  appropriate level of management is committed  to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),     •  An  active programme to locate a buyer and  complete the plan has been initiated     •  The  asset (or disposal group) is being actively  marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in  relation to its current fair value,     •  The  sale is expected to qualify for recognition as  a completed sale within one year from the date of  classification, and     •  Actions  required to complete the plan indicate that  it is unlikely those significant changes to the plan  will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
2.7  Pr operty, Plant and Equipment (PPE)    Land  is carried at historical cost.
Historical cost  includes expenditure which are directly attributable  to the acquisition of the land like, rehabilitation  expenses, resettlement cost and compensation in  lieu of employment incurred for concerned displaced  persons etc.
After  recognition, an item of all other Property,  plant and equipment are carried at its cost less any  accumulated depreciation and any accumulated  impairment losses under Cost Model.
The cost of an  item of property, plant and equipment comprises:    (a)  its  purchase price, including import duties and  non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting  trade discounts and rebates.
(b)  an y costs directly attributable to bringing the asset  to the location and condition necessary for it to be  capable of operating in the manner intended by  management.
(c)  the  initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and  removing the item and restoring the site on which  it is located, the obligation for which the Company  incurs either when the item is acquired or as a  consequence of having used the item during  a particular period for purposes other than to  produce inventories during that period.
Each  part of an item of property, plant and equipment  with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost  of the item depreciated separately.
However, significant  part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful life and  depreciation method are grouped together in determining  the depreciation charge.
Costs  of the day to-day servicing described as for the  ‘repairs and maintenance’ are recognised in the statement  of profit and loss in the period in which the same are  incurred.
Subsequent  cost of replacing parts significant in relation to  the total cost of an item of property, plant and equipment  are recognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the  item will flow to the Company; and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of those parts  that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the  derecognition policy mentioned below.
When  major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised  in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and  equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will flow to  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 203 2016 - 2017 the Company; and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the  previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is  derecognised.
An  item of Property, plant or equipment is derecognised  upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected from the continued use of assets.
Any gain or  loss arising on such derecognition of an item of property  plant and equipment is recognised in profit and Loss.
Depreciation  on property, plant and equipment, except  freehold land, is provided as per cost model on straight  line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as  follows: Other Land (incl.
Leasehold Land) : Life of the project or lease  term whichever is lower  Building : 3-60 years Roads : 3-10 years  Telecommunication : 3-9 years Railway Sidings : 15 years Plant and Equipment : 5-15 years Computers and Laptops : 3 Y ears Office equipment : 3-6 years Furniture and Fixtures : 10 years Vehicles: 8-10 years  Based  on technical evaluation, the management believes  that the useful lives given above best represents the  period over which the management expects to use the  asset.
Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different  from useful lives as prescribed under Part C of schedule II  of companies act, 2013.
The  estimated useful life of the assets is reviewed at the  end of each financial year.
The  residual value of Property, plant and equipment is  considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset except  some items of assets such as, Coal tub, winding ropes,  haulage ropes, stowing pipes & safety lamps etc.
for which  the technically estimated useful life has been determined  to be one year with nil residual value.
Depreciation  on the assets added / disposed of during the  year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the  month of addition / disposal.
V alue of “Other Land” includes land acquired under  Coal Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA)  Act, 1957, Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Right to Fair  Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,  Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013,  Long term transfer of government land etc., which is  amortised on the basis of the balance life of the project;  and in case of Leasehold land such amortisation is based  on lease period or balance life of the project whichever is  lower.
Fully  depreciated assets, retired from active use are  disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its residual  value under Property, plant and Equipment and are tested  for impairment.
Capital Expenses incurred by the company on  construction/development of certain assets which are  essential for production, supply of goods or for the access  to any existing Assets of the company are recognised as  Enabling Assets under Property, Plant and Equipment.
T ransition to Ind AS  The  company elected to continue with the carrying value as  per cost model for all of its property, plant and equipment  as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of  transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP .
2.8  Mine Closure , Site Restoration and  Decommissioning Obligation    The  company’s obligation for land reclamation and  decommissioning of structures consists of spending  at both surface and underground mines in accordance  with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government  of India.
The company estimates its obligation for Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning based  upon detailed calculation and technical assessment of  the amount and timing of the future cash spending to  perform the required work.
Mine Closure expenditure  is provided as per approved Mine Closure Plan.
The  estimates of expenses are escalated for inflation, and  then discounted at a discount rate that reflects current  market assessment of the time value of money and  the risks, such that the amount of provision reflects  the present value of the expenditures expected to be  required to settle the obligation.
The company records  a corresponding asset associated with the liability for  final reclamation and mine closure.
The obligation and  corresponding assets are recognised in the period in  which the liability is incurred.
The asset representing  the total site restoration cost (as estimated by Central  Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per  mine closure plan is recognised as a separate item in  PPE and amortised over the balance project/mine life.
The  value of the provision is progressively increased  over time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating  an expense recognised as financial expenses.
Further, a specific escrow fund account is maintained  for this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.
The progressive mine closure expenses incurred  on year to year basis forming part of the total mine  closure obligation is initially recognised as receivable  from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the  obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn  after the concurrence of the certifying agency.
2.9  Exploration and Ev aluation Assets    Explor ation and evaluation assets comprise capitalised  costs which are attributable to the search for coal  and related resources, pending the determination of  technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial  viability of an identified resource which comprises inter  alia the following:    •  researching and analysing historical exploration data;   •  gather ing exploration data through topographical,  geo chemical and geo physical studies; COAL INDIA LIMITED 204 A Maharatna Company   •  e xploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;    •  deter mining and examining the volume and grade  of the resource;    •  sur veying transportation and infrastructure  requirements;    •  Conducting mar ket and finance studies.
The  above includes employee remuneration, cost of  materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.
As  the intangible component represents an  insignificant/indistinguishable portion of the overall  expected tangible costs to be incurred and recouped  from future exploitation, these costs along with  other capitalised exploration costs are recorded as  exploration and evaluation asset.
Explor ation and evaluation costs are capitalised on  a project by project basis pending determination of  technical feasibility and commercial viability of the  project and disclosed as a separate line item under  non-current assets.
They are subsequently measured  at cost less accumulated impairment/provision.
Once  proved reserves are determined and  development of mines/project is sanctioned,  exploration and evaluation assets are transferred  to “Development” under capital work in progress.
However, if proved reserves are not determined, the  exploration and evaluation asset is derecognised.
2.10De velopment Expenditure   When proved reserves are determined and  development of mines/project is sanctioned, capitalised  exploration and evaluation cost is recognised as assets  under construction and disclosed as a component of  capital work in progress under the head “Development”.
All subsequent development expenditure is also  capitalised.
The development expenditure capitalised is  net of proceeds from the sale of coal extracted during  the development phase.
Commer cial Operation    The  project/mines are brought to revenue; when  commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield  production on a sustainable basis is established either  on the basis of conditions specifically stated in the  project report or on the basis of the following criteria:  (a)  F rom beginning of the financial year immediately after  the year in which the project achieves physical output  of 25% of rated capacity as per approved project  report, or  (b)  2 y ears of touching of coal, or  (c)  F rom the beginning of the financial year in which the  value of production is more than total, expenses.
Whiche ver event occurs first;    On  being brought to revenue, the assets under capital  work in progress are reclassified as a component of  property, plant and equipment under the nomenclature  “Other Mining Infrastructure”.
Other Mining  Infrastructure are amortised from the year when the  mine is brought under revenue in 20 years or working  life of the project whichever is less.
2.11Intangib le Assets    Intangib le assets acquired separately are measured  on initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible  assets acquired in a business combination is their  fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following initial  recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation (calculated on  a straight-line basis over their useful lives) and  accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Inter nally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not capitalised.
Instead, the  related expenditure is recognised in the statement  of profit and loss and other comprehensive income  in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as  either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite  lives are amortised over their useful economic lives  and assessed for impairment whenever there is an  indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method  for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are  reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected  pattern of consumption of future economic benefits  embodied in the asset are considered to modify the  amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and  are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
The  amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite  lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
An  intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is  not amortised but is tested for impairment at each  reporting date.
Gains  or losses arising from derecognition of an  intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying  amount of the asset and are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss    Explor ation and Evaluation assets attributable to  blocks identified for sale or proposed to be sold to  outside agencies (i.e.
for blocks not earmarked for  CIL) are however, classified as Intangible Assets and  tested for impairment.
Cost  of Software recognized as intangible asset, is  amortised on straight line method over a period of  legal right to use or three years, whichever is less; with  a nil residual value.
2.12Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets)    The  Company assesses at the end of each reporting  period whether there is any indication that an asset  may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the recoverable amount of the  asset.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of  the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use and  its fair value less costs of disposal, and is determined  for an individual asset, unless the asset does not  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 205 2016 - 2017 generate cash inflows that are largely independent  of those from other assets or groups of assets, in  which case the recoverable amount is determined for  the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Company considers individual mines as separate cash  generating units for the purpose of test of impairment.
If  the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to  be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and  the impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.
2.13In vestment Property    Proper ty (land or a building or part of a building or  both) held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or  both, rather than for, use in the production or supply  of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or  sale in the ordinary course of businesses are classified  as investment property.
In vestment property is measured initially at its  cost, including related transaction costs and where  applicable borrowing costs.
In vestment properties are depreciated using the  straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
2.14Financial Instruments    A  financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to  a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or  equity instrument of another entity.
2.14.1 Financial assets  2.14.1 Initial recognition and measurement      All  financial assets are recognised initially at fair  value, in the case of financial assets not recorded  at fair value through profit or loss, plus transaction  costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the  financial asset.
Purchases or sales of financial  assets that require delivery of assets within a time  frame established by regulation or convention  in the market place (regular way trades) are  recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the  Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
2.14.2 Subsequent measurement      F or purposes of subsequent measurement,  financial assets are classified in four categories:     •  Debt instr uments at amortised cost    •  Debt  instruments at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI)     •  Debt  instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments at fair value through profit or loss  (FVTPL)     •  Equity  instruments measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)   2.14.2.1 Debt instruments at amor tised cost      A  ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met:    a)  The asset is held within a business model whose  objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual  cash flows, and     b)  Contr actual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.
After  initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into  account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the  EIR.
The EIR amortisation is included in finance  income in the profit or loss.
The losses arising from  impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.
2.14.2.2 Debt instrument at FVT OCI      A  ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met:     a)  The  objective of the business model is achieved  both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets, and     b)  The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value.
Fair value movements  are recognized in the other comprehensive  income (OCI).
However, the Company recognizes  interest income, impairment losses & reversals  and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.
On  derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss  previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from  the equity to P&L.
Interest earned whilst holding  FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest  income using the EIR method.
2.14.2.3 Debt instrument at FVTPL     FVTPL  is a residual category for debt instruments.
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the  criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or  as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In  addition, the Company may elect to designate a  debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized  cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.
However,  such election is allowed only if doing so reduces  or eliminates a measurement or recognition  inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting  mismatch’).
The Companyhas not designated any  debt instrument as at FVTPL.
Debt  instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.
2.14.2.4 Equity in vestments in subsidiaries, associates  and Joint Ventures     In  accordance of Ind AS 101 (First time adoption of  Ind AS), the carrying amount of these investments  COAL INDIA LIMITED 206 A Maharatna Company as per previous GAAP as on the date of transition  is considered to be the deemed cost.
Subsequently  Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures are measured at cost.
2.14.2.5 Other Equity In vestment     All other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
F or all other equity instruments, the Company may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes in  the fair value.
The Company makes such election  on an instrument by-instrument basis.
The  classification is made on initial recognition and is  irrevocable.
If  the Company decides to classify an equity  instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes on the instrument, excluding dividends,  are recognized in the OCI.
There is no recycling  of the amounts from OCI to P&L even on sale of  investment.
However, the Company may transfer  the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity  instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.
2.14.2.6 Derecognition     A  financial asset (or, where applicable, a part  of a financial asset or part of a group of similar  financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e.
removed from the balance sheet) when:     •  The  rights to receive cash flows from the asset  have expired, or     •  The  Companyhas transferred its rights to receive  cash flows from the asset or has assumed an  obligation to pay the received cash flows in full  without material delay to a third party under a  ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the  Company has transferred substantially all the  risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company  has neither transferred nor retained substantially  all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has  transferred control of the asset.
When the Company has transferred its rights to  receive cash flows from an asset or has entered  into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and  to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards  of ownership.
When it has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of  the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the  Company continues to recognise the transferred  asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing  involvement.
In that case, the Company also  recognises an associated liability.
The transferred  asset and the associated liability are measured  on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations  that the Company has retained.
Continuing  involvement that takes the form of a guarantee  over the transferred asset is measured at the lower  of the original carrying amount of the asset and  the maximum amount of consideration that the  Company could be required to repay.
2.14.2.7 Impairment of financial assets (other than fair  value)     In  accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company  applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for  measurement and recognition of impairment loss  on the following financial assets and credit risk  exposure:     a)  Financial  assets that are debt instruments, and  are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt  securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank  balance     b)  Financial  assets that are debt instruments and are  measured as at FVTOCI     c)  Lease receiv ables under Ind AS 17     d)  T rade receivables or any contractual right to  receive cash or another financial asset that result  from transactions that are within the scope of Ind  AS 11 and Ind AS 18      The  Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on:     •    Trade receivables or contract revenue receivables;  and     •    All lease receivables resulting from transactions  within the scope of Ind AS 17      The  application of simplified approach does not  require the Company to track changes in credit risk.
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance  based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date,  right from its initial recognition.
2.14.3 Financial liabilities  2.14.3.1 Initial recognition and measurement      The  Company’s financial liabilities include  trade and other payables, loans and borrowings  including bank overdrafts.
All  financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair  value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and  payables, net of directly attributable transaction  costs.
2.14.3.2 Subsequent measurement      The  measurement of financial liabilities depends  on their classification, as described below:   2.14.3.3 Financial liabilities at fair v alue through profit  or loss     Financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss include financial liabilities held for trading  and financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition as at fair value through profit or  loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held  for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 207 2016 - 2017 repurchasing in the near term.
This category also  includes derivative financial instruments entered  into by the Company that are not designated as  hedging instruments in hedge relationships as  defined by Ind AS 109.
Separated embedded  derivatives are also classified as held for trading  unless they are designated as effective hedging  instruments.
Gains  or losses on liabilities held for trading are  recognised in the profit or loss.
Financial liabilities designated upon initial  recognition at fair value through profit or loss are  designated as such at the initial date of recognition,  and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value  gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit  risk are recognized in OCI.
These gains/ loss are  not subsequently transferred to P&L.
However, the  Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss  within equity.
All other changes in fair value of such  liability are recognised in the statement of profit and  loss.
The Company has not designated any financial  liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
2.14.3.4 Financial liabilities at amor tised cost     After  initial recognition, these are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest rate method.
Gains and losses are  recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are  derecognised as well as through the effective  interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost  is calculated by taking into account any discount or  premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are  an integral part of the effective interest rate.
The  effective interest rate amortisation is included as  finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
This  category generally applies to borrowings.
2.14.3.5 Derecognition     A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged or  cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial  liability is replaced by another from the same  lender on substantially different terms, or the terms  of an existing liability are substantially modified,  such an exchange or modification is treated as  the derecognition of the original liability and the  recognition of a new liability.
The difference between  the carrying amount of a financial liability (or part  of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to  another party and the consideration paid, including  any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities  assumed, shall be recognised in profit or loss.
2.14.4 Rec lassification of financial assets     The Company determines classification of  financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition.
After initial recognition, no reclassification is made  for financial assets which are equity instruments  and financial liabilities.
For financial assets which  are debt instruments, a reclassification is made  only if there is a change in the business model  for managing those assets.
Changes to the  business model are expected to be infrequent.
The Company’s senior management determines  change in the business model as a result of external  or internal changes which are significant to the  Company’s operations.
Such changes are evident  to external parties.
A change in the business  model occurs when the Company either begins  or ceases to perform an activity that is significant  to its operations.
If Company reclassifies financial  assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively  from the reclassification date which is the first day  of the immediately next reporting period following  the change in business model.
The Company does  not restate any previously recognised gains, losses  (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.
The following table shows various reclassification and how they  are accounted for Original  classification  Revised  classification  Accounting treatment Amortised  cost  FVTPL Fair value is measured  at reclassification date.
Difference between previous  amortized cost and fair value  is recognised in P&L.
FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new gross  carrying amount.
EIR is  calculated based on the new  gross carrying amount.
Amortised  cost  FVTOCI Fair value is measured  at reclassification date.
Difference between previous  amortised cost and fair  value is recognised in OCI.
No change in EIR due to  reclassification.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new  amortised cost carrying  amount.
However,  cumulative gain or loss in  OCI is adjusted against fair  value.
Consequently, the  asset is measured as if it  had always been measured  at amortised cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new  carrying amount.
No other  adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be  measured at fair value.
Cumulative gain or loss  previously recognized in OCI  is reclassified to P&L at the  reclassification date.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 208 A Maharatna Company  2.14.5 Offsetting of financial instruments      Financial  assets and financial liabilities are offset  and the net amount is reported in the consolidated  balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable  legal right to offset the recognised amounts and  there is an intention to settle on a net basis,  to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously.
2.15.Borr owing Costs    Borro wing costs are expensed as and when incurred  except where they are directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of qualifying  assets i.e.
the assets that necessarily takes substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use, in which  case they are capitalised as part of the cost of those  asset up to the date when the qualifying asset is ready  for its intended use.
2.16Taxation     Income  tax expense represents the sum of the tax  currently payable and deferred tax.
Current  tax is the amount of income taxes payable  (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss)  for a period.
Taxable profit differs from “profit before  income tax” as reported in the statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income because it  excludes items of income or expense that are taxable  or deductible in other years and it further excludes  items that are never taxable or deductible.
The  company’s liability for current tax is calculated using  tax rates that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Def erred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all  taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets  are generally recognised for all deductible temporary  difference to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profits will be available against which those deductible  temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and  liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference  arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition  (other than in a business combination) of other assets  and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the  taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Def erred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable  temporary differences associated with investments  in subsidiaries and associates, except where the  company is able to control the reversal of the temporary  difference and it is probable that the temporary  difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary  differences associated with such investments and  interests are only recognised to the extent that it is  probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits  against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary  differences.
The  carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at the end of each reporting period and  reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all  or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised  deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each  reporting year and are recognised to the extent that it  has become probable that sufficient taxable profit will  be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset  to be recovered.
Def erred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  period in which the liability is settled or the asset is  realised,  based on tax rate (and tax laws) that have  been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the  reporting period.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets  reflects the tax consequences that would follow from  the manner in which the company expects, at the end  of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying  amount of its assets and liabilities.
Current  and deferred tax are recognised in profit  or loss, except when they relate to items that are  recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax  are also recognised in other comprehensive income  or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax  or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a  business combination, the tax effect is included in the  accounting for the business combination.
2.17Emplo yee Benefits  2.17.1  Shor t-term Benefits     All  short term employee benefits are recognized in  the period in which they are incurred.
2.17.2  P ost-employment benefits and other long term  employee benefits  2.17.2.1 Defined contrib utions plans     A  defined contribution plan is a post-employment  benefit plan for Provident fund and Pension under  which the company pays fixed contribution into  fund maintained by a separate statutory body  (Coal Mines Provident Fund) constituted under  an enactment of law and the company will have  no legal or constructive obligation to pay further  amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined  contribution plans are recognised as an employee  benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss  in the periods during which services are rendered  by employees.
2.17.2.2 Defined benefits plans     A  defined benefit plan is a post-employment  benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
Gratuity, leave encashment are defined benefit  plans (with ceilings on benefits).
The company’s  net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans  is calculated by estimating the amount of future  benefit that employees have earned in return of  their service in the current and prior periods.
The  benefit is discounted to determine its present  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 209 2016 - 2017 value and reduced by the fair value of plan assets,  if any.
The discount rate is based on the prevailing  market yields of Indian Government securities  as at the reporting date that have maturity  dates approximating the terms of the company’s  obligations and that are denominated in the same  currency in which the benefits are expected to be  paid.
The  application of actuarial valuation involves  making assumptions about discount rate, expected  rates of return on assets, future salary increases,  mortality rates etc.
Due to the long term nature  of these plans, such estimates are subject to  uncertainties.
The calculation is performed at each  balance sheet by an actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
When the calculation results in  to the benefit to the company, the recognised asset  is limited to the present value of the economic  benefits available in the form of any future refunds  from the plan or reduction in future contributions  to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the  company if it is realisable during the life of the plan,  or on settlement of plan liabilities.
Re-measurement  of the net defined benefit  liability, which comprise actuarial gain and  losses considering the return on plan assets  (excluding interest) and the effects of the assets  ceiling (if any, excluding interest) are recognised  immediately in the other comprehensive income.
The company determines the net interest expense  (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset)  for the period by applying the discount rate used  to measure the defined benefit obligation at  the beginning of the annual period to the then  net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into  account any changes in the net defined benefit  liability (asset) during the period as a result of  contributions and benefit payments.
Net interest  expense and other expenses related to defined  benefit plans are recognised in profit and loss.
When the benefits of the plan are improved, the  portion of the increased benefit relating to past  service by employees is recognised as expense  immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
2.17.3 Other Emplo yee benefits     Cer tain other employee benefits namely benefit  on account of LTA, LTC, Life Cover scheme,  Group personal Accident insurance scheme,  settlement allowance, post-retirement medical  benefit scheme and compensation to dependents  of deceased in mine accidents etc., are also  recognised on the same basis as described above  for defined benefits plan.
These benefits do not  have specific funding.
2.18Foreign Currenc y    The  company’s reported currency and the functional  currency for majority of its operations is in Indian  Rupees (INR) being the principal currency of the  economic environment in which it operates.
T ransactions in foreign currencies are converted  into the reported currency of the company using  the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction  date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies outstanding at the end of the  reporting period are translated at the exchange rates  prevailing as at the end of reporting period.
Exchange  differences arising on the settlement of monetary  assets and liabilities or on translating monetary assets  and liabilities at rates different from those at which they  were translated on initial recognition during the period  or in previous financial statements are recognised in  statement of profit and loss in the period in which they  arise.
Non-monetar y items denominated in foreign currency  are valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the  date of transactions.
2.19Stripping Activity Expense/Adjustment    In  case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials  (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on  the top of coal seam is required to be removed to  get access to the coal and its extraction.
This waste  removal activity is known as ‘Stripping’.In opencast  mines, the company has to incur such expenses over  the life of the mine (as technically estimated).
Theref ore, as a policy, in the mines with rated capacity  of one million tonnes per annum and above, cost  of Stripping is charged on technically evaluated  average stripping ratio (OB:COAL) at each mine  with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and  ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to  revenue.
Net  of balances of stripping activity asset and ratio  variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as  Stripping Activity Adjustment under the head Non -  Current Assets/ Non-Current Provisions as the case  may be.
The  reported quantity of overburden as per record is  considered in calculating the ratio for OBR accounting  where the variance between reported quantity and  measured quantity is within the lower of the two  alternative permissible limits, as detailed hereunder:- Annual Quantum of OBR  of the Mine Permissible limits of variance I II % Quantum  (in Mill.
Cu.
Mtr.)
Less than 1 Mill.
CUM +/- 5% 0.03 Between 1 and 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 3% 0.20 More than 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 2%    Ho wever, where the variance is beyond the permissible  limits as above, the measured quantity is considered.
In  case of mines with rated capacity of less than one  million tonne, the above policy is not applied and actual  cost of stripping activity incurred during the year is  recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 210 A Maharatna Company  2.20Inventories  2.20.1  Stoc k of Coal     In ventories of coal/coke are stated at lower of cost  and net realisable value.
Cost of inventories are  calculated using the First in First out method.
Net  realisable value represents the estimated selling  price of inventories less all estimated costs of  completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Book  stock of coal is considered in the accounts  where the variance between book stock and  measured stock is upto +/- 5% and in cases where  the variance is beyond +/- 5% the measured  stock is considered.
Such stock are valued at net  realisable value or cost whichever is lower.
Coke is  considered as a part of stock of coal.
Coal  & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or  net realisable value and considered as a part of  stock of coal.
Slurr y (coking/semi-coking), middling of washeries  and by products are valued at net realisable value  and considered as a part of stock of coal.
2.20.2  Stores & Spares     The  Stock of stores & spare parts (which also  includes loose tools) at central & area stores are  considered as per balances appearing in priced  stores ledger and are valued at cost calculated  on the basis of weighted average method.
The  inventory of stores & spare parts lying at collieries /  sub-stores / drilling camps/ consuming centres are  considered at the year end only as per physically  verified stores and are valued at cost.
Pro visions are made at the rate of 100% for  unserviceable, damaged and obsolete stores and  spares and at the rate of 50% for stores & spares  not moved for 5 years.
2.20.3  Other In ventories     W orkshop jobs including work-in-progress are  valued at cost.
Stock of press jobs (including work  in progress) and stationary at printing press and  medicines at central hospital are valued at cost.
Ho wever, Stock of stationery (other than lying at  printing press), bricks, sand, medicine (except at  Central Hospitals), aircraft spares and scraps are  not considered in inventory considering their value  not being significant.
2.21Pr ovisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent  Assets     Pro visions are recognized when the company has a  present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result  of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow  of economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of  the obligation can be made.
Where the time value  of money is material, provisions are stated at the  present value of the expenditure expected to settle the  obligation.
All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date  and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be  estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a  contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow  of economic benefits is remote.
Possible obligations,  whose existence will only be confirmed by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future  uncertain events not wholly within the control of the  company, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities  unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is  remote.
Contingent  Assets are not recognised in the financial  statements.
However, when the realisation of income is  virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent  asset and its recognition is appropriate.
2.22Earnings per share    Basic  earnings per share are computed by dividing the  net profit after tax by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted  earnings per shares is computed by dividing the  profit after tax by the weighted average number of  equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings  per shares and also the weighted average number  of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.23J udgements, Estimates and Assumptions     The  preparation of the financial statements in  conformity with Ind AS requires management to make  estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect  the application of accounting policies and the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of  financial statements and the amount of revenue and  expenses during the reported period.
Application of  accounting policies involving complex and subjective  judgements and the use of assumptions in these  financial statements have been disclosed.
Accounting  estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing  basis.
Revisions to accounting estimate are recognised  in the period in which the estimates are revised and, if  material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  financial statements.
2.23.1 J udgements    In the process of applying the Company’s accounting  policies, management has made the following  judgements, which have the most significant effect on  the amounts recognised in the financial statements:  2.23.1.1 Form ulation of Accounting Policies     Accounting  policies are formulated in a manner  that result in financial statements containing  relevant and reliable information about the  transactions, other events and conditions to which  they apply.
Those policies need not be applied  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 211 2016 - 2017 when the effect of applying them is immaterial.
In  the absence of an Ind AS that specifically  applies to a transaction, other event or condition,  management has used its judgement in developing  and applying an accounting policy that results in  information that is:    a)  rele vant to the economic decision-making needs  of users and     b)  reliab le in that financial statements:     (i)  represent  faithfully the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company; (ii)  reflect the economic substance of transactions,  other events and conditions, and not merely the  legal form; (iii) are neutral, i.e.
free from bias; (iv)  are prudent; and (v) are complete in all material  respects on a consistent basis     In  making the judgement management refers to,  and considers the applicability of, the following  sources in descending order:    (a)  the  requirements in Ind ASs dealing with similar  and related issues; and    (b)  the  definitions, recognition criteria and  measurement concepts for assets, liabilities,  income and expenses in the Framework.
In  making the judgement, management considers  the most recent pronouncements of International  Accounting Standards Board and in absence  thereof those of the other standard-setting bodies  that use a similar conceptual framework to develop  accounting standards, other accounting literature  and accepted industry practices, to the extent that  these do not conflict with the sources in above  paragraph.
The  Company operates in the mining sector (a sector  where the exploration, evaluation, development  production phases are based on the varied  topographical and geomining terrain spread over  the lease period running over decades and prone to   constant changes), the accounting policies  whereof have evolved based on specific industry  practices supported by research committees  and approved by the various regulators owing  to its consistent application over the last several  decades.
In the absence of specific accounting  literature, guidance and standards in certain  specific areas which are in the process of evolution.
The Company continues to strive to develop   accounting policies in line with the development of  accounting literature and any development therein  shall be accounted for prospectively as per the  procedure laid down above more particularly in  Ind AS 8.
The  financial statements are prepared on going  concern basis using accrual basis of accounting.
2.23.1.2 Materiality     Ind  AS applies to items which are material.
Management uses judgement in deciding whether  individual items or groups of item are material  in the financial statements.
Materiality is judged  by reference to the size and nature of the item.
The deciding factor is whether omission or  misstatement could individually or collectively  influence the economic decisions that users  make on the basis of the financial statements.
Management also uses judgement of materiality  for determining the compliance requirement of  the Ind AS.
In particular circumstances either the  nature or the amount of an item or aggregate of  items could be the determining factor.
Further  the Company may also be required to present  separately immaterial items when required by law.
2.23.1.3 Operating lease     Compan y has entered into lease agreements.
The  Company has determined, based on an evaluation  of the terms and conditions of the arrangements,  such as the lease term not constituting a major part  of the economic life of the commercial property  and the fair value of the asset, that it retains all  the significant risks and rewards of ownership of  these properties and accounts for the contracts as  operating leases.
2.23.2 Estimates and assumptions      The  key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at  the reporting date, that have a significant risk of  causing a material adjustment to the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities within the  next financial year, are described below.
The  Company based its assumptions and estimates  on parameters available when the consolidated  financial statements were prepared.
Existing  circumstances and assumptions about future  developments, however, may change due to  market changes or circumstances arising that are  beyond the control of the Company.
Such changes  are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
2.23.2.1 Impairment of non-financial assets     There  is an indication of impairment if, the carrying  value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher of  its fair value less costs of disposal and its value  in use.
Company considers individual mines as  separate cash generating units for the purpose of   test of impairment.
The value in use  calculation is based on a DCF model.
The  cash flows are derived from the budget for   the next five years and do not include restructuring  activities that the Company is not yet committed  to or significant future investments that will  enhance the asset’s performance of the   CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount  is sensitive to the discount rate used for  the DCF model as well as the expected   future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for  extrapolation purposes.
These estimates are most  relevant to other mining infrastructures.
The key  COAL INDIA LIMITED 212 A Maharatna Company assumptions used to determine the recoverable  amount for the different CGUs, are disclosed and  further explained in respective notes.
2.23.2.2 T axes      Def erred tax assets are recognised for unused  tax losses to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available against  which the losses can be utilised.
Significant  management judgement is required to determine  the amount of deferred tax assets that can  be recognised, based upon the likely timing   and the level of future taxable profits together with  future tax planning strategies.
2.23.2.3 Defined benefit plans      The  cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and  other post-employment medical benefits and  the present value of the gratuity obligation are  determined using actuarial valuations.
An actuarial  valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in the  future.
These include the determination of the  discount rate, future salary increases and mortality  rates.
Due  to the complexities involved in the valuation  and its long-term nature, a defined benefit  obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date.
The parameter most subject  to change is the discount rate.
In determining the  appropriate discount rate for plans operated in  India, the management considers the interest rates  of government bonds in currencies consistent with  the currencies of the post-employment benefit  obligation.
The  mortality rate is based on publicly available  mortality tables of the country.
Those mortality  tables tend to change only at interval in response  to demographic changes.
Future salary increases  and gratuity increases are based on expected  future inflation rate.
2.23.2.4F air value measurement of financial  instruments      When  the fair values of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active  markets, their fair value is measured using generally  accepted valuation techniques including the   DCF model.
The inputs to these models are taken from   observable markets where possible, but where  this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is  required in establishing fair values.
Judgements  include considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk, volatility and other relevant input  /considerations.
Changes in assumptions and  estimates about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of financial instruments.
2.23.2.5Intangib le asset under development     The  Company capitalises intangible asset under  development for a project in accordance with  the accounting policy.
Initial capitalisation of  costs is based on management’s judgement  that technological and economic feasibility is  confirmed, usually when a project report is  formulated and approved.
2.23.2.6 Pr ovision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration  and Decommissioning Obligation     In  determining the fair value of the provision for Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made  in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of  site restoration and dismantling and the expected  timing of those costs.
The Company estimates  provision using the DCF method considering life  of the project/mine based on    •  Estimated  cost per hectare as specified in  guidelines issued by ministry of Coal, Government  of India    •  The  discount rate (pre tax rate) that reflect current  market assessments of the time value of money  and the risks specific to the liability.

Mine Closure expenditure is provided as per approved Mine   Closure Plan.
The estimates of expenses are escalated for inflation, and then discounted at a discount rate (@8%) that reflects   current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of  the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The value of the provision is progressively increased over time as  the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an expense recognised as financial expenses.

(Refer Note 9 for deposit with banks under Mine Closure Plan)  No  mining activity has been undertaken in Lekhapani and Tikak Extension mines as stage II forest clearance approval is pending.

Fir st time adoption of Ind AS These financial statements of the Company, for the year ended  31st March 2017, are the first financial statements prepared  in accordance with Ind AS.
For periods up to and including the  year ended 31st March 2016, the Company prepared its financial  statements in accordance with accounting standards notified  under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with  paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (erstwhile  - Indian GAAP).
Accordingly, the Company has prepared financial  statements which comply with Ind AS applicable for periods  ending on 31st March 2017, together with the comparative period  data as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016, as described in  the summary of significant accounting policies.
In preparing these  financial statements, the Company’s opening balance sheet was  prepared as at 1st April 2015, the Company’s date of transition  to Ind AS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by  the Company in restating its Indian GAAP financial statements,  including the balance sheet as at 1st April 2015 and the financial  statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016.
Exemptions applied Ind AS 101 allows first-time adopters  certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain  requirements under Ind AS.
The Company has applied the  following exemptions:  (i)  F air value measurement of financial assets or finan cial  liabilities (Ind AS 101.D20)  First-time  adopters may apply Ind AS 109 to day one gain  or loss provisions prospectively to transactions occurring on  or after the date of transition to Ind AS.
Therefore, unless a  first-time adopter elects to apply Ind AS 109 retrospectively to  day one gain or loss transactions, transactions that occurred  prior to the date of transition to Ind AS do not need to be  retrospectively restated.
As  a first time adopter of Ind AS, the Company has opted to  apply Ind AS 109 prospectively.
(ii)  Mine Closure , Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation in Property, Plant and Equipment (Ind AS  101.D21)  Appendix  ‘A’ to Ind AS 16 Changes in Existing  Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities requires  specified changes in a decommissioning, restoration or similar  liability to be added to or deducted from the cost of the asset to  which it relates; the adjusted depreciable amount of the asset  is then depreciated prospectively over its remaining useful life.
A first-time adopter need not comply with these requirements  for changes in such liabilities that occurred before the date of  transition to Ind AS.
In other words, a first-time adopter will not  need to estimate what provision would have been calculated at  earlier reporting dates.
Instead, the decommissioning liability  is calculated at the date of transition and it is assumed that  the same liability (adjusted only for the time value of money)  existed when the asset was first acquired/constructed.
As  a first time adopter of Ind AS, the Company has calculated  the Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation at the date of transition assuming that the same  liability (present value) existed when the asset was first  acquired/constructed.
Reconciliation of Equity as prepared under Indian GAAP  with equity restated under Ind AS is summarised belo w: (` in Crore) Sl.

(b)  F air value hierarchy  The  Company uses the judgments and estimates in  determining the fair values of the financial instruments that  are recognised and measured at fair value.
To provide an  indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining  fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments  into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard.
An explanation of each level is given below:  Le vel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments  measured using quoted prices.
This includes mutual funds that  have quoted price and are valued using the closing NAV .
Le vel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded  in an active market is determined using valuation techniques  which maximize the use of observable market data and rely  as little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant  inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the  instrument is included in level 2.
Le vel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based  on observable market data, the instrument is included in level  3.
This is the case for unlisted equity securities, preference  shares borrowings, security deposits and other liabilities taken  included in level 3.
Mutual  Fund Investments are classified as FVTPL have been  valued as per Level I of Fair Value Hierarchy.
(c)  V aluation technique used in determining fair value  V aluation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the use of quoted market prices of instruments.
(d)  F air value measurements using significant unobservable  inputs  At  present there are no fair value measurements using  significant unobservable inputs.
(e)  F air values of financial assets and liabilities measured at  amortised cost  •  The  carrying amounts of trade receivables, short term  deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables are  considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their  short-term nature.
•  The Company considers that the Security Deposits  does not include a significant financing component.
The  milestone payments (security deposits) coincide with  the company’s performance and the contract requires  amounts to be retained for reasons other than the provision  COAL INDIA LIMITED 242 A Maharatna Company of finance.
The withholding of a specified percentage of  each milestone payment is intended to protect the interest  of the company, from the contractor failing to adequately  complete its obligations under the contract.
Accordingly  transaction cost of Security deposit is considered as fair  value at initial recognition and subsequently measured at  amortised cost.
Significant estimates:  The fair value of financial  instruments that are not traded in an active market is  determined using valuation techniques.
The Company  uses its judgment to select a method and makes suitable  assumptions at the end of each reporting period.

A.
Credit  Risk: Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,  investments carried at amortised cost and deposits with banks  and financial institutions, as well as including outstanding  receivables.
Credit risk mana gement:  Receiv ables arise mainly out of sale of Coal.
Sale of Coal is  broadly categorized as sale through fuel supply agreements  (FSAs) and e-auction.

E-A uction Scheme  The  E-Auction scheme of coal has been introduced to  provide access to coal for customers who were not able  to source their coal requirement through the available  institutional mechanisms under the NCDP for various  reasons, for example, due to a less than full allocation of  their normative requirement under NCDP , seasonality of  their coal requirement and limited requirement of coal that  does not warrant a long-term linkage.
The quantity of coal to  be offered under E-Auction is reviewed from time to time by  the Ministry of Coal.

Note 2:  SIGNIFICANT A CCOUNTING POLICIES  2.1  Basis of preparation of financial statements    The  financial statements of the Company (CIL Consolidated)  have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31st  March 2016, the CIL Consolidated (hereinafter referred as  “Company”) prepared its financial statements in accordance  with Accounting Standards (AS) notified under section 133  of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7  of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and in accordance  with companies (Accounting Standards), Rules 2006.
These  financial statements for the year ended 31st March 2017  are the first financial statements of the Company prepared  in accordance with Ind AS.
Refer to Note no.
38.6 for  information on first time adoption of Ind AS.
The financial statements have been prepared on historical  cost basis of measurement, except for   l certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value  (refer accounting policy on financial instruments in para 2.15);  l Defined benefit plans- plan assets measured at f air value;   l In ventories at Cost or NRV whichever is lower (refer  accounting policy in para no.
2.21).
2.1.1  Rounding of amounts  Amounts  in these financial statements have, unless  otherwise indicated, have been rounded off to ‘rupees  in crore’ up to two decimal points.
2.2  Basis of consolidation  2.2.1  Subsidiar ies  Subsidiar ies are all entities over which the Company  has control.
The Company controls an entity when  the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable  returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to affect those returns through its power to  direct the relevant activities of the entity.
Subsidiaries  are fully consolidated from the date on which control is  transferred to the Company.
They are deconsolidated  from the date when control ceases.
The  acquisition method of accounting is used to  account for business combinations by the Company.
The  Company combines the financial statements of the  parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together  like items of assets, liabilities, equity, cash flows,  income and expenses.
Intercompany transactions,  balances and unrealised gains on transactions  between group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised  losses between group companies are also eliminated  unless the transaction provides evidence of an  impairment of the transferred asset.
All the companies  within the CIL Consolidated normally uses accounting  policies as adopted by the CIL Consolidated for like  transactions and events in similar circumstances.
In  case of significant deviations of a particular constituent  company within CIL Consolidated, appropriate  adjustments are made to the financial statement of  such constituent company to ensure conformity with  the CIL Consolidated accounting policies.
Non-controlling  interests in the results and equity of  subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of  changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.
2.2.2  Associates  Associates  are all entities over which the Company  has significant influence but no control or joint control.
This is generally the case where the Company holds  between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
In vestments in associates are accounted for using  the equity method of accounting, after initially being  recognised at cost, except when the investment, or  a portion thereof, classified as held for sale, in which  case it is accounted in accordance with Ind AS 105.
The  Company impairs its net investment in the  associates on the basis of objective evidence.
2.2.3  Joint arr angements   Joint  arrangements are those arrangements where the  Company is having joint control with one or more other  parties.
Joint  control is the contractually agreed sharing of  control of the arrangement which exist only when  decisions about the relevant activities require the  unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint Arrangements are classified as either joint  operations or joint ventures.
The classification depends  on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor,  rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 262 A Maharatna Company 2.2.4 Joint Oper ations  Joint  operations are those joint arrangements  whereby the Company is having rights to the assets  and obligations for the liabilities relating to the  arrangements.
Compan y recognises its direct right to the assets,  liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations  and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets,  liabilities, revenues and expenses.
These have been  incorporated in the financial statements under the  appropriate headings.
2.2.5  Joint v entures  Joint  ventures are those joint arrangements whereby  the Company is having rights to the net assets of the  arrangements.
Interests  in joint ventures are accounted for using the  equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in  the consolidated balance sheet.
In vestments in Joint venture are accounted for   using the equity method of accounting, after initially  being recognized at cost, except when the investment,  or a portion thereof, s classified as held for sale, in  which case it is accounted in accordance with Ind   AS 105.
The  Company impairs its net investment in the joint  venture on the basis of objective evidence.
2.2.6  Equity method  Under  the equity method of accounting, the investments  are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter  to recognise the Company’s share of the post- acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and  loss, and the Company’s share of other comprehensive  income of the investee in other comprehensive income.
Dividends received or receivable from associates and  joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the  carrying amount of the investment.
When  the Company’s share of losses in an equity- accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest  in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term  receivables, the Company does not recognise further  losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made  payments on behalf of the other entity.
Unrealised  gains on transactions between the Company  and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to  the extent of the Company’s interest in these entities.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the  transaction provides evidence of an impairment of  the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of equity  accounted investees have been changed where  necessary to ensure consistency with the policies  adopted by the Company.
2.2.7  Changes in o wnership interests  The  Company treats transactions with non-controlling  interests that do not result in a loss of control as  transactions with equity owners of the Company.
A  change in ownership interest results in an adjustment  between the carrying amounts of the controlling and  non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests  in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount of  the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any fair  value of consideration paid or received is recognised  within equity  When  the Company ceases to consolidate or equity  account for an investment because of a loss of control,  joint control or significant influence, any retained  interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with  the change in carrying amount recognised in profit  or loss.
This fair value becomes the initial carrying  amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting  for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture  or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously  recognised in other comprehensive income in respect  of that entity are accounted for as if the Company had  directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
This  may mean that amounts previously recognised in other  comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
If  the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate  is reduced but joint control or significant influence is  retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts  previously recognised in other comprehensive income  are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
2.3  Current and non-current Classification     The  Company presents assets and liabilities in the Balance  Sheet based on current/ non-current classification.
An  asset is treated as current by the Company when:   (a)  it  expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume  it, in its normal operating cycle;   (b)  it holds the asset pr imarily for the purpose of trading;   (c)  it  expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the  reporting period; or   (d)  the  asset is cash or a cash equivalent (as defined in Ind  AS 7) unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged  or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non- current.
A liability is treated as current b y the Company when:   (a)  it  expects to settle the liability in its normal operating cycle;   (b)  it holds the liability pr imarily for the purpose of trading;   (c)  the  liability is due to be settled within twelve months after  the reporting period; or   (d)  it  does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting  period.
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the  counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity  instruments do not affect its classification.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
2.4  Re venue recognition 2.4.1  Re venue from sale of goods  Re venue from the sale of goods is recognised when all  the following conditions have been satisfied:  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 263 2016 - 2017 (a) the Company has transferred to the buyer the  significant risks and rewards of ownership of the  goods; (b)  the  Company retains neither continuing managerial  involvement to the degree usually associated with  ownership nor effective control over the goods  sold; (c)  the amount of re venue can be measured reliably; (d)  it  is probable that the economic benefits associated  with the transaction will flow to the Company; and (e)  the  costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of  the transaction can be measured reliably.
Re venue is measured at the fair value of the  consideration received or receivable, taking into  account contractually defined terms of payment and  excluding taxes, levies or duties collected on behalf of  the government/ other statutory bodies.
Adv ances received from the customers are reported  as customer’s deposits unless the above conditions for  revenue recognition are met.
Ho wever, based on the educational material on Ind AS  18 issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India, the Company has assumed that recovery  of excise duty flows to the Company on its own  account.
This is for the reason that it is a liability of the  manufacturer which forms part of the cost of production,  irrespective of whether the goods are sold or not.
Since  the recovery of excise duty flows to the Company on its  own account, gross revenue includes excise duty.
Ho wever, other taxes, levies or duties are not  considered to be received by the Company on its own  account and are excluded from net revenue.
2.4.2  Interest  Interest  income is recognised using the Effective  Interest Method.
2.4.3  Dividend  Dividend  income from investments is recognised when  the rights to receive payment is established.
2.4.4  Other Claims  Other  claims (including interest on delayed realization  from customers) are accounted for, when there is  certainty of realisation and can be measured reliably.
2.4.5  Render ing of Services  When  the outcome of a transaction involving the  rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue  associated with the transaction is recognised with  reference to the stage of completion of the transaction  at the end of the reporting period.
The outcome of a  transaction can be estimated reliably when all the  following conditions are satisfied:  (a)  the amount of re venue can be measured reliably; (b)  it  is probable that the economic benefits associated  with the transaction will flow to the Company; (c)  the stage of completion of the transaction at the  end of the reporting period can be measured  reliably; and (d)  the  costs incurred for the transaction and the costs  to complete the transaction can be measured  reliably.
2.5  Grants fr om Government    Go vernment Grants are not recognised until there is  reasonable assurance that the company will comply with  the conditions attached to them and that there is reasonable  certainty that grants will be received.
Go vernment grants are recognised in Statement of Profit  & Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which  the company recognises as expenses the related costs for  which the grants are intended to compensate.
Go vernment Grants related to assets are presented in the  balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income  and are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on  systematic basis over the useful life of asset.
Gr ants related to income (i.e.
grant related to other than  assets) are presented as part of statement of profit and  loss under the head ‘Other Income’.
A  government grant/assistance that becomes receivable  as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred  or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to  the Company with no future related costs, is recognised in  profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable.
The Government grants or grants in the nature of promoter’s  contribution should be recognised directly in “Capital  Reserve” which forms part of the “Shareholders fund”.
2.6  Leases    A  finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the  risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
Title  may or may not eventually be transferred.
An oper ating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
2.6.1  Compan y as a lessee     A  lease is classified at the inception date as a finance  lease or an operating lease.
2.6.1.1  Finance  leases are capitalised at the commencement  of the lease at the inception date fair value of the  leased property or, if lower, at the present value of  the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are  apportioned between finance charges and reduction of  the lease liability so as to achieve a constant periodic  rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance  charges are recognised in finance costs in the  statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly  attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are  capitalized in accordance with the Company’s general  policy on the borrowing costs.
A  leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the  asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that  the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the  lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of  the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 264 A Maharatna Company  2.6.1.2  Operating lease -  Lease payments under an operating  lease is recognised as an expense on a straight-line  basis over the lease term unless either:     (a)  another  systematic basis is more representative of the  time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the payments  to the lessors are not on that basis; or     (b)  the  payments to the lessor are structured to increase  in line with expected general inflation to compensate  for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If  payments to the lessor vary because of factors other  than general inflation, then this condition is not met.
2.6.2  Compan y as a lessor      Oper ating leases Lease income from operating leases  (excluding amounts for services such as insurance and  maintenance) is recognised in income on a straight- line basis over the lease term, unless either:     (a)  another systematic basis is more representative of  the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the  leased asset is diminished, even if the payments to the  lessors are not on that basis; or     (b)  the payments to the lessor are structured to increase  in line with expected general inflation to compensate  for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
If  payments to the lessor vary according to factors other  than inflation, then this condition is not met.
Initial  direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging  an operating lease are added to the carrying amount  of the leased asset and recognised as an expense  over the initial lease term on the same basis as lease  income.
Finance  leases Amounts due from lessees under  finance leases are recorded as receivables at the  Company’s net investment in the leases.
Finance  lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as  to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net  investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
2.7  Non-current assets held f or sale     The  Company classifies non-current assets and (or disposal  groups) as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be  recovered principally through a sale rather than through  continuing use.
Actions required to complete the sale  should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes  to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be  withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the sale  expected within one year from the date of classification.
F or these purposes, sale transactions include exchanges  of non-current assets for other non-current assets when the  exchange has commercial substance.
The criteria for held  for sale classification is regarded met only when the assets  or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its  present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and  customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups),  its sale is highly probable; and it will genuinely be sold,  not abandoned.
The Company treats sale of the asset or  disposal group to be highly probable when:    l The appropriate level of management is committed to a  plan to sell the asset (or disposal group),    l An active programme to locate a buyer and complete  the plan has been initiated    l The asset (or disposal group) is being actively marketed  for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its  current fair value,    l The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as  a completed sale within one year from the date of  classification, and    l Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it  is unlikely those significant changes to the plan will be  made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
2.8  Pr operty, Plant and Equipment (PPE)    Land  is carried at historical cost.
Historical cost includes  expenditure which are directly attributable to the acquisition  of the land like, rehabilitation expenses, resettlement cost  and compensation in lieu of employment incurred for  concerned displaced persons etc.
After  recognition, an item of all other Property, plant and  equipment are carried at its cost less any accumulated  depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses  under Cost Model.
The cost of an item of property, plant  and equipment comprises:    (a)  its  purchase price, including import duties and non- refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade  discounts and rebates.
(b)  an y costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to  the location and condition necessary for it to be capable  of operating in the manner intended by management.
(c)  the  initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and  removing the item and restoring the site on which it is  located, the obligation for which the Company incurs  either when the item is acquired or as a consequence  of having used the item during a particular period for  purposes other than to produce inventories during that  period.
Each  part of an item of property, plant and equipment  with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost  of the item depreciated separately.
However, significant  part(s) of an item of PPE having same useful life and  depreciation method are grouped together in determining  the depreciation charge.
Costs  of the day to-day servicing described as for the  ‘repairs and maintenance’ are recognised in the statement  of profit and loss in the period in which the same are  incurred.
Subsequent  cost of replacing parts significant in relation to  the total cost of an item of property, plant and equipment   are recognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is   probable that future economic benefits associated with the  item will flow to the Company; and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of those parts  that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with the  derecognition policy mentioned below.
When  major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 265 2016 - 2017 in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and  equipment as a replacement if it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with the item will flow to  the Company; and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably.
Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the  previous inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is  derecognised.
An  item of Property, plant or equipment is derecognised  upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected from the continued use of assets.
Any gain or loss  arising on such derecognition of an item of property plant  and equipment is recognised in profit and Loss.
Depreciation  on property, plant and equipment, except  freehold land, is provided as per cost model on straight line  basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows: Other Land   (incl.
Leasehold Land) : Life of the project or lease  term whichever is lower  Building : 3-60 years Roads : 3-10 years  Telecommunication : 3-9 years Railway Sidings : 15 years Plant and Equipment : 5-15 years Computers and Laptops : 3 Y ears  Office equipment: 3-6 years Furniture and Fixtures : 10 years Vehicles: 8-10 years    Based  on technical evaluation, the management believes  that the useful lives given above best represents the period  over which the management expects to use the asset.
Hence the useful lives of the assets may be different from  useful lives as prescribed under Part C of schedule II of  companies act, 2013.
The  estimated useful life of the assets is reviewed at the  end of each financial year.
The  residual value of Property, plant and equipment is  considered as 5% of the original cost of the asset except  some items of assets such as, Coal tub, winding ropes,  haulage ropes, stowing pipes & safety lamps etc.
for which  the technically estimated useful life has been determined to  be one year with nil residual value.
Depreciation  on the assets added / disposed of during the  year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the  month of addition / disposal.
V alue of “Other Land” includes land acquired under Coal  Bearing Area (Acquisition & Development) (CBA) Act, 1957,  Land Acquisition Act, 1894, Right to Fair Compensation  and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and  Resettlement (RFCTLAAR) Act, 2013, Long term transfer  of government land etc., which is amortised on the basis  of the balance life of the project; and in case of Leasehold  land such amortisation is based on lease period or balance  life of the project whichever is lower.
Fully  depreciated assets, retired from active use are  disclosed separately as surveyed off assets at its residual  value under Property, plant Equipment and are tested for  impairment.
Capital  Expenses incurred by the company on construction/ development of certain assets which are essential for  production, supply of goods or for the access to any  existing Assets of the company are recognised as Enabling  Assets under Property, Plant and Equipment.
T ransition to Ind AS    The  company elected to continue with the carrying value as  per cost model for all of its property, plant and equipment  as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of  transition to Ind ASs, measured as per the previous GAAP .
2.9  Mine Closure , Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation    The  company’s obligation for land reclamation and  decommissioning of structures consists of spending at  both surface and underground mines in accordance with  the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India.
The company estimates its obligation for Mine Closure, Site  Restoration and Decommissioning based upon detailed  calculation and technical assessment of the amount  and timing of the future cash spending to perform the  required work.
Mine Closure expenditure is provided as per  approved Mine Closure Plan.
The estimates of expenses  are escalated for inflation, and then discounted at a  discount rate that reflects current market assessment of  the time value of money and the risks, such that the amount  of provision reflects the present value of the expenditures  expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The  company records a corresponding asset associated with  the liability for final reclamation and mine closure.
The  obligation and corresponding assets are recognised in  the period in which the liability is incurred.
The asset  representing the total site restoration cost (as estimated by  Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited) as per  mine closure plan is recognised as a separate item in PPE  and amortised over the balance project/mine life.
The  value of the provision is progressively increased over  time as the effect of discounting unwinds; creating an  expense recognised as financial expenses.
Fur ther, a specific escrow fund account is maintained for  this purpose as per the approved mine closure plan.
The  progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to  year basis forming part of the total mine closure obligation  is initially recognised as receivable from escrow account  and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in  which the amount is withdrawn after the concurrence of the  certifying agency.
2.10  Exploration and Ev aluation Assets    Explor ation and evaluation assets comprise capitalised  costs which are attributable to the search for coal and  related resources, pending the determination of technical  feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an  identified resource which comprises inter alia the following:  •  researching and analysing histor ical exploration data;  •  gather ing exploration data through topographical, geo  COAL INDIA LIMITED 266 A Maharatna Company chemical and geo physical studies;  •  e xploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;  •  deter mining and examining the volume and grade of the  resource;  •  sur veying transportation and infrastructure requirements;  •  Conducting mar ket and finance studies.
The  above includes employee remuneration, cost of  materials and fuel used, payments to contractors etc.
As  the intangible component represents an insignificant/ indistinguishable portion of the overall expected tangible  costs to be incurred and recouped from future exploitation,  these costs along with other capitalised exploration costs  are recorded as exploration and evaluation asset.
Explor ation and evaluation costs are capitalised on a  project by project basis pending determination of technical  feasibility and commercial viability of the project and  disclosed as a separate line item under non-current assets.
They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated  impairment/provision.
Once  proved reserves are determined and development  of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation  assets are transferred to “Development” under capital work  in progress.
However, if proved reserves are not determined,  the exploration and evaluation asset is derecognised.
2.11De velopment Expenditure    When  proved reserves are determined and development  of mines/project is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and  evaluation cost is recognised as assets under construction  and disclosed as a component of capital work in progress  under the head “Development”.
All subsequent development  expenditure is also capitalised.
The development  expenditure capitalised is net of proceeds from the sale of  coal extracted during the development phase.
Commercial Operation    The  project/mines are brought to revenue; when  commercial readiness of a project/mine to yield production  on a sustainable basis is established either on the basis of  conditions specifically stated in the project report or on the  basis of the following criteria:    (a)  F rom beginning of the financial year immediately after  the year in which the project achieves physical output  of 25% of rated capacity as per approved project  report, or    (b)  2 y ears of touching of coal, or    (c)  F rom the beginning of the financial year in which the  value of production is more than total, expenses.
Whiche ver event occurs first;    On  being brought to revenue, the assets under capital work  in progress are reclassified as a component of property,  plant and equipment under the nomenclature “Other Mining  Infrastructure”.
Other Mining Infrastructure are amortised  from the year when the mine is brought under revenue in  20 years or working life of the project whichever is less.
2.12  Intangib le Assets    Intangib le assets acquired separately are measured on  initial recognition at cost.
The cost of intangible assets  acquired in a business combination is their fair value  at the date of acquisition.
Following initial recognition,  intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation (calculated on a straight-line basis over their  useful lives) and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Inter nally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not capitalised.
Instead, the related  expenditure is recognised in the statement of profit and loss  and other comprehensive income in the period in which the  expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets  are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets  with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic  lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an  indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The  amortisation period and the amortisation method for an  intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at  least at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in the  expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption  of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are  considered to modify the amortisation period or method,  as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting  estimates.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets  with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and  loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not  amortised but is tested for impairment at each reporting date.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible  asset are measured as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset  and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss    Explor ation and Evaluation assets attributable to blocks  identified for sale or proposed to be sold to outside  agencies (i.e.
for blocks not earmarked for CIL) are however,  classified as Intangible Assets and tested for impairment.
Cost  of Software recognized as intangible asset, is  amortised on straight line method over a period of legal  right to use or three years, whichever is less; with a nil  residual value.
2.13Impairment of Assets (other than financial assets)    The  Company assesses at the end of each reporting  period whether there is any indication that an asset may  be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
An asset’s  recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s or cash- generating unit’s value in use and its fair value less costs of  disposal, and is determined for an individual asset, unless  the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely  independent of those from other assets or groups of assets,  in which case the recoverable amount is determined for the  cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Company  considers individual mines as separate cash generating  units for the purpose of test of impairment.
If  the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount,the carrying amount of the asset is  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 267 2016 - 2017 reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.14In vestment Property  Proper ty (land or a building or part of a building or both) held to  earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than  for, use in the production or supply of goods or services or  for administrative purposes; or sale in the ordinary course  of businesses are classified as investment property.
In vestment property is measured initially at its cost,  including related transaction costs and where applicable  borrowing costs.
In vestment properties are depreciated using the straight- line method over their estimated useful lives.
2.15Financial Instruments    A  financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a  financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity  instrument of another entity.
2.15.1  Financial assets  2.15.1  Initial recognition and measurement   All financial assets are recognised initially at f air value,  in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value  through profit or loss, plus transaction costs that are  attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require  delivery of assets within a time frame established by  regulation or convention in the market place (regular  way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the  date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the  asset.
2.15.2  Subsequent measurement   F or purposes of subsequent measurement, financial  assets are classified in four categories:  •  Debt instr uments at amortised cost •  Debt  instruments at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVTOCI)  •  Debt  instruments, derivatives and equity  instruments at fair value through profit or loss  (FVTPL)  •  Equity  instruments measured at fair value through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)  2.15.2.1  Debt instr uments at amortised cost   A  ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met:  a)  The  asset is held within a business model whose  objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual  cash flows, and  b)  Contr actual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal amount outstanding.
After  initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account  any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or  costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
The EIR  amortisation is included in finance income in the  profit or loss.
The losses arising from impairment  are recognised in the profit or loss.
2.15.2.2  Debt instr ument at FVTOCI   A  ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met:  a)  The  objective of the business model is achieved  both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets, and      b)  The  asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.
Debt  instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value.
Fair value movements  are recognized in the other comprehensive income  (OCI).
However, the Company recognizes interest  income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign  exchange gain or loss in the P&L.
On derecognition  of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously  recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to  P&L.
Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt  instrument is reported as interest income using the  EIR method.
2.15.2.3  Debt instr ument at FVTPL   FVTPL  is a residual category for debt instruments.
Any debt instrument, which does not meet the  criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or  as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
In  addition, the Company may elect to designate a  debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized  cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.
However,  such election is allowed only if doing so reduces  or eliminates a measurement or recognition  inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting  mismatch’).
The Company has not designated any  debt instrument as at FVTPL.
Debt  instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.
2.15.2.4  Equity  investments in subsidiaries, associates                 and Joint Ventures  In  accordance of Ind AS 101 (First time adoption of  Ind AS), the carrying amount of these investments  as per previous GAAP as on the date of transition  is considered to be the deemed cost.
Subsequently  Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint  ventures are measured at cost.
In  case of consolidated financial statement, Equity  investments in associates and joint ventures are  accounted as per equity method as prescribed in  para 10 of Ind AS 28.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 268 A Maharatna Company 2.15.2.5  Other Equity In vestment  All  other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
F or all other equity instruments, the Company may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes in the  fair value.
The Company makes such election on an  instrument by-instrument basis.
The classification  is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
If  the Company decides to classify an equity  instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes on the instrument, excluding dividends,  are recognized in the OCI.
There is no recycling  of the amounts from OCI to P&L even on sale of  investment.
However, the Company may transfer  the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity  instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognized in the P&L.
2.15.2.6  Derecognition   A  financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a  financial asset or part of a group of similar financial  assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e.
removed  from the balance sheet) when:  •  The  rights to receive cash flows from the asset  have expired, or  •  The  Company has transferred its rights to receive  cash flows from the asset or has assumed an  obligation to pay the received cash flows in full  without material delay to a third party under a  ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the  Company has transferred substantially all the risks  and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has  neither transferred nor retained substantially all the  risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred  control of the asset.
When  the Company has transferred its rights to  receive cash flows from an asset or has entered  into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and  to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards  of ownership.
When it has neither transferred nor  retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of  the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the  Company continues to recognise the transferred  asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing  involvement.
In that case, the Company also  recognises an associated liability.
The transferred  asset and the associated liability are measured  on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations  that the Company has retained.
Continuing  involvement that takes the form of a guarantee  over the transferred asset is measured at the lower  of the original carrying amount of the asset and  the maximum amount of consideration that the  Company could be required to repay.
2.15.2.7  Impair ment of financial assets (other than fair      v alue)  In  accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company  applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for  measurement and recognition of impairment loss  on the following financial assets and credit risk  exposure:  a)  Financial  assets that are debt instruments, and  are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt  securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank  balance  b)  Financial  assets that are debt instruments and are  measured as at FVTOCI  c)  Lease receiv ables under Ind AS 17  d)  T rade receivables or any contractual right to  receive cash or another financial asset that result  from transactions that are within the scope of Ind  AS 11 and Ind AS 18   The  Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on:  •  T rade receivables or contract revenue receivables;  and  •  All  lease receivables resulting from transactions  within the scope of Ind AS 17   The  application of simplified approach does not  require the Company to track changes in credit risk.
Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance  based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date,  right from its initial recognition.
2.15.3  Financial liabilities 2.15.3.1Initial recognition and measurement     The  Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other  payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts.
All  financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value  and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net  of directly attributable transaction costs.
2.15.3.2Subsequent measurement     The  measurement of financial liabilities depends on their  classification, as described below:  2.15.3.3 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss     Financial  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include  financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities  designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through  profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for  trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing  in the near term.
This category also includes derivative  financial instruments entered into by the Company that  are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge  relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
Separated  embedded derivatives are also classified as held for  trading unless they are designated as effective hedging  instruments.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 269 2016 - 2017   Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised  in the profit or loss.
Financial  liabilities designated upon initial recognition at  fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at  the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind  AS 109 are satisfied.
For liabilities designated as FVTPL,  fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own  credit risk are recognized in OCI.
These gains/ loss are not  subsequently transferred to P&L.
However, the Company  may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
All  other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised  in the statement of profit and loss.
The Company has not  designated any financial liability as at fair value through  profit and loss.
2.15.3.4 Financial liabilities at amortised cost    After  initial recognition, these are subsequently measured  at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the  liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective  interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is  calculated by taking into account any discount or premium  on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part  of the effective interest rate.
The effective interest rate  amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement  of profit and loss.
This category generally applies to  borrowings.
2.15.3.5Derecognition     A  financial liability is derecognised when the obligation  under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another  from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the  terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such  an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition  of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial  liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or  transferred to another party and the consideration paid,  including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities  assumed, shall be recognised in profit or loss.
2.154 Reclassification of financial assets   The  Company determines classification of financial assets  and liabilities on initial recognition.
After initial recognition, no  reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity  instruments and financial liabilities.
For financial assets which  are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is  a change in the business model for managing those assets.
Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent.
The Company’s senior management determines change in the  business model as a result of external or internal changes which  are significant to the Company’s operations.
Such changes are  evident to external parties.
A change in the business model  occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform  an activity that is significant to its operations.
If Company  reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification  prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day  of the immediately next reporting period following the change in  business model.
The Company does not restate any previously  recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses)  or interest.
The following table shows various reclassification and how they are  accounted for Original  classification  Revised  classification  Accounting treatment Amortised  cost  FVTPL Fair value is measured  at reclassification date.
Difference between previous  amortized cost and fair value  is recognised in P&L.
FVTPL Amortised  Cost  Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new gross  carrying amount.
EIR is  calculated based on the new  gross carrying amount.
Amortised  cost  FVTOCI Fair value is measured  at reclassification date.
Difference between previous  amortised cost and fair  value is recognised in OCI.
No change in EIR due to  reclassification.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new  amortised cost carrying  amount.
However, cumulative  gain or loss in OCI is  adjusted against fair value.
Consequently, the asset is  measured as if it had always  been measured at amortised  cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassification  date becomes its new  carrying amount.
No other  adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be  measured at fair value.
Cumulative gain or loss  previously recognized in OCI  is reclassified to P&L at the  reclassification date.
2.15.5  Offsetting of financial instr uments     Financial  assets and financial liabilities are offset and the  net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet  if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on  a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously.
2.16.
Borr owing Costs    Borro wing costs are expensed as and when incurred except  where they are directly attributable to the acquisition,  construction or production of qualifying assets i.e.
the  assets that necessarily takes substantial period of time  to get ready for its intended use, in which case they are  COAL INDIA LIMITED 270 A Maharatna Company capitalised as part of the cost of those asset up to the date  when the qualifying asset is ready for its intended use.
2.17   T axation     Income  tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently  payable and deferred tax.
Current  tax is the amount of income taxes payable  (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for  a period.
Taxable profit differs from “profit before income  tax” as reported in the statement of profit and loss and  other comprehensive income because it excludes items  of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in  other years and it further excludes items that are never  taxable or deductible.
The company’s liability for current  tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Def erred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable  temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are generally  recognised for all deductible temporary difference to the  extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available  against which those deductible temporary differences can  be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if  the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the  initial recognition (other than in a business combination)  of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects  neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Def erred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and  associates, except where the company is able to control the  reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that  the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable  future.
Deferred tax assets arising from deductible  temporary differences associated with such investments  and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is  probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against  which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences.
The  carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at  the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent  that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will  be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the  end of each reporting year and are recognised to the extent  that it has become probable that sufficient taxable profit will  be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to  be recovered.
Def erred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax  rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the  liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate  (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the end of the reporting period.
The  measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets  reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the  manner in which the company expects, at the end of the  reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of  its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case,  the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.
Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial  accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is  included in the accounting for the business combination.
2.18  Emplo yee Benefits 2.18.1 Short-term Benefits    All  short term employee benefits are recognized in the  period in which they are incurred.
2.18.2 Post-employment benefits and other long term   employee benefits 2.18.2.1  Defined contr ibutions plans  A  defined contribution plan is a post-employment  benefit plan for Provident fund and Pension under  which the company pays fixed contribution into  fund maintained by a separate statutory body  (Coal Mines Provident Fund) constituted under  an enactment of law and the company will have  no legal or constructive obligation to pay further  amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined  contribution plans are recognised as an employee  benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss  in the periods during which services are rendered  by employees.
2.18.2.2  Defined benefits plans  A  defined benefit plan is a post-employment  benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
Gratuity, leave encashment are defined benefit  plans (with ceilings on benefits).
The company’s  net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans  is calculated by estimating the amount of future  benefit that employees have earned in return of  their service in the current and prior periods.
The  benefit is discounted to determine its present value  and reduced by the fair value of plan assets, if  any.
The discount rate is based on the prevailing  market yields of Indian Government securities  as at the reporting date that have maturity dates  approximating the terms of the company’s  obligations and that are denominated in the same  currency in which the benefits are expected to  be paid.
The  application of actuarial valuation involves  making assumptions about discount rate, expected  rates of return on assets, future salary increases,  mortality rates etc.
Due to the long term nature  of these plans, such estimates are subject to  uncertainties.
The calculation is performed at each  balance sheet by an actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
When the calculation results in  to the benefit to the company, the recognised asset  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 271 2016 - 2017 is limited to the present value of the economic  benefits available in the form of any future refunds  from the plan or reduction in future contributions  to the plan.
An economic benefit is available to the  company if it is realisable during the life of the plan,  or on settlement of plan liabilities.
Re-measurement  of the net defined benefit  liability, which comprise actuarial gain and losses  considering the return on plan assets (excluding  interest) and the effects of the assets ceiling (if any,  excluding interest) are recognised immediately in  the other comprehensive income.
The company  determines the net interest expense (income) on  the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period  by applying the discount rate used to measure  the defined benefit obligation at the beginning  of the annual period to the then net defined  benefit liability (asset), taking into account any  changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset)  during the period as a result of contributions and  benefit payments.
Net interest expense and other  expenses related to defined benefit plans are  recognised in profit and loss.
When  the benefits of the plan are improved, the  portion of the increased benefit relating to past  service by employees is recognised as expense  immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
2.18.3   Other Emplo yee benefits      Cer tain other employee benefits namely benefit  on account of LTA, LTC, Life Cover scheme, Group  personal Accident insurance scheme, settlement  allowance, post-retirement medical benefit scheme  and compensation to dependents of deceased in  mine accidents etc., are also recognised on the  same basis as described above for defined benefits  plan.
These benefits do not have specific funding.
2.19Foreign Currency  The  company’s reported currency and the functional currency  for majority of its operations is in Indian Rupees (INR) being  the principal currency of the economic environment in which it  operates.
T ransactions in foreign currencies are converted into the  reported currency of the company using the exchange rate  prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies outstanding at the end of the  reporting period are translated at the exchange rates prevailing  as at the end of reporting period.
Exchange differences arising  on the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities or on  translating monetary assets and liabilities at rates different from  those at which they were translated on initial recognition during  the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in  statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Non-monetar y items denominated in foreign currency are  valued at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of  transactions.
2.20 Stripping Activity Expense/Adjustment  In  case of opencast mining, the mine waste materials  (“overburden”) which consists of soil and rock on the top of coal  seam is required to be removed to get access to the coal and its  extraction.
This waste removal activity is known as ‘Stripping’.
In  opencast mines, the company has to incur such expenses over  the life of the mine (as technically estimated).
Theref ore, as a policy, in the mines with rated capacity of  one million tonnes per annum and above, cost of Stripping is  charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio (OB:  COAL) at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity  asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to  revenue.
Net  of balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance  at the Balance Sheet date is shown as Stripping Activity  Adjustment under the head Non - Current Provisions / Other  Non-Current Assets as the case may be.
The  reported quantity of overburden as per record is considered  in calculating the ratio for OBR accounting where the variance  between reported quantity and measured quantity is within  the lower of the two alternative permissible limits, as detailed  hereunder:- Annual Quantum of OBR Of the Mine Permissible limits of variance I II % Quantum (in  Mill.
Cu.
Mtr.)
Less than 1 Mill.
CUM +/- 5% 0.03 Between 1 and 5 Mill.
CUM +/- 3% 0.20 More than 5 Mill.
CUM  +/- 2%  Ho wever, where the variance is beyond the permissible limits  as above, the measured quantity is considered.
In  case of mines with rated capacity of less than one million tonne,  the above policy is not applied and actual cost of stripping activity  incurred during the year is recognised in Statement of Profit and  Loss.
2.21Inventories 2.21.1  Stoc k of Coal    In ventories of coal/coke are stated at lower of cost and net  realisable value.
Cost of inventories are calculated using  the First in First out method.
Net realisable value represents  the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated  costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Book  stock of coal is considered in the accounts where the  variance between book stock and measured stock is up to  +/- 5% and in cases where the variance is beyond +/- 5%  the measured stock is considered.
Such stock are valued  at net realisable value or cost whichever is lower.
Coke is  considered as a part of stock of coal.
Coal  & coke-fines are valued at lower of cost or net  realisable value and considered as a part of stock of coal.
Slurr y (coking/semi-coking), middling of washeries and by  products are valued at net realisable value and considered  as a part of stock of coal.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 272 A Maharatna Company 2.21.2 Stores & Spares    The  Stock of stores & spare parts (which also includes  loose tools) at central & area stores are considered as  per balances appearing in priced stores ledger and are  valued at cost calculated on the basis of weighted average  method.
The inventory of stores & spare parts lying at  collieries / sub-stores / drilling camps/ consuming centres  are considered at the yearend only as per physically  verified stores and are valued at cost.
Pro visions are made at the rate of 100% for unserviceable,  damaged and obsolete stores and spares and at the rate of  50% for stores & spares not moved for 5 years.
2.21.3 Other Inventories    W orkshop jobs including work-in-progress are valued  at cost.
Stock of press jobs (including work in progress)  and stationary at printing press and medicines at central  hospital are valued at cost.
Ho wever, Stock of stationery (other than lying at printing  press), bricks, sand, medicine (except at Central Hospitals),  aircraft spares and scraps are not considered in inventory  considering their value not being significant.
2.22Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets   Pro visions are recognized when the company has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,  and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be  required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the  amount of the obligation can be made.
Where the time value of  money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of  the expenditure expected to settle the obligation.
All  provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and  adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where  it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits  will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably,  the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the  probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Possible  obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future uncertain  events not wholly within the control of the company, are also  disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of  outflow of economic benefits is remote.
Contingent  Assets are not recognised in the financial  statements.
However, when the realisation of income is virtually  certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its  recognition is appropriate.
2.23Earnings per share  Basic  earnings per share are computed by dividing the net  profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per shares  is computed by dividing the profit after tax by the weighted  average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic  earnings per shares and also the weighted average number of  equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of  all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.24 Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions   The  preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  Ind AS requires management to make estimates, judgements  and assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of  financial statements and the amount of revenue and expenses  during the reported period.
Application of accounting policies  involving complex and subjective judgements and the use of  assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimate are recognised in the period  in which the estimates are revised and, if material, their effects  are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
2.24.1 Judgements   In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies,  management has made the following judgements, which have  the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the  financial statements: 2.24.1.1 Formulation of Accounting Policies    Accounting  policies are formulated in a manner that result  in financial statements containing relevant and reliable  information about the transactions, other events and  conditions to which they apply.
Those policies need not be  applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.
In  the absence of an Ind AS that specifically applies to  a transaction, other event or condition, management  has used its judgement in developing and applying an  accounting policy that results in information that is:    a)  rele vant to the economic decision-making needs of  users and     b)  reliab le in that financial statements :  (i)  represent  faithfully the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company; (ii) reflect  the economic substance of transactions, other events and  conditions, and not merely the legal form; (iii) are neutral,  i.e.
free from bias; (iv) are prudent; and (v) are complete in  all material respects on a consistent basis    In  making the judgement management refers to, and  considers the applicability of, the following sources in  descending order:    (a)  the  requirements in Ind ASs dealing with similar and  related issues; and    (b)  the  definitions, recognition criteria and measurement  concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses in  the Framework.
In  making the judgement, management considers the  most recent pronouncements of International Accounting  Standards Board and in absence thereof those of the  other standard-setting bodies that use a similar conceptual  framework to develop accounting standards, other  accounting literature and accepted industry practices, to  the extent that these do not conflict with the sources in  above paragraph.
The  Company operates in the mining sector (a sector  where the exploration, evaluation, development production  phases are based on the varied topographical and  geomining terrain spread over the lease period running over  decades and prone to constant changes), the accounting  policies whereof have evolved based on specific industry  practices supported by research committees and approved  by the various regulators owing to its consistent application  over the last several decades.
In the absence of specific  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 273 2016 - 2017 accounting literature, guidance and standards in certain  specific areas which are in the process of evolution.
The  Company continues to strive to develop accounting policies  in line with the development of accounting literature and any  development therein shall be accounted for prospectively  as per the procedure laid down above more particularly in  Ind AS 8.
The  financial statements are prepared on going concern  basis using accrual basis of accounting.
2.24.1.2   Materiality     Ind  AS applies to items which are material.
Management  uses judgement in deciding whether individual items or  groups of item are material in the financial statements.
Materiality is judged by reference to the size and nature  of the item.
The deciding factor is whether omission or  misstatement could individually or collectively influence  the economic decisions that users make on the basis  of the financial statements.
Management also uses  judgement of materiality for determining the compliance  requirement of the Ind AS.
In particular circumstances  either the nature or the amount of an item or aggregate  of items could be the determining factor.
Further the  Company may also be required to present separately  immaterial items when required by law.
2.24.1.3  Operating lease      Compan y has entered into lease agreements.
The  Company has determined, based on an evaluation of  the terms and conditions of the arrangements, such  as the lease term not constituting a major part of the  economic life of the commercial property and the fair  value of the asset, that it retains all the significant risks  and rewards of ownership of these properties and  accounts for the contracts as operating leases.
2.24.2   Estimates and assumptions      The  key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are  described below.
The Company based its assumptions  and estimates on parameters available when the  consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future  developments, however, may change due to market  changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the  control of the Company.
Such changes are reflected in  the assumptions when they occur.
2.24.2.1  Impairment of non-financial assets      There  is an indication of impairment if, the carrying  value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its  recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value  less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Company  considers individual mines as separate cash generating  units for the purpose of test of impairment.
The value  in use calculation is based on a DCF model.
The cash  flows are derived from the budget for the next five  years and do not include restructuring activities that the  Company is not yet committed to or significant future  investments that will enhance the asset’s performance  of the CGU being tested.
The recoverable amount is  sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as  well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth  rate used for extrapolation purposes.
These estimates  are most relevant to other mining infrastructures.
The  key assumptions used to determine the recoverable  amount for the different CGUs, are disclosed and  further explained in respective notes.
2.24.2.2   Taxes      Def erred tax assets are recognised for unused tax  losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable  profit will be available against which the losses can be  utilised.
Significant management judgement is required  to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can  be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level  of future taxable profits together with future tax planning  strategies.
2.24.2.3  Defined benefit plans      The  cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and other  post-employment medical benefits and the present  value of the gratuity obligation are determined using  actuarial valuations.
An actuarial valuation involves  making various assumptions that may differ from  actual developments in the future.
These include  the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates.
Due  to the complexities involved in the valuation and  its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is  highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount  rate.
In determining the appropriate discount rate for  plans operated in India, the management considers  the interest rates of government bonds in currencies  consistent with the currencies of the post-employment  benefit obligation.
The  mortality rate is based on publicly available  mortality tables of the country.
Those mortality  tables tend to change only at interval in response  to demographic changes.
Future salary increases  and gratuity increases are based on expected future  inflation rate.
2.24.2.4  F air value measurement of financial instruments      When  the fair values of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using generally accepted  valuation techniques including the DCF model.
The  inputs to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not feasible,  a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair  values.
Judgements include considerations of inputs  such as liquidity risk, credit risk, volatility and other  relevant input /considerations.
Changes in assumptions  and estimates about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of financial instruments.
2.24.2.5  Intangib le asset under development      The  Company capitalises intangible asset under  development for a project in accordance with the  accounting policy.
Initial capitalisation of costs is based  on management’s judgement that technological and  COAL INDIA LIMITED 274 A Maharatna Company economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a project report is formulated and approved.
2.24.2.6  Pr ovision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation     In  determining the fair value of the provision for Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning Obligation, assumptions  and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of site restoration and dismantling and the expected  timing of those costs.
The Company estimates provision using the DCF method considering life of the project/mine based on 			l  Estimated cost per hectare as specified in guidelines issued b y Ministry of Coal, Government of India 			l  The discount rate (pre tax rate) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific  to the liability.

Fir st time adoption of Ind AS These financial statements of the Company, for the year ended  31st March 2017, are the first financial statements prepared in  accordance with Ind AS.
For periods up to and including the year  ended 31st March 2016, the Company prepared its financial  statements in accordance with accounting standards notified  under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with  paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (erstwhile  - Indian GAAP).
Accordingly, the Company has prepared financial  statements which comply with Ind AS applicable for periods ending  on 31st March 2017, together with the comparative period data  as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016, as described in  the summary of significant accounting policies.
In preparing these  financial statements, the Company’s opening balance sheet was  prepared as at 1st April 2015, the Company’s date of transition  to Ind AS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by  the Company in restating its Indian GAAP financial statements,  including the balance sheet as at 1st April 2015 and the financial  statements as at and for the year ended 31st March 2016.
Exemptions applied Ind AS 101 allows first-time adopters certain  exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements  under Ind AS.
The Company has applied the following exemptions:  (i)  F air value measurement of financial assets or financial liabilities  (Ind AS 101.D20)  First-time  adopters may apply Ind AS 109 to day one gain or  loss provisions prospectively to transactions occurring on or  after the date of transition to Ind AS.
Therefore, unless a first- time adopter elects to apply Ind AS 109 retrospectively to day  one gain or loss transactions, transactions that occurred prior to  the date of transition to Ind AS do not need to be retrospectively  restated.
As  a first time adopter of Ind AS, the Company has opted to  apply Ind AS 109 prospectively.
(ii)  Mine  Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation in Property, Plant and Equipment (Ind AS 101.D21)  Appendix  ‘A’ to Ind AS 16 Changes in Existing Decommissioning,  Restoration and Similar Liabilities requires specified changes  in a decommissioning, restoration or similar liability to be added  to or deducted from the cost of the asset to which it relates; the  adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is then depreciated  prospectively over its remaining useful life.
A first-time adopter  need not comply with these requirements for changes in such  liabilities that occurred before the date of transition to Ind AS.
In  other words, a first-time adopter will not need to estimate what  provision would have been calculated at earlier reporting dates.
Instead, the decommissioning liability is calculated at the date  of transition and it is assumed that the same liability (adjusted  only for the time value of money) existed when the asset was  first acquired/constructed.
As  a first time adopter of Ind AS, the Company has calculated  the Mine Closure, Site Restoration and Decommissioning  Obligation at the date of transition assuming that the same  liability (present value) existed when the asset was first  acquired/constructed.
Reconciliation  of Equity as prepared under Indian GAAP with  equity restated under Ind AS is summarised below: (` in Crore) Sl.

(b)  F air value hierarchy The Company uses the judgments and estimates in determining  the fair values of the financial instruments that are recognised and  measured at fair value.
To provide an indication about the reliability  of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has  classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed  under the accounting standard.
An explanation of each level is  given below.
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured  using quoted prices.
This includes mutual funds that have quoted  price and are valued using the closing NAV .
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded  in an active market is determined using valuation techniques  which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as  little as possible on entity-specific estimates.
If all significant inputs  required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument  is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on  observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
This is the case for unlisted equity securities, preference shares  borrowings, security deposits and other liabilities taken included in  level 3.
COAL INDIA LIMITED 312 A Maharatna Company Mutual Fund Investments are classified as FVTPL have been  valued as per Level I of Fair Value Hierarchy.
(c)  V aluation technique used in determining fair value  V aluation techniques used to value financial instruments  include the use of quoted market prices of instruments.
(d)  F air value measurements using significant unobservable  inputs  At  present there are no fair value measurements using  significant unobservable inputs.
(e)  F air values of financial assets and liabilities measured at  amortised cost  •  The  carrying amounts of trade receivables, short term  deposits, cash and cash equivalents, trade payables are  considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their  short-term nature.
•  The  Company considers that the Security Deposits  does not include a significant financing component.
The  milestone payments (security deposits) coincide with  the company’s performance and the contract requires  amounts to be retained for reasons other than the provision  of finance.
The withholding of a specified percentage of  each milestone payment is intended to protect the interest  of the company, from the contractor failing to adequately  complete its obligations under the contract.
Accordingly  transaction cost of Security deposit is considered as fair  value at initial recognition and subsequently measured at  amortised cost.
Significant  estimates: The fair value of financial instruments  that are not traded in an active market is determined using  valuation techniques.
The Company uses its judgment to select  a method and makes suitable assumptions at the end of each  reporting period.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 313 2016 - 2017 The Company risk management is carried out by the board of  directors as per DPE guidelines issued by Government of India.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management  as well as policies covering investment of excess liquidity.
A.
Credit  Risk: Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents,  investments carried at amortised cost and deposits with banks  and financial institutions, as well as including outstanding  receivables.
Credit risk management: Receivables arise mainly out of sale of Coal.
Sale of Coal is broadly  categorized as sale through fuel supply agreements (FSAs) and  e-auction.
Macro - economic information (such as regulatory changes) is  incorporated as part of the fuel supply agreements (FSAs) and  e-auction terms Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) As contemplated in and in accordance with the terms of the New  Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP), the company enters into legally  enforceable FSAs with customers or with State Nominated Agencies  that in turn enters into appropriate distribution arrangements with  end customers.
Our FSAs can be broadly categorized into: •  FSAs with customers in the power utilities sector, including  State power utilities, private power utilities (“PPUs”) and  independent power producers (“IPPs”); •  FSAs  with customers in non-power industries (including captive  power plants (“CPPs”)); and •  FSAs with State Nominated Agencies .
E-Auction Scheme The E-Auction scheme of coal has been introduced to provide  access to coal for customers who were not able to source their coal  requirement through the available institutional mechanisms under  the NCDP for various reasons, for example, due to a less than full  allocation of their normative requirement under NCDP , seasonality  of their coal requirement and limited requirement of coal that does  not warrant a long-term linkage.
The quantity of coal to be offered  under E-Auction is reviewed from time to time by the Ministry of  Coal.
Provision for expected credit loss: The Company provides for  expected credit risk loss for doubtful/ credit impaired assets, by  lifetime expected credit losses (Simplified approach).
Expected Credit losses for trade receivables under simplified approach As on 31.03.2017  ( ` in Crore) Ageing Due for 2  months Due for 6  months Due for 1  year Due for 2  year Due for 3  year Due for more  than 3 year Total Gross carrying amount  5,273.36  3,520.26  1,876.62  2,118.56  561.30 1,168.57  14,518.67 Expected loss rate 14.30% 23.14% 32.97% 14.30% 46.12% 88.43%   Expected credit losses  (Loss allowance provision)  754.32  814.70  618.66  302.94  258.86 1,033.34  3,782.82  As on 31.03.2016  ( ` in Crore) Ageing Due for 2  months Due for 6  months Due for 1  year Due for 2  year Due for 3  year Due for more  than 3 year Total Gross carrying amount  6,381.81  2,183.18  1,419.66 999.35  1,420.76  1,263.05 13,667.81 Expected loss rate 2.34% 6.99% 12.32% 25.92% 24.96% 89.42%   Expected credit losses  (Loss allowance provision)  149.63  152.60  174.84  259.05  354.61 1,129.47 2,220.20 As on 01.04.2015  ( ` in Crore) Ageing Due for 2  months Due for 6  months Due for 1  year Due for 2  year Due for 3  year Due for more  than 3 year Total Gross carrying amount  2,594.58  2,747.16  853.98  2,891.64 777.78  1,126.37  10,991.51 Expected loss rate 2.36% 3.70% 9.52% 31.66% 49.98% 85.40%   Expected credit losses  (Loss allowance provision)  61.21  101.55  81.29  915.59  388.72  961.96  2,510.32 COAL INDIA LIMITED 314 A Maharatna Company Reconciliation of loss allowance provision – Trade receivables   (` in Crore) Loss allowance on 01.04.2015  2,510.32  Change in loss allowance  -290.12  Loss allowance on 31.03.2016  2,220.20  Changes in loss allowance 1,562.62 Loss allowance on 31.03.2017 3782.82 Significant estimates and judgments for Impairment of   financial assets The impairment provisions for financial assets disclosed   above are based on assumptions about risk of default   and expected loss rates.
The Company uses judgment in   making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to  the impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past   history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking  estimates at the end of each reporting period.
B.
Liquidity Risk Pr udent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient  cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding  through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet  obligations when due.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying  businesses, Company treasury maintains flexibility in funding by  maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
Management monitors forecasts of the Company’s liquidity position  (comprising the undrawn borrowing facilities) and cash and cash  equivalents on the basis of expected cash flows.
This is generally  carried out at local level in the operating companies of the Company  in accordance with practice and limits set by the Company.
