VALUES At the core of Wipro is the “Spirit of Wipro” .
It encapsulates the values,  which are the guiding principles for our culture and behaviour in Wipro.
It binds us together and inspires us to achieve excellence in whatever  we do.
WIPRO IN BRIEF SPIRIT OF WIPRO IDENTIFIE S THREE CORE VALUES Intensity to Win •	 Make customers successful •	 Team, innovate, excel Act with Sensitivity •	 Respect for the individual •	 Thoughtful and Responsible  Unyielding Integrity •	 Delivering on commitments •	 Honesty and fairness in action  4 Annual Report 2015-16 THE FUTURE BELONGS  TO THOSE WHO MAKE IT Wipro Limited 5 DIGITAL TRANSFORMS E VERYTHING Everyday experiences are no longer what they used to be.
Buying a  car, depositing money, booking accommodation, monitoring /f_itness,  trying on clothes and even telling the time are activities unrecognizable  from just a few years ago.
New products and services promising greater  relevance and higher value have transformed, at lightening speed, the  way we live and work.
Our world is exploding with data, devices, content and touchpoints.
Increasingly, enterprises require more platforms, systems and processes  to connect and make sense of the complexity and determine the ways  in which brands remain relevant to /f_irst-time buyers and long-time  loyalists.
This disruption is the new normal and there is no sign of this  slowing down.
As a result, industries, businesses, consumers and our  clients are experiencing fundamental challenges.
No industry, business model or company can look the other way.
The  average lifespan of a Fortune 500 company has dropped from 75  years to 15 years.
The unbundling of traditional products and services  requires a change in how businesses operate and deliver relevance and  value to consumers.
Business today needs to be redesigned and rebuilt for a world where  experience de/f_ines value, velocity determines growth and scale is  achieved not by big and few but by small and many.
The businesses that will succeed today are the ones that will oﬀer new  sources of values, deliver a delightful customer experience, adapt at  high velocity and tap innovation globally.
VALUE BEYOND Businesses are created to oﬀer value.
Now, value must go beyond the  product, service, store and channel.
New sources of value are found  at the edge, on the periphery of existing domains, and once unlocked  will deliver new sources of revenue and growth.
To /f_ind new sources of  value one requires a new way of working, a multi-disciplinary approach,  bringing together strategy, design and technology.
When an engineer knows how to design, a strategist knows how to code  or a designer knows how to roadmap organizational change, new ways  of colloborative working breakdown traditional siloed and inside-out  thinking.
In its place grows an outside-in approach to de/f_ining products  and services, one that is led and informed by the customer experience.
Entirely new perspectives now create the most compelling, personal,  relevant and meaningful product or service.
These experience-led  enterprises, combined with high velocity and global scale, will be the  ones to transform industries and deliver value beyond.
6 Annual Report 2015-16 into viable propositions, underpinned by intelligent  operations and into the hands of customers.
Therefore, enabling high velocity change requires  simpli/f_ication of traditional development and operations  practices.
Both are interrelated and complementary,  but they diﬀer in nature.
Digitally /f_it operations reduce  waste, uncertainty and variation in order to create  eﬃciency.
Modern engineering disciplines cut feedback  loops through automation, allowing teams to exploit  uncertainty and variation quickly and repeatedly  throughout an adaptive design process.
We help our clients create a platform to learn from  experiments, especially from failures for solving  ambiguous problems and exploiting innovative ideas.
For instance, in 2015-16, we took a global bank from  tightly coupled, /f_ixed and interdependent systems to a  responsive, /f_luid and participative architecture capable  of releasing new features and updates on demand.
This  resulted in improved experiences for customers and  signi/f_icant savings for the bank.
GLOBAL SCALE Traditionally, global scale is thought to describe size,  breadth and presence around the world.
While any large  multi-national may bring this type of scale to clients,  global scale, for us,  means much more.
For us and our  clients, it means the ability to innovate at global scale.
Innovation may come from a startup in a garage half- way around the world, an arti/f_icial intelligence platform  like Wipro HOLMESTM, an unrelated industry setting new  standards for customer experience or a small eco-system  partner with big ambition.
Today’s digital business needs  to tap into all sources of traditional and non-traditional  innovation.
Because this is transformational, clients need a diﬀerent  method that goes beyond siloed, inside-out thinking.
We  start with insights into customer needs and expectations  – insights that are disruptive, forward-looking and  unbound by standard industry expectations.
Insights lead  to dreaming and designing future experiences.
Building,  delivering and continuously improving experiences at  scale and with velocity completes the transformation of  product-service experiences for customers.
A large electronics client of Wipro believes, that in future,  revenues will come from connected devices and not from  products.
This client relies on Wipro to support their end- EXPERIENCE/hyphen.capLED Successful businesses go beyond simply delivering  products and services.
They design and deliver  experiences centered around the customer, not a  technology or business process.
An example of this  approach is what we are doing at Chelsea Football Club  to transform fan experiences in-stadium on game day  and beyond, harnessing digital to ensure there is no fan  too far from the action.
Not only does this require an outside-in approach, it  requires new types of workers.
It requires talent that  is x-shaped (multi-skilled), not uni-disciplinary, which  brings complimentary but diverse skill sets.
HIGH VELOCI TY In a rapidly evolving landscape, Digital businesses  must have a bias towards action.
Moving away from a  product-/f_irst mindset to an experience-/f_irst mindset,  companies need to embrace experimentation as well as   rapid, reliable and continuous deployment.
Competitive  advantage of the future is linked to better, faster and  more relevant experiences.
The goal is to incrementally craft brand-de/f_ining  experiences, quickly and eﬃciently shaping ideas   Wipro Limited 7 to-end transformation, integrating internal and external  value chains that provide new sources of revenue and  new product-service experiences for consumers.
DELIVERING AS BIG AS WE CAN DREAM Our heritage lies in technology.
Wipro is known around  the world for deep expertise in building and running  systems.
Today, Wipro is changing.
Understanding  technology is no longer enough.
This year, Wipro acquired one of the world’s leading  strategic design companies, Designit, and invested  internally to create Buildit™, a high caliber studio-based  engineering capability.
We believe design is not simply about making things  look good.
Strategic design makes the world a better  place.
Strategic design /f_ixes unusable systems, improves  terrible experiences, innovates new services and creates  products that go beyond category.
Put simply, design  drives human-shaped products, services and help  radically simplify digital environments, in a future where  there is no market for complicated.
Similarly, engineering great experiences is not something  you can codify.
It is much more subtle, complex and  elusive.
It is a people thing - the right blend of talent, an  eﬀective unit, equipped to discover and create things  that matter to you and me.
For this, you need to create  DESIGN IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT  MAKING THINGS LOOK G OOD.
STRATEGIC DESIGN MAKES THE  WORLD A BETTER  PLACE.
the right environment, you need the ability to /f_igure  out what’s not working when it’s not, and the ability to  /f_ix it so it does.
You need a place where people safely  try, stumble, fall, learn, and try something else - quickly  and often.
The prize is special – an experience that, for  a moment, delights someone, time and again.
A good  example is what we are doing for a global technology  company, where we are bringing the combined strength  of our digital, engineering and Designit teams to redesign  and reengineer how they work by creating a platform to  develop iteratively and deliver lasting product-service  experiences in collaboration with their clients.
When design and build mindsets are fused together,  the continuous evolution of technology results in  experiences that no longer trail consumer behavior but  rather make brand-de/f_ining moments and create new  markets.
Designing and building new experiences makes  today’s businesses into human centric enterprises.
When  Digital is approached in this manner large, Digital drives  large corporations to innovate like startups.
Combining strategic design with strategic technology  is our future.
Strategic design creates new experiences  continuously.
Strategic technology brings new  experiences into the hands of end-users continuously.
The future belongs to those who understand that it’s  not about system speci/f_ication but end-user expectation  and experience.
The future belongs to those who Design  it and Build it.
The future belongs to those who make it.

The sharp drop in oil prices in 2014-15 sustained  through 2015-16, aﬀecting the energy economy.
US saw  an improving labor market and started the journey of  rate hikes.
Continental Europe shows mixed trends even  as many emerging market economies such as Brazil are  under economic recession.
China’s economy, in the midst  of a structural adjustment, is a concern.
India continued  to be a bright spot in the global economy with the  economy growing by 7.6%.
Overall, the outlook is stable  for economies that form key markets for Wipro.
In 2015-16, Gross Revenues of the Company crossed the  landmark of Rs.
50,000 crores and grew by 9% YoY.
Net  Income for the year grew by 3% YoY to Rs 8,892 crores.
Over the past five years, our organization continued  to transform into a next generation technology and  consulting company, with defining differentiators in  the market.
We have built a stronger customer facing  organization, increased our presence and wins in large  deals, developed effective capability enhancement  programs for employees and been at the forefront of  technology changes.
TK Kurien (TK), who led our Company  as the CEO till January 31, 2016 has been appointed  Executive Vice Chairman, effective February 1, 2016.
TK will focus on key strategic initiatives while also  providing continuity on client relationships without  disruption.
We announced the appointment of Abidali Neemuchwala  as Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Member of the Board of  Wipro Limited eﬀective February 1, 2016.
Abid joined  Wipro as Group President & Chief Operating Oﬃcer on  April 1, 2015.
In a short span of time, he has established  himself as a tall leader and won the respect and  acceptance of the leadership team.
His track record with  customers, passion for excellence and rigor in execution  makes him uniquely positioned to lead Wipro through the  next phase of growth.
The leadership structure is in place and this has been  one of the smoothest transitions we have had in a CEO  transition.
Both Abid and TK are working closely to build  on the solid foundation we have developed to drive  superior growth and pro/f_itability.
We are seeing pervasive change all around us.
Consumer  expectations and experiences, business models,  consumptions models and at times, entire industries are  getting fundamentally transformed.
Digital is pervading all our lives.
Experiences delivered on  Digital technology not just by humans but also machines  CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO THE  STAKEHOLDERS  Wipro Limited 11 is increasingly commonplace.
At Wipro, the concept of a Digital business is founded on  three principles:  it is experience-led, runs at high velocity,  is of  global scale and leverages the use of robotics.
This  de/f_inition of a Digital business requires new business  models, new ways of working and integrated capability  across strategy, design and technology.
We invested in signi/f_icantly up-skilling our employees in  Digital technologies to be able to service this demand.
We are also focused on increasing the diversity and  globalization of our workforce.
Today, our workforce  comprises employees from 100+ nationalities.
32% of  our employees are women.
We have more than 31,000  employees outside India, out of which 42% are locally  hired.
We are investing in building multiple innovation  and delivery centers across the globe.
We have always strived to enhance stakeholder value for  investors.
The Company’s philosophy is to provide regular,  stable and consistent payouts.
In line with this philosophy,  we announced a share buyback through a tender oﬀer  amounting to Rs 25,000 million in addition to dividends  of Rs.6 per share.
For the year 2015-16, dividends declared  and proposed, combined with the buyback amount will  enhance the payout ratio to 48% from 41% for the year  2014-15.
Just as /f_inancial capital is important for a /f_irm, so is human  capital, natural capital, social and relationship capital.
In this year’s Annual Report, we have articulated the  overall performance of the Company across these forms  of capital stock.
At the core of this articulation is the  integration of social and environment parameters within  the management discussion and analysis, in addition to  /f_inancial performance.
We continue to run very eﬀective programs related to  community and education domains.
Wipro Applying  Thought in Schools is Wipro’s social initiative in school  education that aims to build capacities for systemic reform  in India and has been running for over 15 years.
Wipro-earthian is Wipro’s Sustainability Education Program  which seeks to support and drive sustainability thinking  and action through the learning process in school and  colleges across India.
The program completed 5 years in  2015 and we achieved wide geographical representation  in 21 states, 45 districts and increased our reach to 2,000  schools, 1,500 colleges and 2,200 teachers.
We started the Wipro Science Education Fellowship  (SEF) in the US in 2013.
The key focus is to facilitate high  quality STEM education at the K-12 levels in US schools.
The program is currently running in Chicago, New  Jersey, New York and Boston.
The program works in close  collaboration in over 20 school districts wherein 250-350  teachers go through a 2 year fellowship with intense  support to develop their capacities to be better teachers  and change leaders.
The current commitment of Wipro to  these programs is about USD 8 million.
Wipro Cares engages with our proximate communities on  the issues of Education for the Underprivileged, Primary  Health-Care and Environment.
Wipro Cares also works on  long-term rehabilitation of aﬀected communities after  natural disasters.
Wipro Cares encourages employees  participation by contributing their time as well as  donations.
Wipro makes a matching contribution to the  donations.
As corporations continue to play their role of driving   responsible, sustainable businesses, I firmly believe  that owners of corporates are trustees of wealth, which  needs to be used for furthering social causes.
As I have  mentioned before, over these years I have irrevocably  transferred a signi/f_icant part of the shareholding in Wipro,  amounting to 39% of the shares of Wipro, to a Trust (of  which ownership in 21.14% was transferred and for  the balance the Trust is entitled to bene/f_icial interest of  dividends and sale proceeds).
The Trust supports the work  of The Azim Premji University and our grant making arm,  Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives.
As a result of this,  the excellence in business performance at Wipro  would  translate into value creation for shareholders, a substantial  portion of which would be towards social causes.
In 2015-16, Wipro achieved the milestone of its 70 th  anniversary and moved into its 71st year.
At this juncture,  I am grateful to all stakeholders- customers, employees,  suppliers, partners and investors – for their continuing  support to Wipro.
Very Sincerely, Azim Premji  12 Annual Report 2015-16 Dear Stakeholders, Last year was a momentous year for the technology  industry.
The discontinuities, which I have been talking  about in my previous interactions, is fast approaching.
Across the board, industries will undergo a fundamental  transformation that will not only create new markets, but  also give rise to new competitors who will operate with a  belief that traditional boundaries do not apply to them.
Enterprises that have used the web as just another sales  channel are now going to /f_ind that new-age enterprises  leverage simplicity and the power of technology to reach  the customer directly - with more customized oﬀerings  and delivery channels, at lower costs and often in units  of one.
Concepts of mass marketing and scale that have  driven enterprises for over 200 years, are now being  challenged.
To respond to this challenge, enterprises have to transform  not just their Sales and Supply chain channels but  also create the culture to access the larger ecosystem  seamlessly.
Likewise, organizations need to build  capability to harness the power of ideas from not just  within, but from anywhere in the world.
The other critical  change for organizations is that technology is no longer  a support function that can be handed over to a Chief  Technology Oﬃcer - it is front and center of all that is going  to happen.
In a way, the power to harness technology to  deliver dramatic impact is increasingly becoming a critical  skill across functions and levels.
It is sometimes easy to get fascinated or scared by these  changes.
Building perspective over a longer time frame,  enables us to better understand the current dynamic and  de/f_ine steps that technology companies like us need to  take, to remain relevant.
Information Technology, in its early days, used to be a  mechanism for processing data eﬃciently at large scale  and was used as a system of record.
Over time, this  led to improved process orchestration with seamless  flow of information to drive back-office enterprise  applications, ultimately leading to the internet being  central to consumer engagement.
Technology capability  has changed further with new paradigms - end-to-end  digitization, cloud-based delivery, actionable insights  from Artificial Intelligence (AI), and lastly mobility  becoming central to user-engagement.
Going forward,  business success will be increasingly driven by creative  integration of these capabilities across processes.
As an  instance, the industry will see the growing rise of robots  that will slowly integrate into the traditional workforce.
Traditional manufacturing is now already feeling the  impact of additive manufacturing.
In adjacent areas of the  value chain, supply chains are getting disrupted by drones  and service management by virtual reality.
VICE/hyphen.capCHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO  THE STAKEHOLDERS  Wipro Limited 13 Given this context, technology decisions are being  increasingly made by business users leading to a new  set of expectations and purchase constructs.
We see  many enterprises working around developing an  optimal operating model to address this - to balance the  eﬃciency from a traditional IT division with the innovation  opportunity arising from a deeper business linkage.
These disruptions demand Technology Consulting  organizations like ours to execute along two key themes-  •	 Engage closely with business users for new business  models that makes them more successful •	 Relook operations in traditional delivery to improve  eﬃciency & drive out cost on an accelerated basis   It will also be critical to help our customers through  the cultural and organizational change that these new  business models bring.
We believe that to deliver sustainable impact to our  customers, we will need to build deeper competency in  selected business processes - leveraging a combination  of process knowledge, AI and automation.
Given the  complexity of skills required to achieve a holistic view, we  have merged Consulting with Digital practice.
We are now focused around building algorithmic  capability and hyper-automation to signi/f_icantly reduce  cycle time for delivery, improve quality and reduce cost.
We have invested in developing targeted use cases  leveraging AI - our cognitive intelligence platform Holmes   has been deployed in over 18 customer engagements.
Additionally, we have made targeted acquisitions to  deepen customer presence and acquire capability in high  growth areas including platform-based services, Big Data,  Cyber Security and Internet of Things.
On the people front, we are driving signi/f_icant retraining  efforts to ensure that our workforce skills are in line  with new business expectations.
Our organizational  structure is also undergoing changes as we drive process  simpli/f_ication and reduce the number of layers to allow  for greater business agility.
These shifts have fundamental implications for Wipro and  require that we need to rewire ourselves for this new age.
Over the past few decades, we have been successful in  identifying waves and bene/f_iting from the disruptions.
This inherent DNA gives me the con/f_idence that we will  be able to make the right adjustments to thrive in the  current disruption.
In the midst of this churn, let me reiterate that we will  remain steadfast to our core values that we have observed  over the last 70 years - customer centricity, employee  sensitivity, integrity and sustainable development.
I feel very confident that Wipro is well placed for its  next phase of growth, with Abid at the helm.
He has  demonstrated a deep understanding of technology,  business vision, and an innate ability to bring people  together for a common purpose.
Let me close by thanking all of you for your support when I  was the CEO.
In my new role as Vice-Chairman, I am excited  to enable Abid achieve the goals he has articulated for the  company.
I look forward to your continued support as we  embark with renewed zeal on our journey.
Very Sincerely, T K Kurien 14 Annual Report 2015-16 Dear Stakeholders, It is an honor and privilege to be asked to lead Wipro, a  company with a rich heritage of technology and innovation  that is built on a foundation of ethics and responsibility.
I would like to thank our Chairman Azim Premji and the  Board of Directors for reposing confidence in me.
The  Company has bene/f_itted immensely from the leadership of  my predecessor, TK Kurien, and I thank him for building a  deep leadership bench that I can bene/f_it from coming in, and  executing one of the Company’s most seamless leadership  transitions.
The business world, in the recent past, has seen tremendous  technology led business disruptions.
One common  takeaway is that it is no longer about the product; it is  about the experience.
An example of this is how online cab  aggregators have changed the user experience of a cab  ride.
The innovations that make these experience happen  are disrupting the old order.
Winning in the new world thus  requires new business models, agile ways of working and a  fresh strategy, design and technology vision.
It is in the context of this business and technology  environment and market opportunity that we have set  out our vision, which is: “To earn our Clients’ trust and  maximize value of their businesses by providing solutions  that integrate deep industry insights, leading technologies  and best in class execution” .
Our ambition is to achieve $15 billion in revenues with  23% Operating Margins by 2020 in our IT Services business  segment.
While the ambition is aggressive, it is an aspiration  that your company’s leadership believes in.
It is making us  look at things diﬀerently, breaking away from the thinking  that constrained us and is yet grounded in reality – because  the opportunity for such growth exists in the market.
To deliver on this ambition, we have a sound strategy,  leveraging our strengths to diﬀerentiate in the market and  being relevant to our client’s current and future needs.
Our strategy is based on two themes – “Modernize the Core”  of our clients’ business (Run Strategy) and help our clients’  “Drive the Future” (Change Strategy) of their businesses.
Modernize the Core ( RUN) -  We will continue to drive  market share in our core businesses through the following  key themes: Integrated domain and technology services and solutions  (IT and Ops) across prioritized verticals, service lines and  geographies.
This is helping us deliver improved productivity  and eﬃciency gains to our clients and in turn, enhance  our footprint and wallet share within the client landscape  through cross-selling multiple services to provide an  integrated solution.
We are also investing in innovative  business models like BPaaS (business process as a service)  that integrates across IT Infrastructure, Application Platforms  and Business Operations and provides consumption based  pricing to our clients.
Simplification  of the client technology landscape by  elimination of legacy activities and hyper-automation  leveraging Wipro’s own IP , our cognitive intelligence platform  Wipro HOLMES TM as well as third party IP through our  alliances with various automation providers.
Over the last  12 months, we have implemented simpli/f_ication programs  and hyper automation across 42 existing clients and are able  to signi/f_icantly diﬀerentiate our proposition to new clients.
A key enabler to building capability and scale is working with  the larger Partner ecosystem viz.
M&A, start-ups, alliances,  academia and other strategic partnerships.
Over the last 12  months, we have established key engagement models with  our Partners and our clients are able to see the bene/f_it of such  a Partner eco-system enabling us to win and deliver complex  system integration and transformation engagements like  postal systems, airport maintenance and market utilities  within /f_inancial services and other industries.
Localization is key to respond to the current market demand  and socio-economic environment.
We are driving higher  localization in all key markets.
In 2015-16, we enhanced  our local presence in Continental Europe through the  acquisition of cellent AG.
Within US and UK, we are setting  up innovation and delivery centers in Atlanta, Dallas, New  York, Mountain View, London, Reading and Edinburgh.
We  continue to localize our workforce in all our key markets  through campus and lateral hiring as well as invest in delivery  centers in growth markets such as Latin America, Canada,  Africa, Middle East, Japan and Australia.
Drive the future ( CHANGE) - We will drive the CHAN GE  strategy through the following key themes: We are investing in building digital advisory, design,  technology and engineering capabilities with business and  IT stakeholders leveraging our investments in Designit and  Digital Pods.
Earlier this year, we integrated our Consulting  practive under our Digital practice.
This enables us (1) to  engage with the client’s business stakeholders and be in  the forefront of shaping tomorrow’s business models.
(2) to  generate consultative led demand in Digital  since selling  Digital is fundamentally diﬀerent from how traditional IT  services have historically been sold.
Our recent acquisition  of strategic design /f_irm Designit, remains at the core of this  strategy as this new approach completely  changes the way  CEO’S LETTER TO THE  STAKEHOLDERS  Wipro Limited 15 75 business processes to empower our employees and  increase their productivity.
We continue to make investments  aligned to our business imperatives to create a One Amazing  Wipro that has the speed of a startup.
We saw an example  of One Amazing Wipro at a time of the Chennai floods  which impacted our operations.
I want to thank the team in  Chennai and also at other locations for their commitment,  teamwork and customer orientation during the /f_loods last  month.
It was heartening to see our teams stretching well  beyond the call of duty- especially given that in many cases  their own homes and families were signi/f_icantly impacted.
While we focus on customer and revenue growth, I believe  that the only way to ensure business success is by making  our clients successful.
I have spent a lot of time meeting our  clients across the globe and personally understanding their  strategy, articulating our strategy and getting feedback.
I believe that what we are doing is extremely relevant to  our clients and our clients are looking to do business with  providers with a futuristic outlook like ours.
in 2015-16 our  net promoter score moved by over 400 basis points to one of  the highest in the industry, positioning us as an organization  strongly focused on client delivery and delight.
Within the /f_irst 100 days as CEO, I met over 70 of our top- 100 clients and key alliance partners across the globe.
I am  very encouraged by the trust and respect your company  commands from its clients and partners and the depth of the  relationships of our teams with their executives is enormous.
Given the depth of the leadership bench that I inherited,  within the first few weeks of the announcement of my  appointment as CEO, I communicated the new organization  structure and installed the leadership that I believe is the  right team to take your company forward.
Our approach  to leadership talent is primarily to source from within the  Company, where we have signi/f_icant talent.
We augment  this internal talent with external hiring.
The philosophy has  been to /f_irst look inside and provide opportunities to our  employees, before we go outside.
When we do go outside,  the endeavor is to get the best who can hit the ground  running.
Overall, I am very con/f_ident that we have the right strategy,  deep leadership bench, a talented and energized employee  base, support from our clients and partners.
I am fortunate  to have a very motivated, capable set of colleagues in  my leadership team committed to our values to build a  sustainable world class organization and motivated with a  sense of purpose – to maximize the value of the 39% of the  company that Mr. Premji has irrevocably transferred to the  Trust for the larger good of society.
I will take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders for  their continued support as we take your company to newer  heights in its journey towards excellence.
Sincerely, Abidali Z Neemuchwala we engage with our client stakeholders in transforming their  business.
A great example of this is the recent wins we have  had in key clients in the banking and consumer space where  Wipro was named the clients’ Digital partner.

M&A continues to be a key lever to acquire strategic assets  to accelerate execution of our strategy.
We announced 4  acquisitions and closed 3 within FY16.
These acquisitions  have already started showing early signs of success.
We  invested in acquiring HealthPlan Services, a business with  market-leading technology platforms and a fully integrated  Business Process as a Service solution to Health Insurance  companies globally apart from cellent A G and Designit.
Our investments in innovative companies through Wipro  Ventures allow us to tap innovation early.
We have made 6  such investments with a committed spend of $20 million in  the areas of Big Data & Analytics, AI, the IoT and Security.
Our  H2/H3 programs organically incubate capabilities, solutions  and platforms in emerging areas.
In FY16, we funded 13  such areas.
The key to a successful strategy is disciplined execution.
The  execution of the strategy is monitored through the strategy  and execution oﬃce.
We have de/f_ined various input and  outcome markers which are internally published monthly  for the leadership to ensure that all aspects of our strategic  priorities are being executed with rigor.
Finance, HR and People Transformation, M&A and Marketing  act as the key enablers for the execution of our strategy.
We  have identi/f_ied 23 key client themes on technology and  business and named 23 key leaders across the Company  to lead these client themes cutting across traditional  organizational structure to transform the organization  towards the new, while we continue to focus on delivering  the current without distraction.
The leadership teams  are collaboratively working together and are aligning to  the concept of One Amazing Wipro where we are able  to bring to our clients and employees, the power of the  entire organization in a uni/f_ied way opening tremendous  opportunities to bring value.
Enterprise transformations of the magnitude your company  is undergoing, need intervention programs focused on  behavior and new ways of working.

24 Annual Report 2015-16 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS  /hyphen.cap AN INTEGRATED APPROACH Wipro Limited 25 AN INTEGRATED APPROACH Businesses operate in a complex and ever changing  environment.
This environment is in/f_luenced by many  macro-economic factors, rapid technology developments,  dynamic stakeholder requirements and various context driven  environmental and social conditions.
Traditionally, corporate  annual reports focus on /f_inancial performance and statutory  requirements.
An Integrated Report incorporates /f_inancial and  non-/f_inancial information – governance, environmental and  social - in a manner that can help stakeholders understand how  a company creates and sustains value over the long-term.
This report  is an attempt to align to the principles of  International Integrated Reporting Framework developed by  The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which is  a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard  setters, the accounting profession and N GOs promoting  communication about value creation as the next step in the  evolution of corporate reporting.
The  Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework  establishes the  Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the  overall content of an integrated report.
The Guiding Principles  that underpin the preparation of an integrated report and  in/f_luencing the content of the report are strategic focus and  future orientation, connectivity of information, stakeholder  relationships, materiality, conciseness, reliability and  completeness, consistency and comparability.
The content  elements expected of an Integrated Report are organizational  overview and external environment, governance, business  model, risks and opportunities, strategy and resource allocation,  FINANCIAL CAPITAL NATURAL CAPITAL INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL HUMAN CAPITAL Financial capital enables investment in innovation leading to IP Capabilities and efforts of workforce  creates intellectual capital Nonlinear revenues create financial value Investing in  environmental management programs (Renewables,  energy efficiency,  water and waste management) Natural capital  (land use, energy and  water consumption) in  operations and supply  chain supports financial  value creation Partners (suppliers,  alliances) and investors  enable financial capital  exchanges SOCIAL &  RELATIONSHIP  CAPITAL Investment in people through retention, training and development Create financial capital  through customer  satisfaction, new business  and retained customers Deployment of skilled  workforce for customer  projects Investors CustomersSuppliers EXAMPLES OF  INTERRELATIONSHIPS  BETWEEN CAPITALS Note: : Education and community initiatives are  an integral part of social capital with linkages  to other capitals.
It has a wider mandate and  is driven by our values and belief in being a  responsible corporate citizen.

INDUSTRY OVERVIE W IT Services Fast-evolving technology landscapes, dynamic economic  environments and the emergence of digital business has  created a need for enterprises to look for a partner to advise,  design and execute their technology transformation and  support programs.
Large multinational enterprises are  engaging global IT Services companies who can deliver high  quality service on a global scale and at competitive costs.
Over  the past two decades, with the emergence of the internet  and inexpensive connectivity, the global delivery model of  service delivery has risen to become the preferred model in  sourcing of IT services, business process services and research  and development services.
In this period, service providers  have gained technological expertise, domain competency  and delivery capability by either developing organically or  by acquiring companies with these competencies.
Large  multinational enterprises are engaging global IT Services  companies to deliver high quality service on a global scale and  at competitive costs.
Global IT service providers oﬀer a range of end to end software  development, digital services, IT business solutions, research  and development services, technology infrastructure services,  business process services, consulting and related support  functions.
According to the Strategic Review 2016 of the  National Association of Software and Service (“NASSCOM”)  (“the NASSCOM Report”) in FY16, IT export revenues, from  India grew by 12.3% in constant currency, to an estimated  $108 billion.
NASSCOM expects FY17 export growth rates to be  between 10% and 12%.
We believe the IT Services industry has  signi/f_icant growth potential.
In the last few years, enterprises around the world are  embracing the reality that digital transforms every aspect of  business.
Experiences, consumers, entire industries, business  models and ways of working are all rapidly and fundamentally  changing.
Recognition of these trends, combined with the  realization that enterprises may not be able keep up with  this pace of change, has a profound impact on our clients.
This requires new business models, new ways of working and  integrated capability across strategy, design and technology.
According to NASSCOM Perspective 2025: Shaping the Digital  Revolution the Indian technology and services industry is on  track to reach $200 billion to $225 billion in revenues by 2020,  from a base of $143 billion in 2016, and furthermore, to reach  revenues of $350 billion by 2025.
The digital transformation of  businesses provides opportunities for IT Services industry in  providing a range of new services.
IT Products  The key components of the hardware industry are servers,  desktop, notebook and tablet computers, storage devices,  peripherals, printers and networking equipment.
According  to the NASSCOM Report, the hardware segment of the IT- Business Process Management (“IT-BPM”) market in India is  estimated to be $13 billion in /f_iscal year 2016 or 25% of the  India IT-BPM industry including e-commerce.
According to the  NASSCOM report, the size of the hardware market in India has  been stagnant at $13 billion for the last two years.
Emergence  of cloud computing technologies is aﬀecting demand for IT  products like servers.
BUSINESS OVERVIE W We are one of the leading providers of IT services globally.
We combine the business knowledge and industry expertise  of our domain specialists and the technical knowledge  and implementation skills of our delivery team leveraging  our products, platforms, partnerships and solutions in our  development centers located around the world.
We develop and integrate innovative solutions that enable  our clients to leverage IT to achieve their business objectives  at competitive costs.
We use our quality processes and global  talent pool to deliver “time to development” advantages, cost  savings and productivity improvements.
Our IT Services business provides a range of IT and IT-enabled  services which include digital strategy advisory, customer  centric design, technology consulting, IT consulting, custom  Wipro Limited 27 application design, development, re-engineering and  maintenance, systems integration, package implementation,  global infrastructure services, analytics services, business  process services, research and development and hardware  and software design to leading enterprises worldwide.
The  markets we serve are undergoing rapid changes due to the  pace of developments in technology, innovation in business  models and changes in the sourcing strategies of clients.
Pressures on cost-competitiveness and an uncertain economic  environment are causing clients to develop newer business  models.
On the technology front, digital business has changed  the nature of demand for IT services.
Development of advanced  technologies such as cloud based oﬀerings, big data analytics,  mobile applications and the emergence of social media are  shifting the point of decision-making on IT sourcing within  clients’ organization from the traditional Chief Information  Oﬃcer to newer stakeholders such as Chief Marketing Oﬃcer,  Chief Digital Oﬃcer, Chief Risk Oﬃcer etc.
These trends on  newer business models, emerging technologies and sourcing  patterns provide us with signi/f_icant growth opportunities.
Our IT Products segment provides a range of third-party IT  products, which allows us to oﬀer comprehensive IT system  integration services.
These products include computing,  Platforms and Storage, Networking Solutions, Enterprise  Information Security, and software products, including  databases and operating systems.
We have a diverse range  of clients, primarily in the India and Middle East markets from  small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) to large enterprises in  all major industries.
BUSINESS STRATEGY Our  vision “To earn our Clients” trust and maximize value of  their businesses by providing solutions that integrate deep  industry insights, leading technologies and best in class  execution” .
Our ambition is to achieve $15 billion in revenue with 23%  Operating Margins by 2020 in our IT Services business segment.
Technology has become increasingly central and core  to enterprises across industry segments.
In addition,  consumerization of IT has led to blurring of boundaries  between business needs and technology enablement.
This  has led to clear separation of priorities and shifting ownership  between the Run side and the Change side of our clients’  businesses.
Our strategy thus addresses our clients’ Run and Change  agenda.
The Run Strategy is about Modernizing the Core of  our clients’ process and technology landscape i.e.
help clients  achieve signi/f_icant eﬃciencies in their core operations through  various levers in all of our core markets.
The Change Strategy  (i.e., Driving the Future) is focused on helping clients achieve  digital transformation enabled by ‘Digital Capabilities’ brought  by Wipro and its partner ecosystems.
1.
Integrated Services  Enterprises are looking for the right partner in helping them with  business outcomes.
Traditionally, IT services have evolved across  distinct set of services.
In recent times, the expectation from  vendors is to solve client’s business problem leveraging domain  knowledge and synergistic integration of multiple services.
The  emergence of ‘As a service’ consumption models is leading to a  market demand for delivery of integrated services e.g.
BPaaS  (Business Process as a Service).
We have set up dedicated Integrated Services and Solutions  Group (ISS G) with a mandate of integrating end-to-end  technology solutions from multiple service lines like Applications,  Infrastructure services and Analytics.
In integrating services to  solve customer’s business problems, the unit will consider  reference architectures, selection of tools and platform, cost  eﬀectiveness of solution and best practices.
An example is the  Managed File Transfer as a Service (MFTaaS) platform which is a  cloud oﬀering enabling large /f_ile transfers in organizations in a  secure manner.
The MFT platform has transformed B2B (business  to business) enterprise file transfers for global customers  including Fortune 500 customers.
2.
Simpli/f_ication Enterprises are focused on cost reduction with improved  quality of service and reliability, coupled with variable pricing  arrangements.
Wipro’s approach to achieve enterprise objectives  is to deliver simplification of client technology landscape  through consolidation, elimination and automation.
We are  building automation assets covering Application Development  and Management services.
Our aim is to oﬀer value added  solutions through portfolio rationalization, modernization,  cloud migration and SaaS / PaaS oﬀerings.
We focus on target  operating model with capabilities such as Cloud Ready AMS,  Crowd Sourced AMS, and Digital Ready AMS towers.
3.
Hyper-Automation Our focus is to help clients achieve their ‘Run’ goals through  signi/f_icant cost optimization in operations by deploying cutting  edge platforms and technologies that drive Hyper-automation  and achieve industrialization of service delivery.
Hyper automation is a focused initiative for us to drive, not  only the delivery productivity, but also the new way of work  as we see Cognitive and Robotic process automation (RPA)  drastically changing traditional IT delivery model.
In FY 2015- 2016 we have done successful Proof-of-Concept (PoC) in this  Integrated Services | Simplification Hyper-Automation | Alliances | Localization ‘RUN’ STRATEGY- Modernize the Core 28 Annual Report 2015-16 area across large clients.
In FY 2016-2017 we plan to do large  scale roll out across various archetypes, namely infrastructure  and application managed services, application development  and testing services.
We developed Wipro HOLMESTM, a Cognitive AI Platform with a  rich set of cognitive computing services based on open source  software.
It is focused towards solving key enterprise business  use cases by injecting cognition into IT and Business processes.
Wipro HOLMES TM enables development of various types of  AI applications like Intelligent Virtual Agents, Anticipatory  and Predictive Systems, Cognitive Process Automation, Visual  Computing and Human Computer Interface, Knowledge  Processing Systems.
The automation platform is backed by the  approach to deliver simpli/f_ication in IT and Operations landscape  through consolidation, elimination and automation.
4.
Alliances We have a dedicated unit to deepen and widen alliance  ecosystems to drive creation of new markets and solutions,  expand in key verticals/geographies and drive Go-To-Market  (GTM) outcomes.
We have classi/f_ied alliances as follows: •	 Strategic Alliances: Multiple product lines with  signi/f_icant business volume and potential.
•	 Growth Alliances: Single practice alliances.
•	 Niche Alliances: Niche products with diﬀerentiated  solutions.
5.
Localization Key geographies such as Continental Europe, Canada, Latin  America, Africa and Asia-Paci/f_ic region are emerging as areas of  growth for the IT services industry.
We believe that commitment  to these geographies is important in growing our business.
We are driving a higher localization in all our key markets.
In  Continental Europe, we enhanced our local presence through  acquisition of Cellent A G, an IT Services company serving  Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
The acquisition has stabilized  and the traction is positive.
We are enhancing local delivery  capability at multiple locations.
We are investing dedicated  eﬀorts in growth markets like Latin America, Canada and Africa.
We expect locals as a percentage of the workforce to increase as  we execute on this theme and diversity is a key strategic priority  as part of our globalization.
We are also taking many local initiatives in engaging with  the local industry, universities, community and entering into  partnerships with local entities.
6.
Digital and Advisory  With clients across industries driving adoption of Digital and  leading with Digital transformation, expectations from service  providers are to partner and enable organizations design,  strategize and partner in executing through the transformation  process.
In addition as Enterprises go ‘Digital’ , business  stakeholders are playing a key role in in/f_luencing and driving  technology decisions given the core role of Digital technologies  in enabling businesses go Digital.
Thus, as clients increasingly transform to become ‘Digital  providers’ of products and services, we continue to invest and  build capabilities in Digital Strategy, Design, Architecture and  Engineering.
These capabilities help Business and IT stakeholders  achieve Digital goals leveraging the breadth of talent at Wipro  across superior data analytics, engineering and design.
Our vision of the Digital business across advisory, design and  technology is securing mindshare amongst existing and new  customers.
We believe Consulting capabilities in Business and  IT Strategy, Functional and Process Excellence are critical to the  Advisory oﬀering in Digital along with design and technology  pillars.
With this in view, we have aligned our Consulting services  with the Digital unit to further boost the capabilities of both  units.
Our acquisition in the Digital and Strategic Design space, Design  it, has integrated well with our digital unit.
Harmonizing teams,  cultures and capabilities has created diﬀerentiated positioning in  the market for us.
Our clients are beginning to see the bene/f_it of  design and engineering working together to deliver remarkable  customer experiences at speed and at scale.
The joint GTM  is securing synergy deal wins for us.
For example, the design  capability combine d with our technology skills helped us win  a large digital engagement with a global bank.
In 2015-16, we launched a program to train approximately 10,000  professionals in digital technologies.
We are ramping up this  capability signi/f_icantly to cover another 20,000 professionals in  2016-17.
Our focus is to build high caliber teams covering high  end engineers, top end coders, digital architects, data scientists,  digitization consultants, service design experts, specialized  digital delivery practitioners, industry focused strategists  and solution experts.
Keeping in line with this priority, we  have launched the Digital Academy to train super specialized  engineering talent and are running specific enablement  programs to transform customer facing and delivery teams to be  ‘Digital’ ready.
We opened Digital pods in London and New York  to oﬀer enhanced transformation services to global customers.

Non-Linearity Given the need to address business challenges with speed and  to diﬀerentiate amongst service providers, we continue to drive  use of intellectual property to drive non-linearity in our business.
We have a significant thrust to drive non-linearity through  investments in Intellectual Property in the form of products (like  Gallagher, Opus, Healthplan Services (HPS), Promax, platforms  (like Wipro HOLMESTM), frameworks and solutions.
We have formed a dedicated unit to drive non-linear revenue  growth by leveraging IP based products, platforms and solutions  as well as through automation and innovative commercial  constructs and delivery models.
Wipro HOLMES TM continues to receive strong adoption with  18 engagements across diverse industry segments.
During the  year ended March 31, 2016, we successfully completed a pilot  engagement in deploying and implementing an e KYC Wipro  HOLMESTM solution in a Wall Street Bank.

World class Ecosystem Given the pace and scale of disruption in the technology  landscape, it is imperative to have a proactive and structured  approach to work with the innovation ecosystem.
Our ecosystem  strategy is de/f_ined around building and nurturing four types  of ecosystem plays through Start-ups, M&A, Consulting  partnerships and academia partnerships.
Start-up partnerships As part of a start-up engagement model, we have invested in  building a world class ecosystem through a US$ 100 million  corporate venture capital fund, Wipro Ventures, aimed at  investing in cutting edge start-ups in areas such as Digital,  Internet of  Things (IoT), Big data, Open source, Cybersecurity  and Arti/f_icial Intelligence (AI).
In 2015-16, Wipro Ventures has  seen strong traction and scale.
We have made 6 investments with  a cumulative spend of US$ 15 million and a further committed  spend of US$ 5 million in FY16 in start-ups working in Big Data  and Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things,  Mobility, Cloud Infra, Fintech and Security – technologies that  are reshaping the future of enterprises.
M&A Acquisitions are key enablers in building capability in industry  domain, emerging technology areas, Digital and increasing  market footprint in newer markets.
We focus on opportunities  where we can further develop our domain expertise, speci/f_ic  skill sets and our Global Delivery Model to maximize service  and product enhancements and higher margins.
We also use  our acquisition program to increase our presence in select  geographies, increase our footprint in certain large customers  and pursue select business opportunities.
Key acquisitions  consummated during the year ended March 31, 2016 are  Designit, Cellent and HPS.
Designit is a global strategic design /f_irm, helping businesses tap  into the opportunities in the digital age by turning technology  into meaningful experiences.
With an international team of  designers, strategists, and technologists across nine oﬃces  in Denmark, Germany, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Israel, Japan  and Brazil, Designit uses a strategic Design Process to design  uni/f_ied product-service experiences that bring end-user value,  business value and business transformation.
This acquisition will  complement the capabilities of an established design leader  with Wipro’s engineering heritage and bring compelling value  to the clients.
Designit’s expertise in experience-driven design  complements Wipro Digital’s capabilities in technology, digital  strategy, design, and digital architecture.
Together, the two  organizations become a comprehensive and scalable global  digital transformation partner to improve customer experience  while radically digitizing business operations.
Cellent is a leading IT consulting and software services company  oﬀering holistic innovative IT solutions and services in the DACH  region of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
HPS oﬀers market-leading technology platforms and a fully  integrated Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) solution to  Healthcare Insurance companies (Payers) in the individual, group  and ancillary markets.
The acquisition would be closely aligned  with Wipro’s key levers for growth, which is, to dominate the  services market through platform led or BPaaS oﬀerings.
Wipro  would gain the competitive, early mover advantage in the high  growth public and private exchange space for individual, group  and ancillary markets.
This would also strengthen Wipro’s Payer  portfolio with access to HPS’s Payer clientele.
During the year ended March 31, 2016, we also announced our  intent to acquire the Viteos Group.
Viteos Group service portfolio  includes shadow-accounting services, middle and back-oﬃce  outsourcing services.
This acquisition will expand Wipro’s capital  markets portfolio in fund accounting services and enhance  Wipro’s Business Process Services capabilities.
Consulting partnerships Clients are seeking to work with partners who can answer  strategic questions and execute on the mandate.
We are  exploring key partnerships in areas such as Digital that can  complement our strong capabilities in design, engineering and  technology.
Academia partnerships The objective of academia partnerships is to drive a research  oriented/futuristic technology research and capability build  aligned to academia objectives.
Our focus is to work with  academia in United States, Europe, Israel and India in the /f_ields  30 Annual Report 2015-16 of computer and electrical engineering.

While residents were struggling to stay dry and obtain essential supplies,  businesses were also severely impacted.
Our campuses (Sholinganallur, Guindy & Mahindra World city) were impacted.
Owing to priority on people safety, evacuation was /f_irst initiated and facilities were shut-down and Business Continuity Plans  were invoked for all critical customer services that were supported from Chennai.
Our teams across business units and functions worked in a well co-ordinated manner, demonstrating sense of exigency.
Many employees and contractors stretched beyond the call of duty and ensured that the continuity plans were well executed.
Customers also understood the situation and reciprocated appropriately.
Multiple business continuity arrangements like working environment for employees working on critical projects, special  boarding arrangements for over a thousand employees in our campuses, travel arrangement for  thousands of employees to  our facilities in other cities etc were made to ensure continuity of support to critical applications/processes.
Regular updates  to customers and employees helped obtain cooperation and support.
We express our gratitude to all involved for their dedication & perseverance.
It is a success story for us as employees,  contractors, vendors, partners and customers went beyond their call of duty to make Wipro a more safe and secure place.
While our teams have done a good job in recovering from Chennai deluge, we have taken several proactive steps as an  organization to prepare ourselves for similar crisis in future across locations.
A separate function to address Business Continuity  Planning has been formed and an enhanced Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) framework aligned to ISO  22301 (latest global industry standard) has been launched.
With this rollout, the accounts, service functions and locations  will have a comprehensive and integrated view of the BCM requirements and be able to plan, coordinate and execute the  strategies eﬀectively.
Wipro Cares, the community initiatives arm of Wipro, supported the victims of Chennai /f_loods in December 2015 by  collaborating with NGOs experienced in disaster relief operations and worked with the local government to help aﬀected  communities with particular focus on disadvantaged groups and those living near Wipro campuses.
The Ombudsprocess Wipro is committed to the highest standards of openness,  probity and accountability.
Having a robust whistleblower  policy that employees and other stakeholders can use without  fear or apprehension is a sine non qua for a transparent and  ethical company.
An important aspect of accountability and  transparency is a robust mechanism that allows partners,  customers, suppliers and other members of the public, to  voice concerns in a responsible and eﬀective manner.
What  this means in concrete terms is that whenever a stakeholder  discovers information that reveals serious malpractice,  impropriety, abuse or wrongdoing within the organization  then the stakeholder should be able to report without fear of  reprisal, anyone can report a concern to the ombudsperson  online at www.wiproombuds.com In 2015-16, 1,397 complaints were received via the  Ombudsprocess and the action taken cases as of March 31,  2016 was 1,337.
Based on self-disclosure data, 68% of these  were from employees and the balance were mainly anonymous  and from other stakeholders like vendors and customers.
The top categories of complaints were people processes  (38%) and workplace concerns and harassment (21%).
There  were no cases of child labor reported.
We have a policy and  framework for employees to report sexual harassment cases  at workplace and our process ensures complete anonymity  and con/f_identiality of information.
Adequate workshops  and awareness programme against sexual harassment are  conducted across the organization.
A total of 111 complaints  of sexual harassment were raised in the year 2015, of which 107  cases were disposed and appropriate actions were taken in all  cases within the statutory timelines.
38 Annual Report 2015-16 CAPITALS AND VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL CAPITAL* Assessment of Key Risks  •	 Global economic crisis: We derive approximately 53%  of our IT Services revenue from the Americas (including  the United States) and 25% of our IT Services revenue  from Europe.
If the economy in the Americas or Europe  continues to be volatile or conditions in the global /f_inancial  market deteriorate, pricing for our services may become  less attractive and our clients located in these geographies  may reduce or postpone their technology spending  *Financial data referred in this section in INR refers to data from the Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS.
We now introduce, in brief, a short explanation of the capitals, followed by Wipro’s approach to value creation  across these capitals.
Financial capital is broadly understood as the pool of funds available to an organization.
Financial capital also  serves as a medium of exchange that can obtain value through conversion into other forms of capital.
Intellectual capital  is broadly organizational, knowledge-based intangibles, including intellectual property, such  as patents, copyrights, software, rights and licences and “organizational capital” such as tacit knowledge, systems,  procedures and protocols Human capital is broadly people’s competencies, capabilities and experience, and their motivations to innovate  and support the organizations shared goals and values.
Social and relationship capital is broadly the institutions and the relationships within and between communities,  groups of stakeholders and other networks, and the ability to share information to enhance individual and collective  well-being such as customers, investors and suppliers.
Natural capital is broadly all renewable and nonrenewable environmental resources and processes that provide  goods or services that support the past, current or future prosperity of an organization.
It includes air, water, land,  minerals, forests, biodiversity and eco-system health.
Manufactured capital is broadly seen as human-created, production-oriented equipment and tools.
For the IT  services business, these are the /f_ixed assets like buildings, IT hardware and telecommunication equipment.
The  deployment of the capital is adequately represented in /f_inancial capital and through impacts to natural capital.
Hence this report does not cover manufactured capital separately.

Reduction in spending on IT services may  lower the demand for our services and negatively aﬀect  our revenues and pro/f_itability.
Our clients are concentrated  in certain key industries.
Any signi/f_icant decrease in the  growth of any one of these industries, or widespread  changes in any such industry, may reduce or alter the  demand for our services and adversely aﬀect our revenue  and profitability.
For instance, the continued softness  in global crude oil price has signi/f_icantly impacted the  companies operating in the energy industry, impacting  Wipro Limited 39 exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment  for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and  making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign  currencies.
The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign  exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash  /f_lows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings.
As of March 31, 2016, a Re.
1 increase/decrease in the spot  exchange rate of the Indian Rupee with the U.S. Dollar would  result in approximately Rs 1,398 million decrease/increase  in the fair value of our foreign currency dollar denominated  derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk:  Interest rate risk primarily arises from  /f_loating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other  lines of credit.
Our investments are primarily in short-term  investments, which do not expose us to signi/f_icant interest rate  risk.
To manage our net exposure to interest rate risk relating to  borrowings, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements,  which allows us to exchange periodic payments based on a  notional amount and agreed upon /f_ixed and /f_loating interest  rates.
As of March 31, 2016, substantially all of our borrowings  was subject to /f_loating interest rates, which reset at short  intervals.
If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps from  March 31, 2016, additional net annual interest expense on our  /f_loating rate borrowing would amount to approximately Rs.
1,102 million.
Credit risk: Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers  may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage  this, we periodically assess the /f_inancial reliability of customers,  taking into account the /f_inancial condition, current economic  trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts  receivable.
Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
No single  customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts  receivable as of March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively and  revenues for the year ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016,  respectively.
There is no signi/f_icant concentration of credit risk.
Counterparty risk:  Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk  on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and  money market contracts and credit risk on cash and time  deposits.
Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities in  India which are at least AA rated by Indian rating agencies.
Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering  into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks  or /f_inancial institutions with acceptable credit ratings.
Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained  within predetermined parameters.
There are limits on credit  exposure to any /f_inancial institution.
The limits are regularly  assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including  /f_inancial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.
The  counterparties are primarily banks and /f_inancial institutions  and the Company considers the risk of non-performance by  the counterparty as non-material.
revenue and pro/f_itability of our Energy, Natural Resources  and Utilities industry vertical.
•	 Taxation Risks: Our pro/f_its for the period earned from  providing services at client premises outside India are  subject to tax in the country where we perform the work.
Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can  be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the  extent that the same income is subject to taxation in India.
Currently, we bene/f_it from certain tax incentives under  Indian tax laws.
These tax incentives include a tax holiday  from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our  businesses operating from specially designated Special  Economic Zones (“SEZs”).
Changes to these incentives and  other exemptions we receive due to government policies  can impact our /f_inancial performance.
•	 Wage Pressure: Our wage costs in emerging markets have  historically been signi/f_icantly lower than wage costs in the  developed markets for comparably skilled professionals,  and this has been one of our competitive advantages.
However, wage increases in emerging markets may prevent  us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may  negatively affect our profit margins.
We may need to  increase the levels of our employee compensation more  rapidly than in the past to retain talent.
Unless we are able  to continue to increase the eﬃciency and productivity of  our employees over the long term, wage increases may  reduce our pro/f_it margins.
•	 General Market Risk: Market risk is the risk of loss of future  earnings, to fair values or to future cash /f_lows that may  result from a change in the price of a /f_inancial instrument.
The value of a /f_inancial instrument may change as a result  of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange  rates and other market changes that aﬀect market risk  sensitive instruments.
Market risk is attributable to all  market risk sensitive financial instruments including  investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and  loans and borrowings.
Our exposure to market risk is a function of investment and  borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in  foreign currency.
The objective of market risk management  is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to  losses.
Components of Market Risk Foreign currency risk: A signi/f_icant portion of our revenue is in  U.S.
Dollars, United Kingdom Pound Sterling, Euros, Australian  Dollars and Canadian Dollars while a large portion of our costs  are in Indian Rupees.
The exchange rates between the rupee  and these currencies have /f_luctuated signi/f_icantly in recent  years and may continue to /f_luctuate in the future.
Appreciation  of the Indian Rupee against these currencies can adversely  aﬀect our results of operations.
Consequently, the Company is  40 Annual Report 2015-16 Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk is de/f_ined as the risk that we will  not be able to settle or meet our obligations on time or at a  reasonable price.
Management monitors the Company’s net  liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of  expected cash /f_lows.
As of March 31, 2016, our cash and cash  equivalents are held with major banks and /f_inancial institutions.
Risk Management Procedures We manage market risk through a corporate treasury  department, which evaluates and exercises independent  control over the entire process of market risk management.
Our corporate treasury department recommends risk  management objectives and policies, which are approved  by senior management and Audit Committee.
The activities  of this department include management of cash resources,  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency  exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance  with market risk limits and policies.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy  and Results  We evaluate our foreign exchange rate exposure arising from  these transactions and enter into foreign currency derivative  instruments to mitigate such exposure.
We have a consistent hedging policy, designed to minimize  the impact of volatility in foreign exchange /f_luctuations on the  earnings and assets & liabilities.
We evaluate exchange rate  exposure arising from transactions and positions and enter  into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such  exposure.
We follow established risk management policies,  including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward /  option contracts to hedge forecasted cash /f_lows denominated  in foreign currency.
As per the policy, the total hedges shall be  50% to 100% of the next four quarters of in/f_lows in addition to  select long term contracts which are beyond one year in tenor.
Our net foreign exchange gains/ (losses) from continuing  operations for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 were  Rs.
3,637 million and Rs.
3,867 million respectively.
We have designated certain derivative instruments as cash  /f_low hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of  forecasted highly probable cash /f_lows.
We have also designated  foreign currency borrowings as hedges against respective net  investments in foreign operations.
Our Hedge Book as on March 31, 2016 stood at USD 2.8 billion  dollars.
Our foreign exchange gains/(losses), net, comprise of:  1.
Exchange diﬀerences arising from the translation or  settlement of transactions in foreign currency, except for  exchange diﬀerences on debt denominated in foreign  currency (which are reported within /f_inance expense, net); and  2.
The changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as  hedging derivatives and ineﬀective portions of the hedging  instruments.
For forward foreign exchange contracts which  are designated and eﬀective as cash /f_low hedges, the mark  to market gains and losses are deferred and reported as a  component of other comprehensive income in stockholder’s  equity and subsequently recorded in the income statement  when the hedged transactions occur, along with the hedged  items.
Please refer note 15 in ‘Consolidated Financial Statements  under IFRS’ for further details.
Internal control systems and their adequacy  We have presence across multiple countries, and a large  number of employees, suppliers and other partners collaborate  to provide solutions to our customer needs.
Robust internal  controls and scalable processes are imperative to manage this  global scale of operations.
The Management has  laid down internal /f_inancial controls to  be followed by the Company.
We have adopted policies and  procedures for ensuring the orderly and eﬃcient conduct of  the business, including adherence to the Company’s policies,  the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection  of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  /f_inancial disclosures.

Please see Note 29 of the ‘Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS’ for additional details.
Revenue: In FY 2015-16 our revenue increased by 9.1%.
This  was driven primarily by a 10.7% increase in revenue from our IT  Services segment and was oﬀset partially by a 12.6% decrease  in revenue from our IT Products segment.
The increase in  IT Services revenues was driven by volume growth in our  Healthcare and Life Sciences industry vertical, Retail, Consumer  Goods & Transportation industry vertical and Manufacturing &  Hitech industry vertical as well as depreciation of the Indian  rupee against the U.S. dollar.
Pro/f_itability: In absolute terms, cost of revenues increased  by 11% primarily on account of increases in employee  compensation due to impact of rupee depreciation, salary  increases, stock compensation awarded, increase in headcount  during the year (including increase through business  combinations), and increase in subcontracting/technical fees,  which was partially oﬀset by reduction in cost of hardware and  software.
As a result of the foregoing factors, our gross pro/f_it as  percentage of our total revenue decreased by 119 basis points  (bps).
Selling and Marketing Expenses:  Our selling and marketing  expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased marginally  from 6.5% for the year ended March 31, 2015 to 6.6% for the  year ended March 31, 2016.
In absolute terms, selling and  marketing expenses increased by 11.3%, primarily on account  of increases in employee compensation due to impact of rupee  depreciation, salary increases, stock compensation awarded,  increase in headcount during the year, advertisement and  brand building expenses, depreciation and amortization and  travel expenses arising from intangible assets recognized  through business combinations.
General and Administrative Expenses:  Our general and  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased  marginally from 5.46% for the year ended March 31, 2015 to  5.51% for the year ended March 31, 2016.
In absolute terms,  general and administrative expenses increased by 10.1%,  primarily due to increases in employee compensation,  provision for doubtful debts, facility expenses and legal and  professional fees.
Results from Operations: As a result of the foregoing factors,  our operating income increased by 1.7%, from Rs 95,423  million for the year ended March 31, 2015 to Rs 97,021 million   for the year ended March 31, 2016.
However, our results from  operating activities as a percentage of revenue (operating  margin) decreased by 138 bps from 20.2% to 18.8%.
Finance Expenses:  Our /f_inance expenses increased from Rs  3,599 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 to Rs 5,582  million for the year ended March 31, 2016.
This increase is  primarily due to an increase of Rs 1,341 million in exchange  loss on foreign currency borrowings and related derivative  instruments as well as an increase in interest expense by Rs 642  million on account of increased borrowings during the year  ended March 31, 2016.

Interest and dividend income increased by Rs 4,723 million  while gain on sale of investments decreased by Rs 1,302 million  during the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the year  ended March 31, 2015.
This net increase was due to an increase  in cash available for investments due to enhanced cash /f_lows.
Taxes: Our income taxes increased by Rs 681 million from Rs  24,624 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 to Rs 25,305  million for the year ended March 31, 2016.

In  absolute terms in INR, we experienced growth across most  IT Services industry verticals, particularly in Healthcare and  Life Sciences industry vertical, Retail, Consumer Goods &  Transportation industry vertical and Manufacturing & Hitech  industry vertical.
In terms of USD revenues, the growth was  3.7%.
In terms of USD, expressed in constant currency, the  growth was 7.6%.
In our IT Services segment, we added 261  new customers during  the year ended March 31, 2016 across  all industry verticals including customers added on account  of acquisitions.
Revenue from Product Engineering, Global  Infrastructure Services, Business Process Services and Analytics  grew strongly during the year.
Amongst geographic segments,  India and Middle East business and Americas regions showed  strong growth.
During the year, we saw signi/f_icant softness in the Oil & Gas  business due to the impact of low oil prices, which aﬀected our  revenue growth in US dollar.
However, in absolute terms in INR,  we experienced growth across all IT Services industry verticals.
Pro/f_itability: Our gross pro/f_it as a percentage of our revenue  from our IT Services segment decreased by 163 bps.
The  decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue is primarily  attributable to an increase in employee compensation cost  during the year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to year  ended March 31, 2015 as part of our annual compensation  review and annual progression cycle, partially oﬀset by the  depreciation in the value of the Indian rupee against foreign  currency.
Wipro Limited 43 Selling and Marketing Expenses:  Selling and marketing  expenses as a percentage of revenue from our IT Services  segment increased from 6.37% for the year ended March  31, 2015 to 6.45 % for the year ended March 31, 2016.
In  absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses increased  Rs 3,366 million.
This increase is primarily attributable to an  increase in the employee compensation cost due to increased  compensation as part of our annual compensation review  and annual progression cycle and investments in manpower  capacity and amortization of intangibles acquired through  business combinations.
General and Administrative Expenses: General and  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from  our IT Services segment decreased from 5.68% for the year  ended March 31, 2015 to 5.57% for the year ended March 31,  2016.
In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses  increased Rs 2,146 million.
This increase is primarily due to an  increase in the employee compensation cost due to increased  compensation as part of our annual compensation review and  annual progression cycle.
Segment Results:  As a result of the above, segment results  as a percentage of our revenue from our IT Services segment  decreased by 172 bps.
However, in absolute terms, the segment  results of our IT Services segment increased by 2.12%.
Performance against Guidance: Historically, we have  followed a practice of providing revenue guidance for our  largest business segment, namely, IT Services.
The guidance  is provided at the release of every quarterly earnings when  revenue outlook for the succeeding quarter is shared.

Revenue: Our revenue from the IT Products segment decreased  by 12.60%.

Our borrowings  have increased primarily on account of bridge loans to /f_inance  our acquisitions of Cellent and HPS.
This increase is partly  oﬀset by increase in payment of dividend amounting to Rs  6,004 million.
Dividends paid in the year ended March 31, 2016  represents /f_inal dividend declared for the year ended March 31,  2015 amounting to Rs 7 per share and interim dividend for the  year March 31, 2016 amounting to Rs 5 per share.
Shareholder Returns Dividend:  For the /f_iscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Board  of Directors declared an interim dividend of Re 5 per share and  recommended a /f_inal dividend of Re 1 per share, for a total  dividend for the year of Re 6 per share.
The recommended /f_inal dividend is subject to the approval  of shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting, and if  approved, would result in a cash out/f_low of approximately Rs  2,974 million, including corporate dividend tax thereon.
On April 20, 2016, we announced our intention to conduct a  buyback of equity shares through a tender oﬀer (the “Tender  Oﬀer”) in order to distribute returns to the equity shareholders.
Under the Tender Oﬀer, we will buy back up to 40 million equity  shares of Rs 2 each (representing 1.62% of total equity capital)  from the shareholders of the company on a proportionate basis.
The buyback price will be Rs 625 per equity share payable in  cash for an aggregate amount not exceeding Rs 25,000 million.
After maintaining a steady dividend payout ratio of 30%, 33%  and 31% for the years 2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12, we had,  considering the needs of liquidity and strategic requirements,  enhanced the dividend payout ratio in 2014-15 to 41%.
For the /f_iscal year ended March 31, 2016, the payout ratio,  computed by combining the interim dividend, the proposed  /f_inal dividend (including the dividend distribution tax) and  the aforementioned buyback will be 48%, an increase of  approximately 7% from the payout ratio for the previous year.

Focused initiatives through these programs  have  led to higher engagement and retention levels.
D)  Careers & Capability Based on the evolution of technology and customer/market  dynamics, our learning and development (L & D) function  launched multiple programs to upskill/reskill employees in  technical as well as behavioral competencies.
Employees  built their capabilities through e-learning modules, expert  and peer learning, project trainings, webinar participation,  outbound trainings, on-job learnings & mentoring.

The L&D team works with the  business teams to identify the gap in the skills of the employee.
Just In Time training is provided to address skill gaps so that the  employee can then be deployed in new project opportunities.
This initiative aligns training to the business demand and helps  in rapidly ful/f_illing customer requirements.
For a number of our capability building programs, Yammer has  been used extensively for social learning.
For example, groups  have been created focusing on speci/f_ic technologies/roles in the  organization, where employees can come together to eﬀectively  learn from each other.
After classroom training, the faculty use  this platform to engage with the participants for continued  learning.
The discussions are analyzed to derive feedback which  enables L&D to improve training programs.
To generate interest,  we launched a competition across the various groups in Yammer  on how they could use the social media platform eﬀectively  50 Annual Report 2015-16 for learning.
The groups were measured on the number of  discussion threads and responses, as well as the quality of the  posts.

Customer stewardship hinges on  meeting customer expectations by being responsive to the  emerging trends and offering a portfolio of products and  services which integrate resource eﬃciency, dematerialization,  organizational transparency, connectedness and collaboration-  to meet changing customer needs.
Customer engagement is  critical to meet customer expectations and engagement is the  foundation on which stewardship rests.
Engaging better with  customers improves customer retention.
According to a research conducted by Harvard Business School,  a 5% increase in customer retention can result in a pro/f_it increase  of 25% to 95%, depending on the industry.
The key to retaining  customers is building strong relationships with them and this  requires prolonged and sustained customer engagement.
Eﬀorts  towards customer engagement are justi/f_ied by the lifetime  value (LTV) of the retained customer.
A retained customer is  cost eﬀective as it will require comparatively less service, at the  same time providing more business.
It is revenue enhancing as  52 Annual Report 2015-16 a satis/f_ied customer may contribute to customer acquisition by  providing positive referrals.

The program is driven more by responsible engagement and  commitment as informed by our values.
Our Code of Business  Conduct which provides the ethical guidelines and expectations  for conducting business directs Wipro’s relationship with its  suppliers and is applicable to all suppliers, agents, service  providers, channel partners, dealers, distributors and vendors  (“Suppliers”).
In the reporting year, the procurement leadership and Chief Risk  Oﬃce took up the Initiative of meeting suppliers across three  locations - Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad.
The Team has covered  signi/f_icant numbers of suppliers in the Facilities management  category.
This initiative is taken up with primary objective of  meeting all the supplier to ensure they follow the risk and  compliance processes and statutory guidelines adherence to  support  compliance with Wipro’s supplier code of conduct.
A  dedicated vendor helpdesk handles supplier queries on payment  issues, policy clari/f_ications and provides the initial contact for  grievance redressal.
Our approach to engagement is multi-pronged and the focus  is to improve the capabilities of suppliers in managing their  sustainability performance.
The approach is represented below: A signi/f_icant feature of our engagement is how we align our  community or CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) programs  with supplier engagement wherever it is possible.
This can  address some of the fundamental issues at hand – our bridge  program in education for children of migrant laborers for our new  infrastructure projects and city municipal solid waste workers are  some examples of areas of engagement in Bengaluru.
Various strands of our Supply Chain Sustainability program: 1.
Risk assessment or materiality study of our supply chain  – Trucost (UK), Fronesys (U K) and Supply Chain audits of  key support services by DNV has helped us identify and  prioritize supply chain areas for engagement 2.

Wipro-earthian Wipro-earthian is Wipro’s Sustainability Education Program  which seeks to support and drive sustainability thinking and  action through the learning process in school and colleges  across India.
The program completed 5 years in 2015.
In 2015- 16, we saw very enthusiastic response re/f_lecting in a massive  increase in participation numbers, outreach and representation.
We achieved wide geographical representation in 21 states,  45 districts and increased our reach to 2,000 schools, 1,500  colleges and 2,200 teachers.
This was achieved by developing  new partnerships with 6 state government bodies and 3 civil  society organizations who played a key role in ground outreach.
Our cumulative outreach was more than 10,000 educational  institutes via social media and other digital channels.
Fiscal  year 2015-16 saw the program being translated to 4 languages  and our total submissions have crossed 1,300 which is a 3- fold  increase and the highest ever.
Nine college and 12 school teams  selected as winners by national jury and felicitated by Mr. Azim  Premji at the annual Wipro-earthian awards.
The Continuous Engagement Program (CEP) program aims  promote integrated sustainability education in schools and  colleges and to co-create educational practices within institutions  that leads to sustainability action and thinking.
In colleges CEP  was driven by a few key initiatives such as our Sustainability  Internship program where we facilitated a diverse range of  sustainability internship opportunities through our partner  ecosystem for 10 students from 6 winning colleges.
As a /f_irst,  2015 also saw the launch of the Wipro-earthian Sustainability  quiz where we successfully ran quizzes at the Indian Institute of  Management (IIM) Ahmedabad Con/f_luence festival and the IIM  Bangalore Exemius festival where 227 teams and 681 students  participated.
Two noteworthy initiatives were the launch of  the Wipro Sustainability Fellowships at IIM Bangalore as well  as the co-curation of a round table discussion on sustainability  education which was attended by 60 regional colleges in Orissa.
As a part of our strategic collaboration with XUB, Bhubaneshwar  we also facilitated a one month sustainability discovery program  across India for 6 students from the P G program at the Xavier  School of Sustainability.
The CEP program in schools focused  on curricular intervention- where we developed a unique  sustainability curriculum for Wipro-earthian schools which is  being piloted in 9 schools across India.
Wipro Science Education Fellowship Program  in the U.S.A. We started a signi/f_icant program in school education in 2013  in the U.S.A.
While the expenditure associated with this may  not be allowable as CSR as per the Companies Act 2013, this  is an integral part of our global CSR strategy and therefore  something that merits disclosure.
The program is currently  running in Chicago, New Jersey, New York and Boston.
We  are partnering with University of Massachusetts, Boston and  Michigan State University.
Mercy College in New York and  Montclair State University in New Jersey are also involved.
The  program works in close collaboration in over 20 school districts  wherein 250-350 teachers go through a 2 year fellowship with  intense support to develop their capacities to be better teachers  and change leaders.
The district administrators are a part of the  program.
We intend to expand these programs to other cities  in future.
The current commitment of Wipro to these programs  is about USD 7.8 million over a period of 5 years.
This is a large  and substantial commitment to improving science and math in  school education, one of the largest such commitments made  by a non US company.

Community Care Wipro Cares Wipro Cares is a not-for-profit trust that engages with our  proximate communities on the issues of Education for the  Underprivileged, Primary Health-Care and Environment.
In  addition, the trust also works on long-term rehabilitation of  aﬀected communities after natural disasters.
Wipro matches 1:1 all monetary contributions made by  employees to Wipro Cares.
The number of employee contributors  stands at more than 51,000, possibly making this the largest such  example in India and the world.
Key Updates of 2015-16: Education: The education projects continued to provide  educational opportunities to underprivileged children, typically  children who are most marginalized due to their socio-economic  status, for example children of migrant laborers.
More than  65,000 children bene/f_ited from the sixteen education projects  in the cities of Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Dimapur,  Bangalore, Delhi and Chennai.
These projects support and  enable children to stay in school through remedial education,  nutrition, drinking water facility, health check-ups and solar  heating-lighting facilities.
We also expanded into the North-East  speci/f_ically targeting children of migrant labourers through non- formal education and thereby mainstreaming these children  into formal education.
Disability: We have 12 projects through which we are currently  supporting the educational and rehabilitative needs of over  2,500 underprivileged children with disabilities in the cities of  Bengaluru, Pune, Jaipur, Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad.
A wide range of disabilities were covered, including Visual,  Speech & Hearing, Locomotor, Intellectual and Developmental  disabilities.
Under disability, our focus is on early intervention  and inclusive education to ensure that children with disabilities  have access to quality education and the opportunity to lead a  life of dignity.
Many projects also include capacity building of  families and communities to identify and manage disability at  an early stage.
Primary Healthcare: Our primary health care projects, in  partnership with N GOs, typically provide quality preventive  and curative health care services to underserved communities.
Through two of our health care projects, covering 60 villages  across Maharashtra & Nagaland we are providing more than  30,000 people access to primary health care.
Apart from  providing regular curative services, we are augmenting the  existing state infrastructure, training ASHA workers and building  capacity of local groups and thus providing health care services  in hard-to-reach remote villages to tribal communities as well  as generating awareness on health rights.
Environment: We are working on providing social and nutrition  security to about 2,000 waste workers in Bangalore, through a  solid waste management project, along with upgrading their  skills to assist them in augmenting their livelihood and live a  life of dignity.
This project has further been scaled up to focus  on providing waste pickers the access to social, nutritional, and  health security.
Wipro Limited 57 Disaster Rehabilitation:  Wipro Cares focuses on long term  rehabilitation of the affected communities after a natural  disaster.
We do this because we think that any kind of natural  calamity usually aﬀects the social fabric of the community and  it is important for us to address that impact.
In 2015-16, we  continued support to communities aﬀected by the Uttarakhand  Floods and initiated a project to work with 1,000 families  on exploring alternative modes of livelihood to reduce their  economic dependence on tourism and increase their resilience  as a community.
Wipro Cares also supported the victims of  Chennai /f_loods in December 2015 by collaborating with NGOs  experienced in disaster relief operations and worked with the  local government to help aﬀected communities with particular  focus on disadvantaged groups and those living near Wipro  campuses.
In Philippines we initiated two projects for underprivileged  and disaster-affected communities in partnership with  International Care Ministries (ICM) and World Wildlife Fund  (WWF) to address key developmental issues of the underserved  and underprivileged communities in the country by building  capacity of local groups through Health lessons that cover a  wide curriculum that ranges from nutrition, disease prevention,  to proper sanitation; and Livelihood classes to equip participants  with diﬀerent backyard small businesses to earn a living within  their immediate community.
Employee Engagement:   More than 51,000 Wiproites  contributed monetarily to Wipro Cares, making this possibly  the largest such initiative in India and one of the largest in  the world.
Employee volunteering eﬀorts doubled with over  7,703 employees (globally) engaged in voluntary activities  contributing to 14,434 hours in 2015-16.
We organized various  volunteering events and encouraged employees to volunteer  with our partners, acting thus as catalysts in bringing about  positive change and also learning in the process.
We currently  have 25 volunteering chapters, 13 in India and 12 overseas.
Employees are keen participants in the ongoing causes such as  education for underprivileged children, children with disabilities,  biodiversity and environment, animal care, old age home, and  feeding the poor and homeless, amongst others causes.
We also  have employees join volunteering eﬀorts across Asia Paci/f_ic,  Japan, USA, Philippines, Romania and Continental Europe.

ECOLOGICAL SU STAINABILITY  /parenleft.capNATURAL CAPITAL/parenright.cap Ecological sustainability is a cornerstone of our charter on  natural capital stewardship.
Our approach is built on the pillars  of Energy and Green House Gases ( GHG) mitigation, Water  58 Annual Report 2015-16 eﬃciency and Responsible Water management, Pollution and  Waste management and Biodiversity.
The increasing centrality of issues like climate change and water  stress in the last few years has led organizations to look beyond  their boundaries.
While internal business drivers like  resource  eﬃciency, waste management and  pollution mitigation have  been the primary levers of any corporate  environmental  program for many now, organizations have come to realize that  in order to make a real impact at a larger, systemic level, one can  no longer ignore the externalized costs of ecological damage.
At Wipro, our community programs on water and waste are two  examples of such interventions.

Management system Our programs and management systems are pivoted and derived  from the Ecological Sustainability Commitment, available at  http://wipro.org/resource/Ecological_Sustainability_Policy.
pdf .
We have been following the guidelines of the ISO  14001 framework for more than a decade now as one of the  cornerstones of our Environmental Management System (EMS).
18 of our campus sites in India and 2 in Australia are certi/f_ied to  the standards of ISO 14001:2004.
Energy Eﬃciency & GHG Mitigation In our set of goals which ended in 2015, we aimed to reduce our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 people-based emissions intensity /f_igures  by half from the 2010 baseline.
This /f_inancial year, we undertook  a target setting exercise to propose targets running from the  2015-16 to 2019-20.
Over the last couple of years, diﬀerent  frameworks have evolved for setting GERTs ( GHG Emissions  Reduction Target).
Once such framework is the science based  target setting from WRI (World Resource Institute) that tries to  align itself with the 2 degree imperative i.e.
global emissions by  2050 to be 20% of 1990 levels so as to stay within the threshold  of 2 degree rise in average surface temperature.
While we have studied and incorporated the WRI framework  to the extent that is relevant, our methodology has also been  driven by empirical considerations that are more pertinent to  the IT industry sector and to India.
We have adopted targets for  2025 and 2030 also and these will be revisited at the next target  review exercise in 2020.
Energy and GHG Emissions Goals: 1.
Absolute Scope 1+2 GHG emissions - Absolute emissions  reduction of around 35000 tons.
2.
Energy Intensity in terms of EPI - Cumulative reduction of  11% in EPI over 5 years 3.
Scope 1+2 GHG emission intensity on Floor Area (FAR) basis  - Cumulative reduction of 33 % in GHG intensity from 140  Kg / Sq.
Mt (kpsm) to 94 kpsm of CO –eq 4.
Renewable Energy - Doubling renewable energy  procurement of 65 Million units as on 2014-15 to a target  of 135 Million units in 2019-20.
For Energy Efficiency, in line with industry standards, we  are shifting from ‘Per Employee’ based metrics to Floor Area  (FAR) based metrics.
The accepted standard is EPI or Energy  Performance Indicator which is equivalent to Energy Per Unit  of Floor Area for a de/f_ined number of working hours per day.
We have deliberately not set a Carbon Neutral goal or an oﬀset  program for reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions due to the  externalities involved in most alternatives like embedded carbon  and water footprint, land use change and broader ecological  and social sustainability issues involved in such programs.
For  example, mass aﬀorestation of a single species over a large  area may help achieve a carbon reduction goal but have a  high negative impact on water sustainability, biodiversity and  livelihoods.
Energy Consumption: The total energy consumption, electricity  and back-up diesel generated, for oﬃce spaces across all global  operations in IT is 322 Mn Units (India adds to 299 Mn units).
Data centers, India and overseas (USA and Germany) contribute  to another 92 Mn units.
Office Space Energy Metrics : Energy efficiency measures  contributed to a 3.7% decrease in oﬃce space energy intensity  from 195 to 189 units per sq.
meter per annum.
This is primarily  from energy optimization measures, retro/f_it of older equipment  with more energy eﬃcient equipment and consolidation of  operations accompanied by a transition from leased to owned  facilities with the resulting increase in overall utilization of oﬃce  space and better quality of maintenance operations.
Emissions Intensity: Our India oﬃce space emissions intensity  (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 116 Kg Co2 eq.
per Sq.
Mt.
per annum,  a decrease of 10.8% from last year.
Absolute Emissions: The dashboard in page no.
59 provides a  summary of our Global and India GHG emissions for Oﬃce spaces  – from Scope 1 (emission from direct energy consumption, like  fuel) and Scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity).
The  /f_igures are net emissions for all years, after considering zero  emissions for renewable energy procured.
The absolute Scope  1 and 2 emissions for 2015-16 has decreased by around 5%  primarily due to higher share of renewable energy procurement.
GHG M itigation: Our five year GHG mitigation consists of  three key elements – Energy Eﬃciency, Renewable Energy (RE)  Purchase and Captive RE; of this, RE procurement will contribute  the maximum, 80% share to GHG emission mitigation strategy.
Wipro Limited 59 like us has been through direct power purchase agreement  from producers in select states.
Each state in India has its  own mechanism on eﬀecting access to open access- either  due to distribution company’s /f_inances or infrastructure not  being in place to enable large scale evacuation and storage  of renewable power.
This has led to a gap in meeting our  renewables targets.
It can be said that it will take a few  years before the market matures.
In order to avoid double  accounting, we have taken adequate steps by including  non-tradability of Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)  for contracted power through contracts and including  veri/f_ication of generation in the regulators national REC  registry.
•	 Captive	RE :  The pilot rooftop Solar PV installations at 3  of our campuses followed by extensive use of solar water  heaters in our guest blocks and cafeterias have resulted in  equivalent savings of 1.3 Mn units of grid electricity.
Scope 3 Emissions: A summary of our Scope 3 emissions  (other indirect sources) is provided below.
Out of the 15  categories of scope 3 reporting as per the new GHG corporate  value chain standard, we are presently reporting on all of the 8  applicable categories.
The Scope 3 graph only includes emissions from Business  Travel, Commute, Waste and Logistics to enable year on year  comparison •	 Energy Eﬃciency: Over the preceding /f_ive year period,  we have implemented a variety of energy eﬃciency  measures.
We were one of the early adopters of Green  Building Design with 18 of our current buildings certi/f_ied  to the international LEED standard (Silver, Gold, and  Platinum).
Since 2007, we have been working on a server  rationalization and virtualization program, through  which we have decommissioned old physical servers  and replaced the processing capacity with virtualization  technology on fewer numbers of servers.
As of March  2016, we have 2088 virtual servers running on 147  physical servers – contributing to an energy savings of  approximately 9 Million units annually, an increase of 3%  over the previous year.
•	 RE	procurement:  For the reporting period of 2015- 16, we procured 75 Mn units of Renewable energy  through PPAs (Power Purchase agreements) with private  producers, which contributed to approximately 23% of  our total India energy consumption.
However this fell  short of our target of 82 Mn units for the reporting year.
The mainstay of accessing RE for open access consumers  270,000 260,000 250,000 240,000 230,000 220,000 2013-14 Global 256,244 244,444 269,117 254,072 253,640 242,062 India 2014-15 2015-16 GHG Scope 1 and 2  (Tons of CO2 eq.)

60 Annual Report 2015-16 The overall emissions across all scopes is 672,502 tons.
This does not include conveyance claims and some other  minor scope 3 heads.
Within this, the three big contributors  to our GHG emissions are: Electricity – Purchased and  Generated (32%), Business Travel (26%), Employee Commute  (15%) and Upstream fuel and energy emissions (15%).
Business Travel: The IT services outsourcing model require  frequent travel to customer locations, mainly overseas, across  the delivery life cycle and contributes to around a quarter of  our overall emissions footprint.
This includes air, bus, train,  local conveyance and hotel stays.
Policies on usage of diﬀerent  modes of travel based on distance and time taken, need  and budget-based travel approval and increasing focus on   processes which enable remote working and collaboration  are some of the cost and process optimization measures  implemented over past few years.
Employee Commute : Employees have various choices for  commuting informed primarily by distance, /f_lexibility, work  timings, costs, city infrastructure and connectivity in the case  of group or public transport.
In addition to company arranged  transport (37%), employees utilize public transport (~-45%),  with owned cars and two wheelers accounting for the balance.
Over the past few years, we have taken steps to facilitate a shift  towards improved access to public transport for employees  (buses, commuter trains), carpooling, apart from encouraging  cycling to work through an active cycling community in the  organization.
IT led soft infrastructure enablers like anytime direct  connectivity access to oﬃce intranet applications, secure  personal device connectivity through the BYOD initiative  (Bring Your Own Devices) are steps in enabling more /f_lexible  work place options.
Collaborative engagements: As a member of the Indo-US joint research program - the Solar  Energy Research I nstitute for India and the United States  (SERIIUS), we are supporting a long term program “Design  and development of smart micro-grid technologies for large  scale decentralized solar power applications in Indian villages  - The Zero Energy Village concept” .
As a member of the TERI- BCSD (Business Council for Sustainable Development) India  program, we participated in the program track on Energy  Eﬃciency that seeks to advance best practices on energy  management and eﬃciency in diﬀerent industry sectors We also  coordinated the CEO forum on Climate C hange as  part of COP-21 in Paris and our CEO was one of the co-authors  of an article on climate change.
We are signatories to the Paris  Pledge on Carbon Emissions  through the World Economic  Forum.
Water Eﬃciency and Responsible Use At Wipro, we view water from the three inter-related lens of  Conservation, Responsibility and Security; our articulated  goals are therefore predicated on these three dimensions.
The table below shows the applicability and across our operations for the major Scope 3 categories.
Scope 3  Emissions  Category Applicability Current Reporting, Coverage within IT business Upstream scope 3 emissions Purchased goods and services Capital Goods Yes Based on purchase ledger for 2014-15 and application of econometric input- output model for diﬀerent categories and business activities: 38,416 tons of CO2  equivalent.

Upstream transportation and  distribution Yes Not Reported, as not material Waste generated in operations Yes For India operations, which represents nearly 85% of footprint Employee commuting Yes For India operations, which represents nearly 85% of footprint Business travel Yes Includes air, conveyance and hotel stays.
Bus and train data (minor) will be  calculated and updated by July 2016.
Upstream leased assets  (Leased oﬃce space) Yes This is reported under Scope 1 & 2 Downstream scope 3  emissions No No product business, leased assets, franchisees or equity investments with  environmental impact Wipro Limited 61  Goals •	 Water Eﬃciency  - Improve water eﬃciency (fresh water  use per employee) by 5% year on year •	 Water Responsibility  - To ensure responsible water  management in proximate communities, especially in  locations that are prone to water scarcity •	 Water Security  - Recognizing water availability as a  business risk, to proactively assess and plan for the water  security of the organization in a manner that is congruent  with other two goals.
Freshwater recycling and eﬃciency:  The per employee water  consumption for the reporting year is 1.295 m3 per month  as compared to 1.36 in 2014-15, an improvement of around  4.78%.
We recycle 884,245 m3 of water in 27 of our major  locations (959,620 in 2014-15) using Sewage Treatment Plants  (STPs), which represents 32% (35% in 2014-15) of the total  water consumed.
The percentage of this recycled water as a  percentage of freshwater extracted is around 52%.
We have  recently commissioned ultra-/f_iltration and RO units for STP  treated water at three of our locations.
Harvested rainwater  contributes to nearly 2% of our total freshwater consumption  – which we intend to scale to around 5% in the next couple  of years.
We continue to focus on demand side optimization  measures though eﬃciency and better operational governance.
Sourcing of Water:  Water is withdrawn from four sources -  ground water, municipal water supplies, private purchase and  harvested rain water – with the /f_irst two sources accounting for  nearly 57% of the sourced water.
The majority of the balance  41% is from private sources near our operational facilities.
The  water supplied by the municipal bodies and the industrial  association are in turn sourced primarily from river or lake  systems.
Water that is purchased from private sources can be  traced to have been primarily extracted from ground water.
Community Water Programs: Wipro partners with experts  organizations, action groups and government bodies to  address issues aﬀecting the communities in the vicinity of our  organizations.
Participatory Ground Water Mapping Program (PGWM): Ground water is a primary source of water in Bengaluru,  especially for peripheral areas of the city which are not  connected to the city municipal supply (BWSSB).
Around  40-50% of total water requirement of the city is met through  ground water, which is largely unregulated.
It is a scarce  resource and many areas including the South east areas  (Electronics C ity- Sarjapur-Bellandur-White/f_ield corridor) are  severely stressed.
There is a high reliance on private supply  (tanker) of water, the source of which is again mostly ground  water.
Ground water being a shared common pool resource,  the governance choices are complex – from unregulated to  centralised responses to community centered management.
As part of our Responsible Water program, we aim to create a  community centered participatory approach for management  of ground water and lakes in the area.
This involves developing  an understanding of the hydrogeology of the watershed area  and speci/f_ic clusters and community engagement through  development of communication materials and advocacy.
PARTICITPATORY GROUND WATER MAPPING PROGRAM Hydrgeology Develop scienti/f_ic  understanding of aquifers in an  urban context watershed Protocols for interpretation  and action Social Creating communication  material for diﬀerent  stakeholders Curating multi-stakeholder  engagements (government,  citizens, acdemia) Platform Citizen centered interactive  online website Knowledge portal for wider  advocacy Ground water science for community action Karnataka State Water Network (KSWN) The Karnataka State Water Network (KSWN) was launched in  2014 by Wipro in partnership with the CII-Karnataka.
KSWN  is an Industry outreach that brings Businesses, Government,  Academia and Communities on a common platform to address  water challenges.
The purpose of KSWN is to create synergies  and scale among groups with common interest to be a force  multiplier.
The network has conducted 5 Curated programmes  and 2 annual conferences till date, where representatives from  6 geographical clusters and one theme based cluster around  Lakes have come together towards the creation of Water  Sustainable Zones and restoration of Lakes in Bengaluru.
A  Water Sustainable Zone is a geographic area that is partially or  62 Annual Report 2015-16 procedures and recycler requirements for electronic end of  life enable better traceability and disclosure of downstream  recycler practices.
We would work with our partners and  vendors in driving better practices and behaviors keeping in  mind both human and ecological impacts of any changes.
We monitor diesel generator stack emissions (NOx, Sox and  SPM) and indoor air quality (CO, CO2, VOC’s, RSPM are the key  parameters) across locations every month.
These meet the  speci/f_ied regulatory norms.
Goals Updates 100% of organic waste to be handled in- house in all owned locations Organic Waste Converters (OWC)’s commissioned in all owned locations.
90% of organic waste is being handled in-house.
Bio-gas currently operational in 3 locations and being evaluated for 3 other  locations.
100% of paper, cardboard, hazardous and  e-waste, mixed metals/scrap and plastics  to be recycled/ handled as per approved  methods 100% of waste is handled as per approved methods Internal audits are done as part of EHS Mixed solid waste and land/f_ill intensity to  reduce by 50%  by 2016-17 with 2013-14 as  the baseline year MSW: Baseline of 2013-14 is  3.26 Kg per employee per annum Target of 2016-17 is 1.60 Kg per employee per annum Actuals as of 2015-16 is 1.93 Kg per employee per annum Land/f_ill Intensity: Baseline of 2013-14 is  3.12 Kg per employee per annum Target of 2016-17 is 1.56 Kg per employee per annum Actuals as of 2015-16 is 3.04 Kg per employee per annum E-waste audit recommendations to be  actioned.

Alternative options being explored.
fully self-suﬃcient with respect to its water requirements i.e., its  water foot-print does not substantially exceed its geographic  boundaries.
The network is now working to incorporate itself  as a society with a strong governance framework, scale up its  activities for larger impact, and engage with Government to  inform policy.
Pollution and Waste Management: Pollution of air and water poses one of the most serious threats  to community health and welfare.
Our waste management  strategies are centered on either (i) recycling the waste for  further use or (ii) arranging for safe disposal.
To operationalize  our strategy, we follow robust processes of segregating waste  into organic, inorganic, e-waste, hazardous, packaging, and  biomedical and other categories, which is then either recycled  in-house or through outsourced vendor arrangements.
92% of the total solid waste (up from 90%  in 2014-15)  of  6,368 tons generated from our IT India operations is reused or  recycled –through both, in-house recycling units and through  authorized vendor tie-ups.
The balance, which is largely  mixed solid waste, construction debris and some categories  of inorganic waste is land/f_illed.
Our plan is to reduce Mixed  Solid Waste (MSW) generation at source and further drive  segregation into recyclable organic-inorganic to increase  diversion from land/f_ills.
We are also piloting recycling options for certain categories  like Thermocol and construction debris.
The revised operating  Land/f_ill, 5.71% Recycled  Internal 82.21% Incineration, 2.25% Recycled-External, 9.83% Waste Handling Summary Wipro Limited 63 In collaboration with InfoActiv, we helped create a platform in  the Electronic City Industrial area in Bangalore, India.
This zone  hosts a signi/f_icant majority of IT companies and is therefore a  source of sizable amounts of e-Waste.
The platform will help  align common focus areas, opportunities and streamline the  processes involved in the management of e-Waste from bulk  consumers.
A common e-waste collection center has been  commissioned and regular end of life electronic material is  being collected.
Apart from this, we continued to be part of  the sub-committee on ‘Waste’ in the CII National Environment  Committee.
We supported the “Reimagine Waste” hackathon  conducted at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru in  association with Waste Ventures and other partners.
We continually assess operational risks to the environment  and apply the precautionary principle in our approach to  gain insights and plan – for example, the responsible water  program and waste life cycle audits.
In the reporting period,  there were no instances of environmental /f_ines imposed or  negative consequences reported due to our operations.
We  proactively monitor regulatory compliances with respect to air,  water and waste – and the emissions and waste generated by  the organization are based on updated and approved consents  as on date from respective State and Central Pollution control  boards.
We proactively respond to queries and clari/f_ications  received by regulatory bodies.
Biodiversity As an organization with large campuses in urban settings,  we are acutely conscious of our responsibility towards urban  diversity and have set for ourselves the following goals.
•	 To convert /f_ive of our existing campuses to biodiversity  zones by 2017 •	 All new campuses will incorporate biodiversity principles  into their design In our approach towards campus biodiversity, our program  takes an integrated approach towards the contribution in  reducing energy and carbon intensity, improving water  retention and ambient air quality.
Our /f_irst /f_lagship project  in the Electronic City campus in Bangalore was initiated 5  years back with the /f_irst phase of a unique Butter/f_ly Park now  completed.
Our next phase includes an innovatively conceived  wetland biodiversity zone that will use recycled water.
We have completed the /f_irst phase of work on biodiversity  retro/f_it projects at our two campuses in Pune with a rigorous  and continuing assessment of seasonal census of /f_lora and  fauna biodiversity.
This project envisages /f_ive thematic gardens  – aesthetic and palm garden, spring garden, Ficus garden, spice  and fruit garden – through plantations of native species from  the local geography.
For one campus in Pune, the total number  of native species has nearly trebled from 59 to 242.
In all these  programs we work closely with expert partners in biodiversity,  conservation, ecological design and communications.
A work environment which integrates biodiverse and natural  design principles has multiple intangible bene/f_its for employees  and visitors – it helps build a larger sense of connectedness  and emphasizes values of sensitivity and our place in the  world around us.
We regularly conduct photography, nature  journaling, walks and plantation activities for employees and  their children.
Our participation in advocacy on biodiversity issues was  through two national levels forums – the CII-India Business for  Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) and the Leaders for Nature program  from the India chapter of International Union of Conservation  Networks (IU CN).
We chair CII-IBBI’s southern chapter on  biodiversity for business.
We also presented at the CII National  conference on biodiversity.
We have been supporting the  “World Sparrow Day” and the “Wipro-Nature Forever Society  Sparrow Awards” for the past /f_ive years.
Wipro’s Natural Capital Valuation Program –  An update Natural capital can be de/f_ined as the world’s stocks of natural  resources which make human life possible.
Businesses rely  on this natural capital to produce goods and deliver services.
They depend on natural non-renewable resources (for  example, fossil fuels and minerals) as well as natural renewable  ecosystem goods and services (for example, freshwater and  pollination).
Businesses also rely on natural capital for its  ability to absorb by-products of production such as pollution  and water.
Business extraction and production activities can  damage natural capital with long term economic and social  consequences.
These economic and social consequences manifest themselves  as physical, regulatory and reputational risks for companies.
One of the most useful ways for companies to account for  these risks is to quantify and value the environmental impacts  generated across their value chains in monetary terms.
Traditional ‘single parameter’ environmental metrics such  as cubic meters of water or hectares of land provide an  indication of the scale of dependency on ecosystem goods  and services or environmental impacts.
However, they often  fail to identify optimization opportunities for business.
Natural  capital valuation, on the other hand, provides a deeper insight  because it factors scale alongside critical environmental  parameters such as regional water scarcity and the ecosystem  services provided by land.
There are several global and national government-led projects  underway which aim to develop environmental accounts  and integrate them with traditional national accounts ( GDP)  including India.
UN Principle of Responsible Investing (UNPRI),  in 2010, estimated the environmental costs due to activities  of top 3,000 companies at US$ 6 Trillion per year.
The Natural  Capital C oalition (N CC), for example, is developing a Natural  Capital Protocol to provide a standardized approach to natural  capital accounting and valuation for businesses.
64 Annual Report 2015-16 Wipro, in association with Trucost (UK), has completed a  natural capital valuation exercise for the previous two /f_inancial  year 2013-14 and 2014-15.
The valuation for 2015-16 will be  completed by August 2016 – however the trends are unlikely  to be signi/f_icantly diﬀerent.
The valuation looks at our global  operational footprint - from energy related emissions, water  consumption, air/water pollution, waste generation and, land  use change, business travel, employee commute – as well as  from the embedded natural capital in all goods and services  that we procure from our supply chain.
The natural capital embedded in goods and services is primarily  based on valuation methodology that is based on Trucost’s  econometric Input-Output model which takes in spend across  diﬀerent sub-categories of procurement.
Monetization of  impacts is based on models and a selection of global and local  factors - hence certain assumptions and accounting rules are  inherent to the exercise.
The total environmental costs relating to Wipro’s operations  and supply chain was estimated at INR 10,075 million for the  /f_iscal year 2014-15.
The largest contributions (see /f_irst chart)  came from GHG emissions (51%), water abstraction and  pollution (25%) and air pollution (20%).
The second chart  below shows the breakdown in environmental costs across  each value chain stage.
The operational value chain stage  accounted for 36% of Wipro’s total environmental cost.
From a  geography perspective, as expected, India accounts for 82% of  the overall environmental cost.
The above /f_igures are net of our positive valuation that  are attributable to our environmental initiatives.
Wipro’s  environmental initiatives such as emissions reduction activities,  renewable energy procurement and water recycling reduced  its overall environmental costs by INR 884 million (9% of the  total 2014-15 environmental costs).
For Wipro, this study provides useful indicators to understand  impacts and assess the value of our environmental programs.
For external stakeholders like customers and analysts, these  data points provide a completely transparent full life-cycle  understanding of our environmental footprint.

For V. SREEDHARAN & ASSOCIATES  Company Secretaries  (V. Sreedharan) Partner FCS: 2347; CP No: 833 Bangalore  Date: April 20, 2016 90 Annual Report 2015-16 Annexure V: Corporate Social Responsibility Report for the year 2015-16 We present our report on Wipro’s social and environmental  initiatives, which are also referred to as CSR, for 2015-16.
The  year can be characterized as continuity amidst change.
While  we expanded some of our programs in scale and scope, our  basic strategic direction remained the same.
This strategic  foundation is something that has been built over the last /f_ifteen  years since we started our /f_irst program in social and community  engagement in 2001.
The core elements of our strategy are as  follows: • The values of Spirit of Wipro guides all our actions.
• To conduct our business on sound ethical principles and  widely accepted tenets of good corporate governance.
This includes compliance in letter and spirit with laws and  regulations everywhere we operate.
• To make our organization more sustainable as de/f_ined by  the triple bottom-line framework.
The primary areas of  focus are to (i) reduce our ecological footprint (ii) foster a  more diverse, empowered and fair workplace.
• To engage with identi/f_ied social challenges in a manner  that is deliberative and systemic.
We have chosen to focus  on Education and Ecology.
• To work with communities who are proximate to wherever  we have significant operational presence.
As a global  organization, we think that, it is important to try and make  a diﬀerence to communities everywhere and not only in  India.
Our ‘Good Citizen’ manifesto articulates a set of guiding   principles that inform our thinking and actions.
The manifesto  covers a wide range – a foundation of values as embedded in  Spirit of Wipro, compliance with laws and regulations, a robust  framework of corporate governance, proactive and strategic  engagement with key challenges of the environment and  society, serving our multiple stakeholders and working with  proximate communities, all in a manner that is thoughtful,  deliberative and systemic.
The salient highlights of our initiatives for 2015-16 are articulated  below.
You will also /f_ind in this report a detailed summary of  our sustainability initiatives under the ‘Business Responsibility  Reporting’ section.
It must be emphasized that our sustainability  and social programs are wide ranging and global in scope.
For  a fuller understanding of these, you may want to refer to our  comprehensive annual sustainability reports based on GRI  principles.
These and various other details are available at the  website www.wipro.com.
A.
Education  Our work in education covers a range of initiatives that  span early childhood care and education including school  education and higher education and systemic reforms to  children with disabilities to sustainability education.
Apart  from India, we have signi/f_icant programs in the U.S.A. as  well.
The common vision that ties this together is our belief  that education is a key enabler of change towards a better  society  A.1 Systemic reforms in school education: Over the past  15 years, we have worked to contribute to systemic reforms  in school education in India, through Wipro Applying  Thought in Schools (WATIS).
The strategy for this has  been to support the development and strengthening of  institutional capacity, by supporting organizations working  in school education reform eﬀorts.
We have supported and  closely partnered with over 70 organizations in diﬀerent  areas of systemic improvements in school education.
The  impact of this wide network of education organizations  has been noticeable in India’s large education system,  including on curriculum, text books, teacher education  and capacity, research and school leadership.
In addition to  developing long term institutional capacity, our work spans  113 educational projects with organizations, involving  over 18,600 schools and 34,500 educators across 17 states  reaching out to about 4.4 million students.
During 2015-16,  we initiated a new strategy of accelerating the expansion of  our partner ecosystem thereby supporting new ideas and  new organizations.
Six new partners were added during  the year.
Two of these new initiatives form part of our  seeding strategy to support new or early stage ideas from  committed and competent young people.
We supported a  total of 22 organizations during the year for work that tries  to address critical issues in the quality of teaching, learning,  educational material and the school environment.
As part  of the advocacy of such issues, the 16th national forum was  organized – a unique platform that brings together the  best minds in education in the country to deliberate and  exchange thoughts and ideas on some of the important  issues in education.
A.2 Education for the Proximate Disadvantaged:  Education is so critical that it is necessary, to engage on  multiple fronts.
While systemic reforms will continue to  be an important area for us, we also have a large program  that is designed for more direct impact on disadvantaged  children.
Run through Wipro Cares, the employee- supported trust of Wipro, the program reached out to  more than 65000 children in seven states.
The number  of projects in this area increased from 11 in the previous  year to 16.
One of the projects that we started during the  year was in Nagaland in North-East India which is relatively  underserved with respect to development.
The projects  cover disadvantaged children of migrant labourers, from  tribal communities, urban slums or street children.
An important initiative that we started in the previous  year was on children with disability.
This has scaled in  size and scope signi/f_icantly with 12 running projects that  reach out to 2,500 children with disability who are also  from socioeconomically underprivileged backgrounds.
Education for such disadvantaged sections is never about  Wipro Limited 91 just schooling.
It is linked to a whole host of other enabling  factors like availability of nutrition, community support,  specially trained teachers, assistive technology, and access  to healthcare etc.
Our approach tries to integrate these  dimensions to the extent possible.
Our work in this space  covers multiple categories of disability and focuses on early  intervention and inclusive education.
A.3.
Science Education in the U.S.A.: The Wipro Science  Education Fellowship (SEF) is a signi/f_icant program that  is focused on contributing to improving Science and  Math education in schools that serve disadvantaged  communities in US cities.
This initiative is aligned with the  U.S. federal government’s priority on improving science  and math education in their school system.
The program  is currently running in Chicago, New Jersey, New York and  Boston.
The program works in close collaboration in over  20 school districts wherein 250-350 teachers go through a  2-3 year fellowship with intense support to develop their  capacities to be better teachers and change leaders.
We are  partnering with University of Massachusetts, Boston and  Michigan State University.
Mercy College in New York and  Montclair State University in New Jersey are also involved./uni00A0   The current commitment of Wipro to these programs is  about 7.8 million USD over a period of 5 years, one of the  largest such commitments made by a non-US company  to the cause of improving science and math education  out there.
While this expenditure is not allowed under  the CSR rules of the Companies Act 2013, we think that  it is important to include this as part of our report.
We  would like to highlight the underlying principle here  that corporations must engage with social issues and  with communities wherever they have large operational  presence in the world.
A.4 Sustainability Education: Through Wipro-earthian  we try and bring together two of our key concerns:  Education and Sustainability.
The program completed its  /f_ifth year in early 2016 and saw a signi/f_icant expansion to  10,000 students and 2,200 school teachers across 2,000  schools in 45 districts across 21 states.
During the year, we  forged new partnerships with civil society organizations  and government bodies enabling us to expand our  reach in the states of Punjab, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh,  Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Our expanded reach also  included the new languages of Tamil, Malayalam and  Marathi in which schools could participate and submit  entries.
Our engagement with colleges on incorporating  sustainability into higher education saw several strategic  initiatives started during the year.
These include support  for sustainability research as part of the doctoral program  at IIM-Bangalore, partnering with IIM-Indore in curricular  development of a course on sustainability and a strategic  collaboration with Xavier University, Bhubaneswar for their  newly initiated School of Sustainability.
A.5 Technology Education: Given that IT Services industry  contributes nearly 10 % of India’s GDP and employs more  than 10 million people, its importance to the Indian and  global economy is unquestionable.
People with the right  skills and competencies form the bedrock of IT services  organizations.
The challenge for the Indian IT industry  going forward would be to ensure that the skills required  for the rapidly changing dynamic of the industry are  met.
As a leading company in this sector, we have always  owned this as a primary responsibility.
We have been  doing this on two important dimensions: (a) Imparting  post-graduate education in engineering and technology  to science graduates as the foundation for further skills  development in IT and (b) Capacity building among the  faculty of engineering colleges.
The Wipro Academy of Software Excellence (WASE) program  helps Science graduates to study for a Master’s degree in  Software Engineering (M. Tech).
Run in partnership with the  Birla Institute of Technology & Science (BITS), Pilani, India, this  unique program blends rigorous academic exposure with  practical professional learning at the workplace, we run a  similar program called WISTA in collaboration with Vellore  Institute of Technology (VIT) for science graduates without a  mathematics background.
Since its inception in 1995, Wipro  has supported and enabled more than 25000 students to  graduate from the WASE and WISTA programs with an MS  degree in Software Engineering.
During 2015-16, the total  number of new entrants into the two programs was 1810  while the aggregate strength across four years was 13805.
Mission10X started in 2007 has the goal of improving  education in India’s engineering colleges.
Over the last six  years Mission10X has reached out to over 28,830 faculty  members across 1300+ engineering colleges in 30 states.
The work involves faculty capacity development, and  curricular improvement.
The initiative has also catalyzed  more than 500 student projects.
B.
Working with Communities Everywhere  A primary tenet of our CSR strategy is that we must  engage with communities proximate to wherever we have  signi/f_icant operational presence in the world.
In particular,  we choose to work with underprivileged communities.
This  is organized through Wipro Cares, a unique trust that is  based on the operating model of employee contributions  matched by Wipro Ltd. Our work spans primary health- care, education, and ecology and disaster rehabilitation.
Of these, we have already spoken about our work on  community education in A2 above.
We articulate our work  and progress on the other dimensions below:  B.1 Primary Health Care: Access to primary health care  is a key determinant of an individual’s future trajectory  in life, including the ability to engage in productive  livelihoods and responsible citizenship, In India, nearly  600 million people do not have access to basic, aﬀordable,  good-quality health care.
Wipro Cares works with partners  92 Annual Report 2015-16 who oversee the delivery of good quality primary health  care services to underserved communities covering more  than 30000 people in 59 villages across Nagaland and  Maharashtra.
The North-East is relatively underserved in  terms of development and therefore, we thought that it is  imperative to start engaging there.
Our work in Nagaland  is in remote, inaccessible villages where health care  access has been weak or non-existent till now.
Similarly,  the work that we support in Maharashtra is in the remote  tribal district of Gadchiroli.
In both instances, the primary  goals are to build the capacity of the local community in  managing their health needs, to augment government  infrastructure and in training health workers to address  the unique needs of the communities.
B.2 Disaster Rehabilitation: Natural disasters like  earthquakes, /f_loods and cyclonic storms are an unfortunate  fact of life.
Whenever these happen, the disadvantaged  sections get aﬀected the most as the already fragile basis  of their livelihoods gets further disrupted.
Starting with the  Gujarat earthquake in 2001, we have responded to several  natural calamities wherein Wipro’s employees have also  risen to the occasion and played a sterling role.
By design,  we focus on the more diﬃcult challenge of long term  rehabilitation of the aﬀected communities.
However, there  are exceptions like the December /f_loods in Chennai when  we have also got involved in short term relief measures.
During 2015-16, ’Unnati’ the rehabilitation project that   we had initiated the previous year in Uttarakhand  progressed well on multiple fronts.
Our program seeks to  strengthen local livelihoods of communities in 22 villages  in the Uttarkashi district through improved farming  practices in organic agriculture.
A farmers’ cooperative  was set up during the year to strengthen market linkages,  a crucial element in the whole value chain.
Chennai saw  unprecedented rains, /f_loods and widespread damage in  December 2015.
The situation required immediate actions  on several fronts.
We partnered with Goonj to provide  relief in terms of dry rations, food and other essentials to  thousands of /f_lood aﬀected people in Chennai, Tiruvallur,  Kanchipuram and Cuddalore districts.
As always, our  employees rose up to the occasion by contributing  generously and going the extra mile in volunteering for  on-the-ground support.
B3.
International Chapters: We initiated support for a  unique program in North America in partnership with  Washington based First Book.
The program seeks to  encourage reading by providing free books to libraries  of schools that primarily serve underprivileged children.
Wipro employees across USA and Canada contributed  generously in terms of both, money and eﬀorts.
This along  with Wipro’s own funding support made it possible to  donate more than 35000 books and education resources.
Our Romania, Portugal and Philippines chapters also saw  a wide variety of employee activities covering areas as  diverse as school education, support for the elderly and  enhancing urban tree cover.
C. Ecology & Environment  Managing economic development in a manner that  does not compromise the ecological integrity of the  environment has posed one of the biggest challenges to  mankind.
It will be even more so in the coming decades  of this century.
The manifold problems of climate change,  water scarcity, biodiversity loss and pollution require all  stakeholders to act.
Responsible corporations can make a  signi/f_icant diﬀerence by aligning their resources, energy  and commitment with these problems in a purposeful way.
Wipro’s engagement with these issues goes back several  years and is based on the dual approach of (a) continually  improving the energy, water, waste and biodiversity  footprint of our business operations and (b) engaging on  community-level actions and advocacy on these issues.
We present below some salient highlights of our work in  2015-16.
C.1 The Challenges of Urban Water: Water scarcity is  perhaps the top most challenge that faces large parts of  the world including India.
Many cities in India face this  problem in varying dimensions.
The city of Bangalore has  seen plummeting ground water tables in the past few  years, especially in suburban areas like Sarjapur where we  have a large presence.
Over the past three years, we have  initiated strategic programs that seek to involve multiple  stakeholders in systemically understanding and addressing  the water problem.
The “Participative Ground Water  Program” in its second year, tries to address this problem  in the Sarjapur area in Bangalore which is completely  dependent on groundwater.
By involving citizens, water  experts and the government, we plan to develop model  solution templates that combine the science of aquifers,  crucial regulatory changes and active involvement of  citizen groups in exchanging and implementing good  practices in rainwater harvesting and wastewater  treatment.
In parallel, the larger city-wide movement on  water through the Karnataka State Water Network has  developed good traction with /f_ive geographic clusters and  a lake cluster working on several initiatives together.
C.2.
Urban Biodiversity: Our urban biodiversity program  addresses the twin goals of creating biodiversity in our  urban campuses while also using it as a platform for wider  education and advocacy, our first two projects are in  our Electronic City, Bangalore and Pune campuses.
After  completing the /f_irst phase of the butter/f_ly park in the  E-City campus, the second phase of creating an aquatic  wetland zone is in an advanced stage of completion.
The  Pune campus has also seen a transformation over the  last two years.
While the number of native species has  trebled, the creation of speci/f_ic ecological spaces within  the campus – for example, an herbal garden and a kitchen  Wipro Limited 93 garden – serves to illustrate the multidimensional bene/f_its  of biodiversity.
The importance of biodiversity being what  it is, we have made it a central plank of our sustainability  education program, Wipro-earthian as well as with our own  employees.
C.3 Urban Waste Management:  Eﬀective management of  urban solid waste continues to be a high priority challenge  for our cities.
While the use of right technology, good  governance and the active participation of civil society  are important determinants of success, the work of the  informal sector is often unrecognized.
In this regard, we  continued to strengthen a project that we had initiated in  2014-15 which focuses on providing social, nutritional and  health security to nearly 2000 workers in the informal sector  in Bangalore’s waste management space.
In addition, the  program also provides a comprehensive skills upgradation  program for about 200 such workers.
Here, let us emphasize  that in our internal operations, we continue to maintain  the highest standards of waste management – more than  95% of our solid waste, including e-Waste, is processed  or disposed safely.
In addition, we have been actively  supporting advocacy on eﬀective handling of e-waste  management at industry and civil society forums.
D. The Power of Engaged Employees  Employees are integral to many of our social programs.
The Wipro Cares trust is built on a model of employee  contribution that is matched by Wipro.
Nearly one in three  employees or more than 50,000 Wiproites are contributors  to Wipro Cares making this possibly the largest such  initiative in India and one of the largest in the world.
During  2015-16, nearly 7500 employees from across 21 chapters  collectively spent more than 13600 hours in voluntary  engagement on a wide range of social initiatives.
Involved  and engaged employees add great value to our programs.
It also enhances their own sense of larger purpose and  alignment with the Company’s Values.
In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that running  our CSR initiatives on a bedrock of good governance is a  matter of the highest priority.
We do this by combining  multiple elements: (a) Robust board oversight through  regular updates and quarterly reviews (b) Large programs  like Wipro Cares and Wipro Applying Thought in Schools  have their own board of trustees / governance committees  that validate all important decisions and provide direction  (c) Transparent and comprehensive reporting of our CSR  programs in the public domain so that all stakeholders can  provide feedback.
We will continue to ensure that Wipro’s social initiatives  build on the foundation of the past while remaining alive  to the changes needed in the future and responding  proactively.
Our work will be meaningful, relevant and  long-term oriented rather than being driven by mere  compliance.

Average Net Pro/f_it of the Company for the last three /f_inancial years: ` 78,002 Million  4.
Prescribed CSR Expenditure (two percent of the amount as in the point 3 above): 2% of the average PBT for the /f_inancial years 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16  amounts to ` 1,560 Million; against this, our CSR spending for 2015-16 was ` 1,598.22 Million.
5.
Details of the CSR spent during the /f_inancial year:  a) Total amount to be spent for the /f_inancial year: ` 1,560 Million  b) Amount unspent : Not applicable  c) Manner in which the amount is spent during the /f_inancial year is detailed below.
6.
The following table provides a summary of the domain wise expenditure on CSR for 2015-16 along with the geographies.
The list of partners with whom collaborate  is available right below the table.
7.
In the column ‘Cumulative expenditure till reporting period’ , we have chosen to take 2014-15 as the base year.
It is however not to be interpreted that this is the  /f_irst year of our CSR programs.
Many of our programs go back more than 10 years and some more than 15 years.
Hence, we have considered to report “cumulative  expenditure up to previous reporting period” and “cumulative expenditure up to reporting period” .
8.
All our programs are executed and implemented through our partners.
The /f_igures under the last column therefore are entirely through our partners.

: 101248W/ W-100022 Vijay Mathur Partner Membership number: 046476 Bangalore June 3, 2016 Standalone Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 133 Annexure - B to the Independent Auditors’ Report of even  date on the Standalone Financial Statements of Wipro Limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i)  of Sub-Section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013  (“the Act”) We have audited the internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial  reporting of Wipro Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31,  2016 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone /f_inancial  statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal /f_inancial controls based on the internal  control over financial reporting criteria established by the  Company considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating  eﬀectively for ensuring the orderly and eﬃcient conduct of  its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the  safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds  and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting based on our  audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing,  issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section  143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal /f_inancial controls, both applicable to an audit  of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the  Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial  reporting was established and maintained and if such controls  operated eﬀectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal /f_inancial controls  system over /f_inancial reporting and their operating eﬀectiveness.
Our audit of internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls over /f_inancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating eﬀectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the /f_inancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  ANNEXURE - B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS/quoteright.lat REPORT the Company’s internal /f_inancial controls system over /f_inancial  reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A company’s internal /f_inancial control over /f_inancial reporting is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of /f_inancial reporting and the preparation of /f_inancial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal /f_inancial  control over /f_inancial reporting includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/f_lect the transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of /f_inancial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material  eﬀect on the /f_inancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal /f_inancial controls  over /f_inancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting to future periods  are subject to the risk that the internal /f_inancial control over  /f_inancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies  or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an  adequate internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and such internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial  reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2016,  based on the internal control over /f_inancial reporting criteria  established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Signi/f_icant accounting policies i.
Basis of preparation of standalone /f_inancial statements  The standalone financial statements are prepared in  accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  in India (GAAP) under the historical cost convention on  the accrual basis, except for certain /f_inancial instruments  which are measured on a fair value basis.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) read with  Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, and the  relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 2013  Act”) / Companies Act, 1956 (“the 1956 Act”), as applicable,  Accounting Standards (‘AS’)/guidance notes issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and other  generally accepted accounting principles in India.
All amounts included in the financial statements are  reported in millions of Indian rupees (` in millions) except  share and per share data, unless otherwise stated.
Due  to rounding oﬀ, the numbers presented throughout the  document may not add up precisely to the totals and  percentages may not precisely re/f_lect the absolute /f_igures.
ii.
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that aﬀect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date  of /f_inancial statements and reported amounts of income  and expenses during the year.
Estimates and underlying  assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revision  to accounting estimates is recognised in the year in which  the estimates are revised and in any future year aﬀected.
iii.
Goodwill  The goodwill arising on acquisition of a group of assets is  not amortised and is tested for impairment if indicators of  impairment exist.
iv.
Fixed assets  Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss, if any.
Costs include  expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of  the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  construction or production of qualifying assets are  capitalized as part of the cost.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted for as  separate items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property,  plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable  that future economic bene/f_its associated with these will  /f_low to the Company and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid for  acquisition less accumulated amortization and impairment  loss, if any.
Cost of /f_ixed assets not ready for use before the balance  sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets  outstanding as of each balance sheet date is disclosed  under long term loans and advances.
v. Investments  Non-current investments are stated at cost less other than  temporary diminution in the value of such investments, if  any.
Current investments are valued at lower of cost and  fair value determined by category of investment.
The fair  value is determined using quoted market price/market  observable information adjusted for cost of disposal.
On  disposal of the investment, the diﬀerence between its  carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or  credited to the statement of pro/f_it and loss.
vi.
Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost  is determined using the weighted average method.
Cost  of work-in-progress and /f_inished goods include material  cost and appropriate share of manufacturing overheads.
Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs  of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the  inventories to their present location and condition.
vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an out/f_low of resources will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of obligation.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Standalone Financial Statements under India GAAP 138 Annual Report 2015-16  A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is  a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but  probably will not, require an out/f_low of resources.
Where  there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in  respect of which the likelihood of out/f_low of resources is  remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the  expected bene/f_its to be derived from the contract are  lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the future  obligations under the contract.
viii.
Revenue recognition  The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware and  related services, business process services, sale of IT and  other products.
Services:  The Company recognizes revenue when the signi/f_icant  terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have  been delivered and collectability is reasonably assured.
The  method of recognizing the revenues and costs depends on  the nature of the services rendered: A.
Time and material contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and material contracts  are recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from /f_ixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized  using the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage  of completion is determined based on project costs  incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project  costs required to complete the project.
The cost expended  (or input) method has been used to measure progress  towards completion as there is a direct relationship  between input and productivity.
If the Company does  not have a suﬃcient basis to measure the progress of  completion or to estimate the total contract revenues and  costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract  cost incurred for which recoverability is probable.
When  total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of  pro/f_it and loss in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ included in other current asset  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at the  end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned revenues’ included  in other current liabilities represent billing in excess of  revenue recognized.
Advance payments received from  customers for which no services have been rendered are  presented as ‘Advances from customers’ .
C. Maintenance contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably  over the period of the contract using the percentage of  completion method.
When services are performed through  an inde/f_inite number of repetitive acts over a speci/f_ied  period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the speci/f_ied period unless some other method  better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a /f_ixed quantum of service or output units  is agreed at a /f_ixed price for a /f_ixed term.
In such contracts,  revenue is recognized with respect to the actual output  achieved till date as a percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual service unutilized by the customer is recognized  as revenue on completion of the term.
D.  Others   • The Company accounts for volume discounts and  pricing incentives to customers by reducing the  amount of revenue recognized at the time of sale.
• Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value added tax,  service tax and applicable discounts and allowances.
Revenue includes excise duty.
• The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties  at the time when the revenue is recognized.
The  accruals are based on the Company’s historical  experience of material usage and service delivery costs.
• Costs that relate directly to a contract and incurred  in securing a contract are recognized as an asset and  amortised over the contract term.
• Contract expenses are recognised as expenses by  reference to the stage of completion of contract  activity at the end of the reporting period.
Products:  Revenue from products are recognized when the signi/f_icant  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to  the buyer, continuing managerial involvement usually  associated with ownership and effective control have  ceased, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably,  it is probable that economic bene/f_its associated with the  transaction will /f_low to the Company and the costs incurred  or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be  measured reliably.
Other income:  Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion method,  based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
ix.
Leases  a) Arrangements where the Company is the lessee    Leases of assets, where the Company assumes  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  are classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases.
Finance leases are  Standalone Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 139 capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased  assets at inception and the present value of minimum  lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned  between the /f_inance charge and the outstanding  liability.
The /f_inance charge is allocated to periods  during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of  interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classi/f_ied as operating  leases.
Lease rentals in respect of assets taken under  operating leases are charged to pro/f_it and loss account  on a straight line basis over the lease term.
b) Arrangements where the Company is the lessor    In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes  revenue from the sale of products given under  /f_inance leases.
The Company records gross /f_inance  receivables, unearned interest income and the  estimated residual value of the leased equipment  on consummation of such leases.
Unearned interest  income represents the excess of the gross /f_inance  lease receivable plus the estimated residual value  over the sales price of the equipment.
The Company  recognizes unearned interest income as /f_inancing  revenue over the lease term using the effective  interest method.
x.
Foreign currency transactions  Transaction:  The Company is exposed to currency /f_luctuations on foreign  currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions are  accounted in the books of account at the exchange rates  prevailing on the date of transaction.
The diﬀerence between the rate at which foreign currency  transactions are accounted and the rate at which they are  realized is recognized in the statement of pro/f_it and loss.
Translation:  Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities at period- end are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the  date of Balance Sheet.
The diﬀerence arising from the  translation is recognised in the statement of pro/f_it and loss,  except for the exchange diﬀerence arising on monetary  items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash /f_low  hedge or hedge of a net investment in a non-integral  foreign operation.
In such cases the exchange diﬀerence is  initially recognised in hedging reserve or Foreign Currency  Translation Reserve (FCTR), respectively.
Such exchange  diﬀerences are subsequently recognised in the statement  of profit and loss on occurrence of the underlying  hedged transaction or on disposal of the investment,  respectively.
Further, foreign currency diﬀerences arising  from translation of intercompany receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, the settlement of which  is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future,  are considered to form part of net investment in foreign  operation and are recognized in FCTR.
When a foreign  operation is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized  in FCTR is transferred to the statement of pro/f_it and loss as  part of the pro/f_it or loss on disposal.
xi.
Financial Instruments  Financial instruments are recognised when the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  instrument.
Derivative instruments and Hedge accounting:  The Company is exposed to foreign currency /f_luctuations  on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in a  non-integral foreign operation and forecasted cash /f_lows  denominated in foreign currency.
The Company limits the  eﬀects of foreign exchange rate /f_luctuations by following  established risk management policies including the use of  derivatives.
The Company enters into derivative /f_inancial  instruments, where the counterparty is primarily a bank.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward  contracts taken to hedge foreign currency risk of an existing  asset / liability is recognised in the statement of pro/f_it and  loss over the period of the contract.
Exchange diﬀerences  on such contracts are recognised in the statement of pro/f_it  and loss of the reporting period in which the exchange  rates change.
The Company has adopted the principles of Accounting  Standard 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition and  Measurement (AS 30) issued by the ICAI to the extent  the adoption of AS 30 does not conflict with existing  accounting standards prescribed by Companies (Accounts)  Rules, 2014 and other authoritative pronouncements.
In accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles set out in AS 30, changes in fair value of derivative  /f_inancial instruments designated as cash /f_low hedges are  recognised directly in Reserves and surplus and reclassi/f_ied  into the statement of pro/f_it and loss upon the occurrence  of the hedged transaction.
The Company designates derivative /f_inancial instruments  as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging  instruments and gains/losses on translation or settlement  of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated  as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations are  recognized in Reserves and Surplus to the extent that  the hedge is eﬀective.
To the extent that the hedge is  ineﬀective, changes in fair value are recognized in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective  portion of the hedges and derivative instruments that do  not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is  determined based on observable market inputs including  Standalone Financial Statements under India GAAP 140 Annual Report 2015-16 currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency  volatility etc.
xii.
Depreciation and amortisation  The Company has provided for depreciation using straight  line method over the useful life of the assets as prescribed                            under part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013  except in the case of following assets which are depreciated  based on useful lives estimated by the Management: Class of asset Estimated  useful life Building 28 – 40 years Plant and machinery 5 – 21 years Oﬃce equipment 3 – 10 years Vehicles 4 – 5  years Furniture and /f_ixtures 3 – 10 years Electrical installations (included under plant  and machinery) 2 – 7 years Computer equipment and software (included  under plant and machinery) 2 – 7 years  For the class of assets mentioned above, based on technical  assessment the management believes that the useful  lives as given above best represent the period over which  management expects to use these assets.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Payments for leasehold land are amortised over the period  of lease.
Assets under finance lease are amortised over their  estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is lower.
The estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible  assets for the current and comparative periods are as follows:  Class of asset Estimated  useful life Technical Know-how, Patents, Trademark and  others 3-5 years xiii.
Impairment of assets  Financial assets:  The Company assesses at each period end whether there  is any objective evidence that a /f_inancial asset or group of  /f_inancial assets is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the amount of impairment loss.
The  amount of loss for receivables is measured as the diﬀerence  between the assets carrying amount and undiscounted  amount of future cash /f_lows.
Impairment loss, if any, is  recognised in the statement of pro/f_it and loss.
If at the  balance sheet date there is any indication that a previously  assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recognised  impairment loss is reversed, subject to maximum of initial  carrying amount of the short-term receivable.
Other than /f_inancial assets:   The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether  there is any indication that a non-/f_inancial asset including  goodwill may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable  amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset  belongs to is less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The reduction  is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
If at the balance sheet date  there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment  loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed  and the asset is re/f_lected at the recoverable amount subject  to a maximum of depreciated historical cost.
In respect of  goodwill, the impairment loss will be reversed only when  it was caused by speci/f_ic external events of an exceptional  nature that is not expected to recur and their eﬀects have  been reversed by subsequent external events.
xiv.

The excess tax paid under MAT  provisions being over and above regular tax liability can  be carried forward for a period of ten years from the year  of recognition and is available for set oﬀ against future tax  liabilities computed under regular tax provisions, to the  extent of MAT liability.
Deferred tax:  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the  future tax consequences attributable to timing diﬀerences  that result between the pro/f_it oﬀered for income taxes and  the pro/f_it as per the /f_inancial statements of each entity in  the group of the Company.
Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of timing  diﬀerences which originate during the tax holiday period  but reverse after the tax holiday period.
For this purpose,  reversal of timing diﬀerence is determined using /f_irst in /f_irst  out method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax  rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the balance sheet date.
The eﬀect on deferred  tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised  in the period that includes the enactment/substantive  enactment date.
Deferred tax assets on timing diﬀerences are recognised  only if there is a reasonable certainty that suﬃcient future  taxable income will be available against which such deferred  tax assets can be realized.
However, deferred tax assets on  the timing diﬀerences when unabsorbed depreciation  and losses carried forward exist, are recognised only to  the extent that there is virtual certainty that suﬃcient  future taxable income will be available against which such  deferred tax assets can be realized.
Deferred tax assets are reassessed for the appropriateness  of their respective carrying amounts at each balance sheet  date.
The Company oﬀsets, on a year on year basis, the current  and non-current tax assets and liabilities, where it has a  legally enforceable right and where it intends to settle such  assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted  proportionately during the period, unless issued at a later  date.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive  equity shares are adjusted for any stock splits and bonus  shares issued.

As per the plan, the Company’s India operations  have export obligations to the extent of net positive  foreign exchange (i.e.
foreign exchange in/f_low - foreign  exchange outflow should be positive) over a five year  period.
The consequence of not meeting this commitment  in the future would be a retroactive levy of import duties  on certain hardware previously imported duty free.
As at  March 31, 2016, the Company believes that it has met all  the commitments substantially required under the plan.
Tax Demands:   The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  (including tax assessment orders/ penalty notices) which  have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
Some  of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible  to make a reasonable estimate of the expected /f_inancial  eﬀect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of  such proceedings.
However, the resolution of these legal  proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse  eﬀect on the results of operations or the /f_inancial position of  the Company.
The signi/f_icant of such matters are discussed  below.
In March 2004, the Company received a tax demand for  year ended March 31, 2001 arising primarily on account of  denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax  Act, 1961 (Act) in respect of pro/f_it earned by the Company’s  undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bangalore.
The  same issue was repeated in the successive assessments for  the years ended March 31, 2002 to March 31, 2011 and  the aggregate demand is /uni20B9 47,583 (including interest of /uni20B9  13,832).
The appeals /f_iled against the said demand before  the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of  the Company by the second appellate authority for the  years up to March 31, 2007.
Further appeals have been  /f_iled by the Income tax authorities before the Hon’ble High  Court.
The Hon’ble High Court has heard and disposed-oﬀ  majority of the issues in favor of the Company up to years  ended March 31, 2004.
On similar issues for years up to March 31, 2000, the  Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka has upheld the claim of  the Company under section 10A of the Act.
For the years  ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, the appeals are  pending before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal).
For years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, the  Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) allowed the claim of the  Company under section 10A of the Act.
The Income tax  authorities have /f_iled an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March 31, 2012, the Company received the  draft assessment order in March 2016 with a proposed  demand of /uni20B9 4,241 (including interest of /uni20B9 1,376), arising  primarily on account of section 10AA issues with respect  to exclusion from Export Turnover.
Company has /f_iled an  objection before DRP within the prescribed timelines.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the  order of the appellate authority / Hon’ble High Court of  Karnataka upholding the claims of the Company for earlier  years, the Company believes that the /f_inal outcome of the  above disputes should be in favor of the Company and  there should not be any material adverse impact on the  /f_inancial statements.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for  the preparation of these consolidated /f_inancial statements in  terms of the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the  Act”) that give a true and fair view of the consolidated /f_inancial  position, consolidated /f_inancial performance and consolidated  cash /f_lows of the Company in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting  Standards speci/f_ied under Section 133 of the Companies Act,  2013 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) read with Rule 7 of  the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
The respective Board of   Directors of the Companies included in the group are responsible  for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance  with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of  the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other  irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal /f_inancial controls, that were  operating eﬀectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the consolidated /f_inancial statements that give  a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the  purpose of preparation of the consolidated /f_inancial statements  by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated  /f_inancial statements based on our audit.
While conducting the audit, we have taken into account the  provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards and  matters which are required to be included in the audit report  under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards  on Auditing speci/f_ied under section 143(10) of the Act.
Those  standards require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the consolidated /f_inancial statements are free  from material misstatement.
Independent Auditors/quoteright.lat Report on  Consolidated Financial Statements An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the  consolidated /f_inancial statements.
The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment  of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  /f_inancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making  those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal /f_inancial  control relevant to the Holding Company’s preparation of the  consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair  view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances.
An audit also includes evaluating the  appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the  Holding Company’s Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the  overall presentation of the consolidated /f_inancial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is suﬃcient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the  consolidated /f_inancial statements.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  /f_inancial statements give the information required by the Act  in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in  conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in  India, of the consolidated state of aﬀairs of the Group, as at March  31, 2016, and their consolidated pro/f_it and their consolidated  cash /f_lows for the year ended on that date.
Emphasis of matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to note 30 to the  consolidated /f_inancial statements which describes the principles of  Accounting Standard (AS) 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition  and Measurement, applied by the Group on certain foreign currency  borrowings designated as a hedging instrument to hedge its net  investment in non-integral foreign operations.
These principles of AS  30, are yet to be noti/f_ied under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7  of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
Had the Group not applied  the principles of AS 30, the pro/f_it after taxation for the year ended   March 31, 2016 would have been lower by ` 856 million (2015: `  390 million).

: 046476 Bangalore June 3, 2016 Annexure - A to the Independent Auditors’ Report of even  date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Wipro  Limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i)  of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013  (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated  financial statements of the Company as of and for the  year ended March 31, 2016, we have audited the  internal financial controls over financial reporting of   Wipro Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiary  companies which are companies incorporated in India, as of  that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and  its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in  India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal  /f_inancial controls based on the internal control over /f_inancial  reporting criteria established by the Company considering  the essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities include the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  /f_inancial controls that were operating eﬀectively for ensuring  the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable /f_inancial information, as required under  the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting based on  our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI  and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to  be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013,  to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /f_inancial controls,  both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal  financial controls over financial reporting was established  and maintained and if such controls operated eﬀectively in all  material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over /f_inancial reporting and their operating  effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over  Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 173 /f_inancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of  internal /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting, assessing the  risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating eﬀectiveness of internal control  based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the /f_inancial statements, whether  due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suﬃcient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Company’s internal /f_inancial controls system over /f_inancial  reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting A company’s internal /f_inancial control over /f_inancial reporting is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of /f_inancial reporting and the preparation of /f_inancial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal /f_inancial  control over /f_inancial reporting includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,  in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/f_lect the transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of /f_inancial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and directors  of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,  or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material  eﬀect on the /f_inancial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal /f_inancial controls  over /f_inancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  /f_inancial controls over /f_inancial reporting to future periods  are subject to the risk that the internal /f_inancial control over  /f_inancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies  or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary  companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have,  in all material respects, an adequate internal /f_inancial controls  system over /f_inancial reporting and such internal /f_inancial controls  over /f_inancial reporting were operating eﬀectively as at March  31, 2016, based on the internal control over /f_inancial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Signi/f_icant accounting policies  i.
Basis of preparation of the consolidated /f_inancial  statements   The consolidated /f_inancial statements are prepared  in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles in India (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis, except for  certain /f_inancial instruments which are measured  on a fair value basis.
GAAP comprises mandatory  accounting standards as prescribed under Section  133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) read with  Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, and  the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  (“the 2013 Act”)/Companies Act, 1956 (“the 1956  Act”), as applicable, Accounting Standards (‘AS’)/ guidance notes issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India (ICAI) and other generally  accepted accounting principles in India.
All amounts included in the consolidated /f_inancial  statements are reported in millions of Indian rupees  (` in millions) except share and per share data, unless  otherwise stated.
Due to rounding oﬀ, the numbers  presented throughout the document may not add  up precisely to the totals and percentages may not  precisely re/f_lect the absolute /f_igures.
ii.
Principles of consolidation   The consolidated /f_inancial statements have been  prepared on the following basis:   - The consolidated /f_inancial statements include  the /f_inancial statements of Wipro and all its  subsidiaries, which are more than 50% owned  or controlled.
The /f_inancial statements of the  parent company and its majority owned/ controlled subsidiaries which are drawn up to  the same reporting date have been combined  on a line by line basis by adding together the  book values of all items of assets, liabilities,  incomes and expenses after eliminating all  intra-group balances/transactions and resulting  unrealized gain/loss.
- The excess of the cost to the parent of its  investments in a subsidiary over the parent’s  portion of equity at the date on which investment  in the subsidiary is made, is recognised as  ‘Goodwill’ .
When the cost to the parent of its  investment in a subsidiary is less than the parent’s  portion of equity of the subsidiary at the date on  which investment in the subsidiary is made, the  diﬀerence is treated as ‘Capital Reserve’ in the  consolidated /f_inancial statements.
- Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated  subsidiaries consists of:    a)  the amount of equity attributable to the  minorities  at the dates on which investment  in a subsidiary is made; and    b)  the minorities share of movements in  equity since the date, the parent subsidiary  relationship came into existence.
Minority interest in share of net result for the  year is identi/f_ied and adjusted against the pro/f_it  after tax.
Excess of loss, if any, attributable to the  minority over and above the minority interest  in the equity of the subsidiaries is absorbed by  the Company.
- The consolidated financial statements are  prepared using uniform accounting policies for  similar transactions and other events in similar  circumstances.
iii.
Use of estimates   The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that aﬀect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities  as at the date of /f_inancial statements and reported  amounts of income and expenses during the year.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis.
Revision to accounting estimates  is recognised in the year in which the estimates are  revised and in any future year aﬀected.
iv.
Fixed assets   Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if  any.
Costs include expenditure directly attributable to  the acquisition of the asset.
Borrowing costs directly  Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP 178 Annual Report 2015-16 attributable to the construction or production of  qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have diﬀerent useful lives, they are accounted for as  separate items (major components) of property, plant  and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating  to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only  when it is probable that future economic bene/f_its  associated with these will /f_low to the Company and  the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid  for acquisition less accumulated amortisation and  impairment loss, if any.
Cost of fixed assets not ready for use before the  balance sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in- progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of  /f_ixed assets outstanding as of each balance sheet date  is disclosed under long term loans and advances.
v. Investments   Non-current investments are stated at cost less other  than temporary diminution in the value of such  investments, if any.
Current investments are valued at  lower of cost and fair value determined by category of  investment.
The fair value is determined using quoted  market price/market observable information adjusted  for cost of disposal.
On disposal of the investment,  the difference between its carrying amount and  net disposal proceeds is charged or credited to the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
vi.
Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realizable value, including necessary provision for  obsolescence.
Cost is determined using the weighted  average method.
Cost of work-in-progress and  /f_inished goods include material cost and appropriate  share of manufacturing overheads.
Cost of inventories  comprises all costs of purchase and other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to their present  location and condition.
vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities   Provisions are recognised when the Company has  a present obligation as a result of past events, it is  probable that an out/f_low of resources will be required  to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can  be made of the amount of the obligation.
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when  there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may, but probably will not, require an out/f_low of  resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a  present obligation in respect of which the likelihood  of out/f_low of resources is remote, no provision or  disclosure is made.
Provision for onerous contracts is recognized when  the expected bene/f_its to be derived from the contract  are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the  future obligations under the contract.
viii.
Revenue recognition   The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware  and related services, business process services, sale  of IT and other products.
a)  Services    The Company recognizes revenue when the  significant terms of the arrangement are  enforceable, services have been delivered and  collectability is reasonably assured.
The method  for recognizing revenues and costs depends on  the nature of the services rendered:   A.
Time and materials contracts    Revenues and costs relating to time and  materials contracts are recognized as the related  services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts    Revenues from /f_ixed-price contracts, including  systems development and integration contracts  are recognized using the “percentage-of- completion” method.
Percentage of completion  is determined based on project costs incurred  to date as a percentage of total estimated  project costs required to complete the project.
The cost expended (or input) method has been  used to measure progress towards completion  as there is a direct relationship between input  and productivity.
If the Company does not  have a suﬃcient basis to measure the progress  of completion or to estimate the total contract  revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only  to the extent of contract cost incurred for which  recoverability is probable.
When total cost  estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss in the period in  which such losses become probable based on  the current contract estimates.
Unbilled revenues included in other current assets  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings  as at the end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned  revenues’ included in other current liabilities  represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.
Advance payments received from customers  for which no services have been rendered are  presented as ‘Advance from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance contracts    Revenue from maintenance contracts is  Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 179 recognized ratably over the period of the  contract using the percentage of completion  method.
When services are performed through  an inde/f_inite number of repetitive acts over a  speci/f_ied period of time, revenue is recognized  on a straight-line basis over the speci/f_ied period  unless some other method better represents the  stage of completion.
In certain projects, a /f_ixed quantum of service or  output units is agreed at a /f_ixed price for a /f_ixed  term.
In such contracts, revenue is recognized  with respect to the actual output achieved till  date as a percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual service unutilized by the customer is  recognized as revenue on completion of the term.
D.  Others    •   The Company accounts for volume discounts  and pricing incentives to customers by  reducing the amount of revenue recognized  at the time of sale.
•   Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value  added tax, service tax and applicable  discounts and allowances.
Revenue includes  excise duty.
•   The Company accrues the estimated cost of  warranties at the time when the revenue is  recognized.
The accruals are based on the  Company’s historical experience of material  usage and service delivery costs.
•  Costs that relate directly to a contract  and incurred in securing a contract are  recognized as an asset and amortized over  the contract term.
•   Contract expenses are recognised as  expenses by reference to the stage of  completion of contract activity at the end  of the reporting period.
b)  Products:   Revenue from products are recognized when the  signi/f_icant risks and rewards of ownership have been  transferred to the buyer, continuing managerial  involvement usually associated with ownership and  eﬀective control have ceased, the amount of revenue  can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic  bene/f_its associated with the transaction will /f_low to  the Company and the costs incurred or to be incurred  in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
c) Other income:   Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion  method, based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s  right to receive dividend is established.
ix.
Leases   a) Arrangements where the Company is the lessee    Leases of assets, where the Company assumes  substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the lower of the  fair value of the leased assets at inception and  the present value of minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the  /f_inance charge and the outstanding liability.
The  /f_inance charge is allocated to periods during the  lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest  on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership are classi/f_ied  as operating leases.
Lease rentals in respect of  assets taken under operating leases are charged  to pro/f_it and loss account on a straight line basis  over the lease term.
b)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessor    In certain arrangements, the Company  recognizes revenue from the sale of products  given under finance leases.
The Company  records gross finance receivables, unearned  interest income and the estimated residual value  of the leased equipment on consummation  of such leases.
Unearned interest income  represents the excess of the gross /f_inance lease  receivable plus the estimated residual value  over the sales price of the equipment.
The  Company recognizes unearned interest income  as /f_inancing revenue over the lease term using  the eﬀective interest method.
x.

Foreign currency  transactions are accounted at the exchange rates  prevailing on the date of transaction.
Translation:   Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities  at period-end are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing at the date of Balance Sheet.
The diﬀerence  arising from the translation is recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss, except for the exchange  diﬀerence arising on monetary items that qualify as  hedging instruments in a cash /f_low hedge or hedge of  a net investment in a non-integral foreign operation.
In such cases the exchange difference is initially  recognised in hedging reserve or Foreign Currency  Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP 180 Annual Report 2015-16 Translation Reserve (FCTR), respectively.
Such  exchange diﬀerences are subsequently recognised  in the statement of pro/f_it and loss on occurrence of  the underlying hedged transaction or on disposal of  the investment, respectively.
Further, foreign currency  diﬀerences arising from translation of intercompany  receivables or payables relating to foreign operations,  the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely  in the foreseeable future, are considered to form  part of net investment in foreign operation and are  recognized in FCTR.
When a foreign operation is  disposed of, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR  is transferred to the statement of pro/f_it and loss as  part of the pro/f_it or loss on disposal.
Integral operations:   Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing at the date of the balance  sheet.
Non-monetary items are translated at the  historical rate.
The items in the statement of pro/f_it and  loss are translated at the average exchange rate during  the period.
The diﬀerences arising out of the translation  are recognised in the statement of pro/f_it and loss.
Non-integral operations:   Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange  rate prevailing at the date of the balance sheet.
The  items in the statement of pro/f_it and loss are translated  at the average exchange rate during the period.
The differences arising out of the translation are  transferred to foreign currency translation reserve.
On the disposal of a non-integral foreign operation,  the cumulative FCTR which relates to that operation  is recognized in the statement of pro/f_it and loss.
The amended AS 11 provides an irrevocable option to  the Company to amortise exchange rate /f_luctuation  on long term foreign currency monetary asset/liability  over the life of the asset/liability or March 31, 2020,  whichever is earlier.
The amendment is applicable  retroactively from the /f_inancial year beginning on or  after December 7, 2006.

The Company enters into derivative  financial instruments, where the counterparty is  primarily a bank.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward  contracts entered into hedge foreign currency risk  of an existing asset/liability is recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss over the period of the  contract.
Exchange diﬀerences on such contracts are  recognised in the statement of pro/f_it and loss of the  reporting period in which the exchange rates change.
The Company has adopted the principles of  Accounting Standard 30, Financial Instruments:  Recognition and Measurement (AS 30) issued by  the ICAI to the extent the adoption of AS 30 does  not conflict with existing accounting standards  prescribed by Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and  other authoritative pronouncements.
In accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles set out in AS 30, changes in fair value of  derivative /f_inancial instruments designated as cash  flow hedges are recognised directly in Reserves  and Surplus and reclassi/f_ied into the statement of  pro/f_it and loss upon the occurrence of the hedged  transaction.
The Company designates derivative financial  instruments as hedges of net investments in foreign  operations.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative  hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation  or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings designated as a hedge of net investment  in foreign operations are recognized in Reserves and  Surplus to the extent that the hedge is eﬀective.
To  the extent that the hedge is ineﬀective, changes in  fair value are recognized in the statement of pro/f_it  and loss.
Changes in fair value relating to the ineﬀective portion  of the hedges and derivatives that do not qualify for  hedge accounting are recognised in the statement  of pro/f_it and loss.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments  is determined based on observable market inputs  including currency spot and forward rates, yield  curves, currency volatility etc.
xii.
Depreciation and amortisation   The Company has provided for depreciation using  straight line method over the useful life of the assets  as prescribed under part C of Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013 except in the case of following  assets which are depreciated based on useful lives  estimated by the Management: Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 181 Class of asset Estimated   Useful Life  Building 28 – 40 years Plant and machinery 5 – 21 years Oﬃce equipment 3  – 10 years Vehicles 4 – 5  years Furniture and /f_ixtures 3  – 10 years Electrical installations (included  under plant and machinery) 2 – 7 years Computer equipment and  software (included under plant  and machinery) 2 – 7 years   For the class of assets, based on technical assessment,  management believes that the useful lives as given  above best represents the period over which assets  are expected to be used.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Assets under /f_inance lease are amortised over their  estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is  lower.
Payments for leasehold land are amortised over the  period of lease.
The estimated useful lives of the amortizable  intangible assets for the current and comparative  periods are as follows: Class of asset Estimated   Useful Life  Customer-contract intangibles 5-10 years Technical know-how, patents,  trademarks and others 3-10 years  xiii.
Impairment of assets   Financial assets:   The Company assesses at each period end whether  there is any objective evidence that a /f_inancial asset  or group of /f_inancial assets is impaired.
If any such  indication exists, the Company estimates the amount  of impairment loss.
The amount of loss for receivables  is measured as the diﬀerence between the assets  carrying amount and undiscounted amount of future  cash /f_lows.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
If at the balance sheet  date there is any indication that a previously assessed  impairment loss no longer exists, the recognised  impairment loss is reversed, subject to maximum of  initial carrying amount of the short-term receivable.
Other than /f_inancial assets:   The Company assesses at each period end whether  there is any indication that a non-financial asset  including goodwill may be impaired.
If any such  indication exists, the Company estimates the  recoverable amount of the asset.
If such recoverable  amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit to which the asset belongs to is  less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is  reduced to its recoverable amount.
The reduction is  treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the  statement of pro/f_it and loss.
If at the balance sheet  date there is an indication that a previously assessed  impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable  amount is reassessed and the asset is re/f_lected at  the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of  depreciated historical cost.
In respect of goodwill,  the impairment loss will be reversed only when it was  caused by speci/f_ic external events of an exceptional  nature that is not expected to recur and their eﬀects  have been reversed by subsequent external events.
xiv.

Accordingly, the translation gain/(loss) on the foreign  currency borrowings and portion of the changes in fair  value of interest rate swap which are determined to be  eﬀective hedge of net investment in non-integral operation  and cash flow hedge of foreign currency borrowings  aggregating to ` (901) for the year ended March 31, 2016  [2015: ` (524)] was recognized in translation reserve/  hedging reserve in shareholders’ funds.
The amount of  gain/ (loss) of ` (856) for the year ended March 31, 2016  [2015: ` (390)] recognized in translation reserve would be  transferred to pro/f_it and loss account upon sale or disposal  of the non-integral foreign operation and the amount  of gain/(loss) of ` (45) for year ended March 31, 2016  [2015: ` (134)] recognized in the hedging reserve would  be transferred to the statement of pro/f_it and loss on the  occurrence of the hedged transaction.
In accordance with AS 11, if the Company had continued  to recognize translation (losses)/ gains on foreign currency  borrowing in the statement of pro/f_it and loss:  a.
Foreign currency borrowing of USD 150 million and  EUR 77 million would not have been eligible as a  hedge instrument for hedge accounting and changes  in the fair value of the foreign currency borrowing  would have to be recognized in the statement of  pro/f_it and loss.
As a result pro/f_it after tax would have  been lower by ` 856 for the year ended March 31,  2016 (2015: lower by ` 390).

Capital commitments  The estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed  on Capital account and not provided for, net of advances is   ` 10,734 (2015: ` 1,262).

Contingent liabilities As at March 31, 2016 2015 Disputed demands for excise  duty, custom duty, sales tax  and other matters 2,654 2,560 Performance and financial  guarantee given by the banks  on behalf of the Company 25,218 21,235  The Company’s Indian operations have been established   as units in Special Economic Zone and Software Technology  Park Unit under plans formulated by the Government of  India.
As per the plan, the Company’s India operations  have export obligations to the extent of net positive  foreign exchange (i.e.
foreign exchange in/f_low - foreign  exchange out/f_low should be positive) over a /f_ive year  period.
The consequence of not meeting this commitment  in the future would be a retroactive levy of import duties  on certain hardware previously imported duty free.
As at  March 31, 2016, the Company believes that it has met all  the commitments substantially required under the plan  Tax Demands:  The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  (including tax assessment orders/ penalty notices) which  have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
Some  Consolidated Financial Statements under India GAAP Wipro Limited 205 of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible  to make a reasonable estimate of the expected /f_inancial  eﬀect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of  such proceedings.
However, the resolution of these legal  proceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse  eﬀect on the results of operations or the /f_inancial position  of the Company.
The significant of such matters are  discussed below.
In March 2004, the Company received a tax demand for  year ended March 31, 2001 arising primarily on account of  denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax  Act, 1961 (Act) in respect of pro/f_it earned by the Company’s  undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bangalore.
The  same issue was repeated in the successive assessments  for the years ended March 31, 2002 to March 31, 2011 and  the aggregate demand is /uni20B9 47,583 (including interest of /uni20B9  13,832).
The appeals /f_iled against the said demand before  the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of  the Company by the second appellate authority for the  years up to March 31, 2007.
Further appeals have been  /f_iled by the Income tax authorities before the Hon’ble High  Court.
The Hon’ble High Court has heard and disposed-oﬀ  majority of the issues in favor of the Company up to years  ended March 31, 2004.
On similar issues for years up to March 31, 2000, the  Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka has upheld the claim of  the Company under section 10A of the Act.
For the years  ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, the appeals are  pending before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal).
For years ended March 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, the  Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) allowed the claim of the  Company under section 10A of the Act.
The Income tax  authorities have /f_iled an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March 31, 2012, the Company received the  draft assessment order in March 2016 with a proposed  demand of /uni20B9 4,241 (including interest of /uni20B9 1,376), arising  primarily on account of section 10AA issues with respect  to exclusion from Export Turnover.
Company has /f_iled an  objection before DRP within the prescribed timelines.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the  order of the appellate authority/Hon’ble High Court of  Karnataka upholding the claims of the Company for earlier  years, the Company believes that the /f_inal outcome of the  above disputes should be in favor of the Company and  there should not be any material adverse impact on the  /f_inancial statements.

Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 224 Annual Report 2015-16 WIPRO LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated) 1.
The Company overview  Wipro Limited (“Wipro” or the “Parent Company”), together with  its subsidiaries (collectively, “the Company” or the “Group”) is a  leading India based provider of IT Services, including Business  Process Services (“BPS”), globally.
Effective as of March/uni00A0 31, 2013, the Group completed the  demerger of its consumer care and lighting, infrastructure  engineering and other non-IT business segments (collectively,  the “Diversi/f_ied Business”) into Wipro Enterprises (P) Limited  (formerly Wipro Enterprises Limited), a company incorporated  under the laws of India.
Wipro is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in India.
The address of its registered oﬃce is Wipro Limited,  Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore – 560 035, Karnataka,  India.
Wipro has its primary listing with Bombay Stock Exchange  and National Stock Exchange in India.
The Company’s American  Depository Shares representing equity shares are also listed  on the New York Stock Exchange.
These consolidated /f_inancial  statements were authorized for issue by the Audit Committee  on May/uni00A026, 2016.
2.
Basis of preparation of consolidated financial  statements  (i)  Statement of compliance and basis of preparation  The consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prepared in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  and its interpretations (“IFRS”), as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
Accounting policies have  been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  consolidated /f_inancial statements.
The consolidated financial statements correspond to the  classi/f_ication provisions contained in IAS 1(revised), “Presentation  of Financial Statements” .
For clarity, various items are aggregated  in the statements of income and statements of /f_inancial position.
These items are disaggregated separately in the notes to the  consolidated /f_inancial statements, where applicable.
All amounts included in the consolidated /f_inancial statements  are reported in millions of Indian rupees ( ` in millions) except  share and per share data, unless otherwise stated.
Due to  rounding oﬀ, the numbers presented throughout the document  may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not  precisely re/f_lect the absolute /f_igures.
(ii)  Basis of measurement  The consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prepared on  a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for  the following material items which have been measured at fair  value as required by relevant IFRS:-  a.
Derivative /f_inancial instruments;  b. Available-for-sale /f_inancial assets;  c. The de/f_ined bene/f_it asset/(liability) is recognised as the  present value of de/f_ined bene/f_it obligation less fair value  of plan assets; and  d. Contingent consideration.
(iii)  Convenience translation (unaudited)  The accompanying consolidated /f_inancial statements have been  prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the national currency of  India.
Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated  /f_inancial statements as of and for the year ended March/uni00A0 31,  2016, have been translated into United States dollars at the  certi/f_ied foreign exchange rate of US$1 = ` 66.25 as published  by Federal Reserve Board of Governors on March/uni00A031, 2016.
No  representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have  been, could have been or could be converted into United States  dollars at such a rate or any other rate.
Due to rounding oﬀ, the  translated numbers presented throughout the document may  not add up precisely to the totals.
(iv)  Use of estimates and judgment  The preparation of the consolidated /f_inancial statements in  conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may diﬀer from  those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized  in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future  periods aﬀected.
In particular, information about signi/f_icant  areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in  applying accounting policies that have the most signi/f_icant  eﬀect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated /f_inancial  statements are included in the following notes:  a) Revenue recognition: The Company uses the percentage of  completion method using the input (cost expended) method to  measure progress towards completion in respect of /f_ixed price  contracts.
Percentage of completion method accounting relies  on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs.
This  method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates  of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of  the contract can be made.
Key factors that are reviewed in  estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of  future labor costs and productivity eﬃciencies.
Because the  /f_inancial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts,  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 225 recognized revenue and pro/f_it are subject to revisions as the  contract progresses to completion.
When estimates indicate  that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the  period in which the loss becomes probable.
Volume discounts  are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
When the amount of  discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is  recorded based on estimate of future revenue from the customer.
b) Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate  that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is  less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of cash  generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost  to sell.
The calculation involves use of signi/f_icant estimates and  assumptions which includes turnover and earnings multiples,  growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future  cash /f_lows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and  market conditions.
c) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company  are India and the United States of America.
Signi/f_icant judgments  are involved in determining the provision for income taxes  including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of  being sustained in tax assessments.
A tax assessment can involve  complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time  periods.
d) Deferred taxes : Deferred tax is recorded on temporary  diﬀerences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted  or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The ultimate  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the  generation of future taxable pro/f_its during the periods in which  those temporary diﬀerences and tax loss carry-forwards become  deductible.
The Company considers the expected reversal of  deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in  making this assessment.
The amount of the deferred tax assets  considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near  term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry- forward period are reduced.
e) Business combination : In accounting for business  combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether  an identi/f_iable intangible asset is to be recorded separately  from goodwill.
Additionally, estimating the acquisition date  fair value of the identi/f_iable assets acquired, and liabilities and  contingent consideration involves management judgment.
These measurements are based on information available at the  acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions  that have been deemed reasonable by management.
Changes  in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially  aﬀect the results of operations.
f) De/f_ined bene/f_it plans: The cost of the de/f_ined bene/f_it plans  and the present value of the de/f_ined bene/f_it obligation are based  on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that may diﬀer from actual developments in the future.
These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates.
Due to the complexities involved  in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/f_ined bene/f_it  obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.
All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
g) Other estimates: The Company estimates the uncollectability  of accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns,  customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and  current economic trends.
If the /f_inancial condition of a customer  deteriorates, additional allowances may be required.
The stock  compensation expense is determined based on the Company’s  estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
Non-marketable equity investments are initially recorded  at cost and subsequently measured at fair value.
Fair value  of investments is determined using the market and income  approaches.
The market approach includes the use of /f_inancial  metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as revenue,  earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent /f_inancial  rounds and the level of marketability of the investments.
The  selection of comparable companies requires management  judgment and is based on a number of factors, including  comparable company sizes, growth rates, and development  stages.
The income approach includes the use of discounted  cash /f_low model, which requires signi/f_icant estimates regarding  the investees’ revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the  risk pro/f_ile of comparable companies.
Estimates of revenue and  costs are developed using available historical and forecast data.
3.
Signi/f_icant accounting policies  (i)  Basis of consolidation  Subsidiaries  The Company determines the basis of control in line with the  requirements of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group  controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to aﬀect those returns through its power over the  entity.
The /f_inancial statements of subsidiaries are included in  the consolidated /f_inancial statements from the date on which  control commences until the date on which control ceases.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest  Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill)  of consolidated subsidiaries are identi/f_ied separately from the  Company’s equity.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders  may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non- controlling interest’s proportionate share of the fair value of the  acquiree’s identi/f_iable net assets.
The choice of measurement  basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis.
Subsequent  to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest  is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 226 Annual Report 2015-16 Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling  interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having  a de/f_icit balance.
(ii)  Functional and presentation currency  Items included in the financial statements of each of the  Company’s entities are measured using the currency of the  primary economic environment in which these entities operate  (i.e.
the “functional currency”).
These consolidated /f_inancial  statements are presented in Indian rupees, the national currency  of India, which is the functional currency of the Company.
(iii)  Foreign currency transactions and translation  a)  Transactions and balances  Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the  respective functional currencies using the exchange rates  prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains  and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions  and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the  reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results of operating activities except when deferred in other  comprehensive income as qualifying cash /f_low hedges and  qualifying net investment hedges.
Gains/(losses) relating to  translation or settlement of borrowings denominated in foreign  currency are reported within /f_inance expense.
Non-monetary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and  measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate  prevalent at the date of transaction.
Translation diﬀerences on  non-monetary /f_inancial assets measured at fair value at the  reporting date, such as equities classi/f_ied as available for sale are  included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
b)  Foreign operations  For the purpose of presenting consolidated /f_inancial statements,  the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations  that have a functional currency other than Indian rupees are  translated into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing at  the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at  the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange diﬀerences  arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income  and held in foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a  component of equity, except to the extent that the translation  diﬀerence is allocated to non-controlling interest.
When a foreign  operation is disposed oﬀ, the relevant amount recognized in  FCTR is transferred to the statement of income as part of the  pro/f_it or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments  arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as  assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at  the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
c)  Others  Foreign currency differences arising on the translation or  settlement of a /f_inancial liability designated as a hedge of a  net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in other  comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR  to the extent the hedge is eﬀective.
To the extent the hedge is  ineﬀective, such diﬀerences are recognized in the statement  of income.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of,  the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the  statement of income as part of the pro/f_it or loss on disposal.
Foreign currency differences arising from translation of  intercompany receivables or payables relating to foreign  operations, the settlement of which is neither planned nor  likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of  net investment in foreign operation and are recognized in FCTR.
(iv)  Financial instruments  a)  Non-derivative /f_inancial instruments  Non derivative /f_inancial instruments consist of:  • /f_inancial assets, which include cash and cash equivalents,  trade receivables, unbilled revenues, finance lease  receivables, employee and other advances, investments  in equity and debt securities and eligible current and non- current assets;  • /f_inancial liabilities, which include long and short-term loans  and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payables, eligible  current and non-current liabilities.
Non derivative /f_inancial instruments are recognized initially at  fair value.
Financial assets are derecognized when substantial  risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have  been transferred.
In cases where substantial risks and rewards  of ownership of the financial assets are neither transferred  nor retained, /f_inancial assets are derecognized only when the  Company has not retained control over the /f_inancial asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial  instruments are measured as described below:  A.
Cash and cash equivalents  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on  hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which  can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty  on the principal.
For the purposes of the cash /f_low statement, cash and cash  equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits  with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable  on demand and are considered part of the Company’s cash  management system.
In the consolidated statement of /f_inancial  position, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within  current liabilities.
B.  Available-for-sale /f_inancial assets  The Company has classi/f_ied investments in liquid mutual funds,  equity securities and certain debt securities (primarily certi/f_icate  of deposits with banks) as available-for-sale /f_inancial assets.
These investments are measured at fair value and changes  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 227 therein, other than impairment losses, are recognized in other  comprehensive income and presented within equity, net of taxes.
The impairment losses, if any, are reclassi/f_ied from equity into  statement of income.
When an available for sale /f_inancial asset  is derecognized, the related cumulative gain or loss recognised  in equity is transferred to the statement of income.
C.  Loans and receivables  Loans and receivables are non-derivative /f_inancial assets with  /f_ixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active  market.
They are presented as current assets, except for those  maturing later than 12 months after the reporting date which  are presented as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are  initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured  at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less  any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise trade  receivables, unbilled revenues, cash and cash equivalents and  other assets.
D.  Trade and other payables  Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value,  and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the eﬀective  interest method.
For these /f_inancial instruments, the carrying  amounts approximate fair value due to the short term maturity  of these instruments.
b)  Derivative /f_inancial instruments  The Company is exposed to foreign currency /f_luctuations on  foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign  operations and forecasted cash /f_lows denominated in foreign  currency.
The Company limits the effect of foreign exchange rate  /f_luctuations by following established risk management policies  including the use of derivatives.
The Company enters into  derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is  primarily a bank.
Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value.
Attributable transaction costs are recognized in statement of  income as cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative /f_inancial instruments  are measured as described below:  A.
Cash /f_low hedges  Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument  designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other  comprehensive income and held in cash /f_low hedging reserve,  net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge  is eﬀective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineﬀective, changes in  fair value are recognized in the statement of income and reported  within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results from  operating activities.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets  the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively.
If the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss  on the hedging instrument recognized in cash /f_low hedging  reserve till the period the hedge was eﬀective remains in cash  /f_low hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash  /f_low hedging reserve is transferred to the statement of income  upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction.
If  the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, such  cumulative balance is immediately recognized in the statement  of income.
B.  Hedges of net investment in foreign operations  The Company designates derivative /f_inancial instruments as  hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Company  has also designated a combination of foreign currency  denominated borrowings and related cross-currency swaps as a  hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
Changes in the fair  value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/(losses)  on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign  operations are recognized in other comprehensive income  and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that the  hedge is eﬀective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineﬀective,  changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results from operating activities.
C.  Others  Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  neither designated as cash flow hedges nor hedges of net  investment in foreign operations are recognized in the statement  of income and reported within foreign exchange gains, net  within results from operating activities.
Changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign  currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which  have not been designated as hedges are recorded in /f_inance  expense.
(v)  Equity and share capital  a)  Share capital and share premium  The authorized share capital of the Company as of March/uni00A031, 2015  and 2016 is ` 6,100 million divided into 2,917,500,000 equity  shares of ` 2 each, 25,000,000 preference shares of ` 10 each  and 150,000 10% optionally convertible cumulative preference  shares of ` 100 each.
Par value of the equity shares is recorded  as share capital and the amount received in excess of par value  is classi/f_ied as share premium.
Every holder of the equity shares, as re/f_lected in the records of the  Company as of the date of the shareholder meeting shall have  one vote in respect of each share held for all matters submitted  to vote in the shareholder meeting.
b)  Shares held by controlled trust (Treasury shares)  The Company’s equity shares held by the controlled trust, which  is consolidated as a part of the Group are classi/f_ied as Treasury  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 228 Annual Report 2015-16 shares.
The Company has 16,640,212, 14,829,824 and 14,829,824  treasury shares as of March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Treasury shares are recorded at acquisition cost.
c)  Retained earnings  Retained earnings comprises of the Company’s undistributed  earnings after taxes.
A portion of these earnings amounting to  `/uni00A01,139 is not freely available for distribution.
d)  Share based payment reserve  The share based payment reserve is used to record the value  of equity-settled share based payment transactions with  employees.
The amounts recorded in share based payment  reserve are transferred to share premium upon exercise of stock  options and restricted stock unit options by employees.
e)  Cash /f_low hedging reserve  Changes in fair value of derivative hedging instruments  designated and eﬀective as a cash /f_low hedge are recognized  in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented  within equity as cash /f_low hedging reserve.
f)  Foreign currency translation reserve  The exchange diﬀerences arising from the translation of /f_inancial  statements of foreign subsidiaries, differences arising from  translation of long-term inter-company receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, changes in fair value of the  derivative hedging instruments and gains/(losses) on translation  or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings  designated as hedge of net investment in foreign operations  are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and  presented within equity in the FCTR.
g)  Other reserves  Changes in the fair value of available for sale financial  assets, other than impairment loss, is recognized in other  comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented within  equity in other reserves.
h)  Dividend  A final dividend, including tax thereon, on common stock  is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the  shareholders.
An interim dividend, including tax thereon, is  recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board  of directors.
(vi)  Property, plant and equipment  a)  Recognition and measurement  Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Cost  includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition  of the asset.
General and specific borrowing costs directly  attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset are  capitalized as part of the cost.
b)  Depreciation  The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over  the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis from the date  the assets are available for use.
Assets acquired under /f_inance  lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the  shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease  term.
Term licenses are amortized over their respective contract  term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful  life of assets are reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted,  annually.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:  Category Useful life /uni00A0 Buildings 28 to 40 years Plant and machinery 5 to 21 years Computer, equipment and software 2 to 7 years Furniture, /f_ixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Vehicles 4 to 5 years When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have diﬀerent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and  equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with these will flow to the  Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Deposits and advances paid towards the acquisition of property,  plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date and  the cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use  before such date are disclosed under capital work- in-progress.
(vii)  Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible assets  a)  Business combination  Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase  (acquisition) method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured  as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or  assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange  by the Company.
Identi/f_iable assets acquired and liabilities  and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination  are measured initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business  acquisition are expensed as incurred.
The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any  contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition.
Any subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent  consideration classi/f_ied as liabilities, other than measurement  period adjustments, are recognized in the consolidated  statement of income.
b)  Goodwill  The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company’s share  in the fair value of the acquiree’s identi/f_iable assets, liabilities and  contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill.
If the excess is  negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in  the statement of income.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 229 c)  Intangible assets  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of  acquisition.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination  are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following  initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any.
The amortisation of an intangible asset with a /f_inite useful life  re/f_lects the manner in which the economic bene/f_it is expected to  be generated and is included in selling and marketing expenses  in the consolidated statements of income.
The estimated useful life of amortizable intangibles are reviewed  and where appropriate are adjusted, annually.
The estimated  useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current  and comparative periods are as follows:  Category Useful life  Customer-related intangibles 5/uni00A0to/uni00A010/uni00A0years Marketing related intangibles 3/uni00A0to/uni00A010 years (viii) Leases  The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains,  a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the  inception date.
The arrangement is, or contains a lease if,  ful/f_illment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  speci/f_ic asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to  use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly speci/f_ied  in an arrangement.
a)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessee  Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Company  assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are  classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at lower  of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of  the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned  between the /f_inance charge and the outstanding liability.
The  /f_inance charge is allocated to periods during the lease term at  a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance  of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classi/f_ied as operating leases.
Payments  made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of  income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessor  In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross /f_inance receivables, unearned income  and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment on  consummation of such leases.
Unearned income represents the  excess of the gross /f_inance lease receivable plus the estimated  residual value over the sales price of the equipment.
The  Company recognizes unearned income as /f_inance income over  the lease term using the eﬀective interest method.
(ix)  Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost is  determined using the weighted average method.
(x)  Impairment  a)  Financial assets  The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there  is any objective evidence that a /f_inancial asset or a group of  /f_inancial assets is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the amount of impairment loss.
A.
Loans and receivables  Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized  using separate allowance accounts.
Refer Note 2 (iv)/uni00A0 (g)/uni00A0 for  further information regarding the determination of impairment.
B.
Available for sale /f_inancial assets  When the fair value of available-for-sale /f_inancial assets declines  below acquisition cost and there is objective evidence that  the asset is impaired, the cumulative gain/loss that has been  recognized in other comprehensive income, a component of  equity in other reserves is transferred to the statement of income.
An impairment loss may be reversed in subsequent periods, if  the indicators for the impairment no longer exist.
Such reversals  are recognized in other comprehensive income.
b)  Non /f_inancial assets  The Company assesses long-lived assets such as property, plant,  equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not  be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of  assets.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating  unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) and  its value-in-use (VIU).
If the recoverable amount of the asset  or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to  which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the  carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The  reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized  in the statement of income.
If at the reporting date, there is an  indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer  exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment  losses previously recognized are reversed such that the asset is  recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written  down value which would have been reported if the impairment  losses had not been recognized initially.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same  time and when events occur or changes in circumstances  indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating  unit is less than its carrying value.
The goodwill impairment test  is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of  cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 230 Annual Report 2015-16 goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
An  impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
(xi)  Employee bene/f_its  a)  Post-employment and pension plans  The Group participates in various employee benefit plans.
Pensions and other post-employment bene/f_its are classi/f_ied as  either de/f_ined contribution plans or de/f_ined bene/f_it plans.
Under  a de/f_ined contribution plan, the Company’s only obligation  is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further  contributions if the fund does not hold suﬃcient assets to pay  all employee bene/f_its.
The related actuarial and investment risks  fall on the employee.
The expenditure for de/f_ined contribution  plans is recognized as an expense during the period when the  employee provides service.
Under a de/f_ined bene/f_it plan, it is  the Company’s obligation to provide agreed bene/f_its to the  employees.
The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the  Company.
The present value of the de/f_ined bene/f_it obligations  is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
During the year ended March/uni00A031, 2014, the Company had applied  IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) Employee Bene/f_its and the  related consequential amendments.
IAS 19R has been applied  retrospectively in accordance with transitional provisions.
As a  result, all actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized  in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and permanently  excluded from pro/f_it or loss.
Further, the pro/f_it or loss will no  longer include an expected return on plan assets.
Instead net  interest recognized in pro/f_it or loss is calculated by applying the  discount rate used to measure the de/f_ined bene/f_it obligation to  the net de/f_ined bene/f_it liability or asset.
The actual return on the  plan assets above or below the discount rate is recognized as  part of re-measurement of net de/f_ined liability or asset through  other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
The Company has the following employee bene/f_it plans:  A.  Provident fund  Employees receive bene/f_its from a provident fund, which is a  de/f_ined bene/f_it plan.
The employer and employees each make  periodic contributions to the plan.
A portion of the contribution  is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the  Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to  the government administered pension fund.
The contributions  to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a  de/f_ined bene/f_it plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall  in the fund assets based on the government speci/f_ied minimum  rates of return.
B.  Superannuation  Superannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is  administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI  Prudential Insurance Company Limited.
The Company makes  annual contributions based on a speci/f_ied percentage of each  eligible employee’s salary.
C.  Gratuity  In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, applicable  for Indian companies, the Company provides for a lump sum  payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination  of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of  employment with the Company.
The gratuity fund is managed  by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), HDFC Standard  Life, TATA AIG and Birla Sun-life.
The Company’s obligation in  respect of the gratuity plan, which is a de/f_ined bene/f_it plan, is  provided for based on actuarial valuation using the projected  unit credit method.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains and  losses immediately in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
b)  Termination bene/f_its  Termination bene/f_its are expensed when the Company can no  longer withdraw the oﬀer of those bene/f_its.
c)  Short-term bene/f_its  Short-term employee bene/f_it obligations are measured on an  undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related  service is provided.
A liability is recognized for the amount  expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or pro/f_it- sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive  obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided  by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
d)  Compensated absences  The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated  absences.
The employees can carry forward a portion of the  unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it  in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination  of employment.
The Company records an obligation for  compensated absences in the period in which the employee  renders the services that increases this entitlement.
The  Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences  as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a  result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end  of the reporting period.
The Company recognizes accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the  projected unit credit method.
Non-accumulating compensated  absences are recognized in the period in which the absences  occur.
(xii)  Share based payment transactions  Selected employees of the Company receive remuneration in  the form of equity settled instruments, for rendering services  over a de/f_ined vesting period.
Equity instruments granted are  measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the  date of grant.
In cases, where equity instruments are granted at  a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant  approximates the fair value.
The expense is recognized in the  statement of income with a corresponding increase to the share  based payment reserve, a component of equity.
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded manner over  the vesting period.
The fair value determined at the grant date is  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 231 expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of  such grants (accelerated amortisation).
The stock compensation  expense is determined based on the Company’s estimate of  equity instruments that will eventually vest.
(xiii)/uni00A0 Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an out/f_low of economic bene/f_its will be required  to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of  the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of  the consideration required to settle the present obligation at  the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When some or all of the economic bene/f_its required to settle a  provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the  receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that  reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable  can be measured reliably.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the  expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a  contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the  future obligations under the contract.
Provisions for onerous  contracts are measured at the present value of lower of the  expected net cost of ful/f_illing the contract and the expected  cost of terminating the contract.
(xiv)  Revenue  The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware and related  services, business process services, sale of IT and other products.
a)  Services  The Company recognizes revenue when the signi/f_icant terms of  the arrangement are enforceable, services have been delivered  and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method for  recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the  services rendered:  A.
Time and materials contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are  recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized using  the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage of  completion is determined based on project costs incurred to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required  to complete the project.
The cost expended (or input) method  has been used to measure progress towards completion as  there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
If the Company does not have a suﬃcient basis to measure  the progress of completion or to estimate the total contract  revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent  of contract cost incurred for which recoverability is probable.
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of income  in the period in which such losses become probable based on  the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ represent cost and earnings in excess of  billings as at the end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned revenues’  represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.
Advance  payments received from customers for which no services have  been rendered are presented as ‘Advance from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over  the period of the contract using the percentage of completion  method.
When services are performed through an inde/f_inite  number of repetitive acts over a speci/f_ied period of time, revenue is  recognized on a straight-line basis over the speci/f_ied period unless  some other method better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a /f_ixed quantum of service or output units is  agreed at a /f_ixed price for a /f_ixed term.
In such contracts, revenue  is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved till  date as a percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual  service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on  completion of the term.
b)  Products  Revenue from products are recognized when the signi/f_icant risks  and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer,  continuing managerial involvement usually associated with  ownership and eﬀective control have ceased, the amount of  revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic  bene/f_its associated with the transaction will /f_low to the Company  and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the  transaction can be measured reliably.
c)  Multiple element arrangements  Revenue from contracts with multiple-element arrangements  are recognized using the guidance in IAS 18, Revenue.
The  Company allocates the arrangement consideration to separately  identifiable components based on their relative fair values  or on the residual method.
Fair values are determined based  on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold  separately, third-party prices for similar components or cost  plus an appropriate business-speci/f_ic pro/f_it margin related to  the relevant component.
d)  Others  • The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing  incentives to customers by reducing the amount of revenue  recognized at the time of sale.
• Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value added tax,  service tax and applicable discounts and allowances.
Revenue includes excise duty.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 232 Annual Report 2015-16 • The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at  the time when the revenue is recognized.
The accruals are  based on the Company’s historical experience of material  usage and service delivery costs.
• Costs that relate directly to a contract and incurred  in securing a contract are recognized as an asset and  amortized over the contract term.
• Contract expenses are recognised as expenses by reference  to the stage of completion of contract activity at the end  of the reporting period.
(xv)  Finance expenses  Finance expenses comprise interest cost on borrowings,  impairment losses recognized on /f_inancial assets, gains/(losses)  on translation or settlement of foreign currency borrowings and  changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of related  derivative instruments.
Borrowing costs that are not directly  attributable to a qualifying asset are recognized in the statement  of income using the eﬀective interest method.
(xvi)  Finance and other income  Finance and other income comprises interest income on  deposits, dividend income and gains/(losses) on disposal of  available-for-sale /f_inancial assets.
Interest income is recognized  using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is  recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
(xvii) Income tax  Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax  expense is recognized in the statement of income except to  the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly  recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.
a)  Current income tax  Current income tax for the current and prior periods are  measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or  paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income  for the period.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the  current tax amount are those that are enacted or substantively  enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period.
The Company oﬀsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to set oﬀ the recognized  amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or  to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.
b)  Deferred income tax  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet  approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are  recognized for deductible and taxable temporary diﬀerences  arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amount in /f_inancial statements, except when  the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of  goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and aﬀects neither accounting nor taxable  pro/f_its or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent it is  probable that taxable pro/f_it will be available against which  the deductible temporary diﬀerences and the carry forward of  unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary diﬀerences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal  of the temporary diﬀerence can be controlled and it is probable  that the temporary diﬀerence will not reverse in the foreseeable  future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that suﬃcient taxable pro/f_it will be available to  allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset  is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date.
The Company oﬀsets deferred income tax assets and liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to oﬀset current tax assets  against current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by  the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity, or  on diﬀerent taxable entities where there is an intention to settle  the current tax liabilities and assets on a/uni00A0net basis or their tax  assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
(xviii) Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted  for treasury shares held.
Diluted earnings per share is computed  using the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive  equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the  treasury stock method for options and warrants, except where  the results would be anti-dilutive.
(xix) Discontinued operations  A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’s  business that represents a separate line of business that has  been disposed oﬀ or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired  exclusively with a view to resale.
Classi/f_ication as a discontinued  operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the  operation meets the criteria to be classi/f_ied as held for sale.
New Accounting standards adopted by the Company:  The Company has, with eﬀect from April/uni00A01, 2015, adopted the  Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Bene/f_its/uni00A0–/uni00A0clari/f_ications on  assessment of existence of deep market based on currency instead  of geography.
The adoption of this amendment did not have  any material impact on the consolidated /f_inancial statements  of the Company.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 233 New accounting standards not yet adopted:  A number of new standards, amendments to standards and  interpretations are not yet eﬀective for annual periods beginning  after 1/uni00A0 April 2015, and have not been applied in preparing  these consolidated financial statements.
New standards,  amendments to standards and interpretations that could have  potential impact on the consolidated /f_inancial statements of  the Company are:  IFRS 9 – Financial instruments  In July 2014, the IASB completed its project to replace IAS  39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement by  publishing the final version of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments.
IFRS 9 introduces a single approach for the classification and  measurement of financial assets according to their cash flow  characteristics and the business model they are managed in,  and provides a new impairment model based on expected  credit losses.
IFRS 9 also includes new guidance regarding  the application of hedge accounting to better reflect an  entity’s risk management activities especially with regard to  managing non-financial risks.
The new standard is effective  for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01,  2018, while early application is permitted.
The Company  has elected to early adopt IFRS 9 effective April/uni00A01, 2016.
The  Company does not expect a significant impact on its balance  sheet or equity on applying the classification, measurement  and presentation requirements of IFRS 9.
It expects to  continue measuring at fair value all /f_inancial assets currently  held at fair value.
The Company believes that all existing hedge  relationships that are currently designated as eﬀective hedging  relationships will still qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9.
As IFRS 9 does not change the general principles of how an entity  accounts for eﬀective hedges, the Company does not expect a  signi/f_icant impact as a result of applying IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 15 supersedes all existing revenue requirements in IFRS  (IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related  interpretations).
According to the new standard, revenue is  recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services  to a customer in an amount that re/f_lects the consideration to  which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those  goods or services.
IFRS 15 establishes a /f_ive step model that will  apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with  limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction  or the industry.
Extensive disclosures will be required, including  disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance  obligation; changes in contract asset and liability account  balances between periods and key judgments and estimates.
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or  cumulative eﬀect transition method.
In September 2015, the  IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 15, deferring the adoption  of the standard to periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2018.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS  15 on the Company’s consolidated /f_inancial statements.
IFRS 16 – Leases  On January/uni00A013, 2016, the International Accounting Standards  Board issued the /f_inal version of IFRS 16, Leases.
IFRS 16 will  replace the existing leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related  interpretations.
The standard sets out the principles for the  recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of  leases.
IFRS 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and  requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases  with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset  is of low value.
The Standard also contains enhanced disclosure  requirements for lessees.
The eﬀective date for adoption of  IFRS 16 is annual periods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2019,  though early adoption is permitted for companies applying  IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Company  is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 16 on the  Company’s consolidated /f_inancial statements.

(“HealthPlan Services”).
Also refer note 6 to the consolidated  /f_inancial statements.
The Company is organized by two operating segments: IT  Services and IT Products.
Goodwill as at March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016 has been allocated to  the following operating segments:  Segments As at March/uni00A031, /uni00A0 2015 /uni00A02016 IT Services ` 67,394 ` 101,991  IT Products 684 —/uni00A0/uni00A0  Total ` 68,078 ` 101,991  Eﬀective April/uni00A01, 2015, the carrying value of goodwill allocated  to the CGU within IT Products segment has been reallocated  to the Global Media and Telecom (GMT) CGU within IT Services  segment, in line with a change in method of evaluating the  underlying asset’s performance.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill relating to IT  Services segment has been allocated to the CGUs as follows:  CGUs As at March/uni00A031, /uni00A0 2015 /uni00A02016 Banking Financial Services and  Insurance (BFSI) ` 14,015 ` 15,639  Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) 14,080 38,096 Retail, Consumer, Transport and  Government (RCTG) 9,426 10,712 Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities  (ENU) 15,768 16,550 Manufacturing and High-Tech (MFG) 11,644 16,242 Global Media and Telecom (GMT) 2,461 4,752 Total ` 67,394 ` 101,991  Goodwill/uni00A0is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance  with the Company’s procedure for determining the recoverable  value of such assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing,  goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level  within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal  management purposes, and which is not higher than the  Company’s operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU within IT Services segment is  determined on the basis of Fair Value Less Cost To Sell (FVLCTS).
The FVLCTS of the CGU is determined based on the market  capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings  multiples derived from observable market data.
The fair value  measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the  inputs in the valuation techniques used.
For the year ended March/uni00A0 31, 2015, the carrying value of  goodwill allocated to the CGU within IT Products segment is not  signi/f_icant.
The recoverable value of this CGU was determined  using value-in-use.
The VIU is determined based on discounted  cash /f_low projections.
Key assumptions on which the Company  had based its determination of VIU include estimated cash /f_lows,  terminal value and discount rates.
Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions.
The use  of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that  is materially diﬀerent from the value-in-use that would result if  the calculation was performed using before tax assumptions.
The  before tax discount rate is determined based on the value-in-use  derived from the use of after tax assumptions.
Assumptions Y ear/uni00A0ended/uni00A0  March/uni00A031, /uni00A0 2015 /uni00A0 Terminal value long-term growth rate 5% After tax discount rate 16.5% Before tax discount rate 24.9% Based on the above, no impairment was identified as of  March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016 as the recoverable value of the CGUs  exceeded the carrying value.
Further, none of the CGU’s tested  for impairment as of March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016 were at risk  of impairment.
An analysis of the calculation’s sensitivity to  a change in the key parameters (revenue growth, operating  margin, discount rate and long-term growth rate) based on  reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable  scenarios where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below  its carrying amount.

Business combination  Summary of acquisition during the year ended March/uni00A031,  2014 is given below:  Opus Capital Markets Consultants LLC  On January/uni00A014, 2014, the Company had obtained control of Opus  Capital Markets Consultants LLC (“Opus”) by acquiring 100% of  its share capital.
Opus is a US-based provider of mortgage due  diligence and risk management services.
The acquisition has  strengthened Wipro’s mortgage solutions and complemented  our existing oﬀerings in mortgage origination, servicing and  secondary market.
The acquisition was executed through a share purchase agreement  for a consideration of ` 4,589 (US$ 75 million) which included  a deferred earn-out component of ` 1,285 (US$ 21 million),  dependent on achievement of revenues and earnings targets over a  period of 3 years.
This earn-out liability was fair valued at ` 782 and  recorded as part of preliminary purchase price allocation.
During the year ended March/uni00A031, 2015, the Company concluded  the fair value adjustments of the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed on acquisition.
Consequently, the fair value of earn- out liability was recorded at ` 589.
Comparatives have not been  retrospectively revised as the amounts are not material.

Goodwill is not expected to be  deductible for income tax purposes.
During the year ended March/uni00A031, 2015, the fair value of earn- out liability was determined to be ` 144 as a result of changes  in estimates of revenue and earnings over the earn-out period.
The revision of the estimates has inter alia resulted in reduction  in the carrying value of intangibles recognized on acquisition.
Accordingly, a net gain of ` 470 has been recorded in the  statement of income.
The fair value of earn-out consideration was estimated by  applying the Discounted Cash Flow approach.
The fair value  estimates are based on discount rate of 7% and probability  adjusted revenue and earnings estimates.
If the acquisition had occurred on April/uni00A01, 2013, management  estimates that consolidated revenue and pro/f_it after taxes for  the year ended March/uni00A0 31, 2014 would have been ` 436,563  and ` 78,748 respectively.
The pro-forma amounts are not  necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred  if the acquisition had occurred on date indicated or that may  result in the future.
Summary of acquisition during the year ended March/uni00A031,  2015 is given below:  ATCO I-Tek Inc.  On August/uni00A0 15, 2014, the Company obtained control of ATCO  I-Tek Inc, a Canadian entity, by acquiring 100% of its share  capital and certain assets of IT services business of ATCO I-Tek  Australia (hereafter the acquisitions are collectively referred to  as ‘acquisition of ATCO I-Tek’) for an all-cash consideration of `  11,071 (Canadian Dollars 198 million) post conclusion of closing  conditions and fair value adjustments.
ATCO I-Tek provides IT  services to ATCO Group.
The acquisition will strengthen Wipro’s  IT services delivery model in North America and Australia.

Goodwill is not deductible for  income tax purposes.
If the acquisition had occurred on April/uni00A01, 2014, management  estimates that consolidated revenue and pro/f_it after taxes for  the year ended March/uni00A0 31, 2015 would have been ` 472,142  and ` 87,503 respectively.
The pro-forma amounts are not  necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred  if the acquisition had occurred on date indicated or that may  result in the future.

Fair value  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,  unbilled revenues, trade payables, current /f_inancial liabilities and  borrowings approximate their carrying amount largely due to  the short-term nature of these instruments.
A substantial portion  of the Company’s long-term debt has been contracted at /f_loating  rates of interest, which are reset at short intervals.
Accordingly,  the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair  value.

Based on this evaluation, the Company records  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 244 Annual Report 2015-16 allowance for estimated losses on these receivables.

Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with  market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign  exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option  contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques  include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models  (for option valuation), using present value calculations.
The  models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality  of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates,  interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying.
As at March/uni00A031, 2016, the changes in counterparty credit risk  had no material eﬀect on the hedge eﬀectiveness assessment  for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other  /f_inancial instruments recognized at fair value.
Available for sale investments (Investment in certificate of  deposits and commercial papers): Fair value of available-for-sale  /f_inancial assets is derived based on the indicative quotes of price  and yields prevailing in the market as on March/uni00A031, 2016.
Available for sale investments (Investment in liquid and short- term mutual funds): Fair valuation is derived based on Net Asset  value published by the respective mutual fund houses.

Sale of /f_inancial assets  From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company  transfers accounts receivables, unbilled revenues, net investment  in /f_inance lease receivables (/f_inancials assets) to banks.
Under the  terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over  the /f_inancial assets and transfer is without recourse.
Accordingly,  such transfers are recorded as sale of /f_inancial assets.
Gains and  losses on sale of /f_inancial assets without recourse are recorded  at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the /f_inancial  assets and fair value of servicing liability.
In certain cases, transfer of /f_inancial assets may be with recourse.
Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated  to repurchase the uncollected /f_inancial assets, subject to limits  speci/f_ied in the agreement with the banks.
These are re/f_lected  as part of loans and borrowings in the statement of /f_inancial  position.
The incremental impact of such transaction on our  cash /f_low and liquidity for the years ended March/uni00A031, 2015 and  2016 is not material.
Financial risk management  General  Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or  to future cash /f_lows that may result from a change in the price  of a /f_inancial instrument.
The value of a /f_inancial instrument  may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign  currency exchange rates and other market changes that aﬀect  market risk sensitive instruments.
Market risk is attributable to all  market risk sensitive /f_inancial instruments including investments,  foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.
The Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of  investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating  activities in foreign currency.
The objective of market risk  management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company’s  earnings and equity to losses.
Risk Management Procedures  The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury  department, which evaluates and exercises independent control  over the entire process of market risk management.
The corporate  treasury department recommends risk management objectives  and policies, which are approved by senior management and  Audit Committee.
The activities of this department include  management of cash resources, implementing hedging  strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies,  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.
Foreign currency risk  The Company operates internationally and a major portion of  its business is transacted in several currencies.
Consequently,  the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through  receiving payment for sales and services in the United States  and elsewhere, and making purchases from overseas suppliers  in various foreign currencies.
The exchange rate risk primarily  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 247 arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances,  forecasted cash /f_lows, payables and foreign currency loans and  borrowings.
A signi/f_icant portion of the Company’s revenue is in  the U.S./uni00A0Dollar, the United Kingdom Pound/uni00A0Sterling, the Euro, the  Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion  of costs are in Indian rupees.
The exchange rate between the  rupee and these currencies has /f_luctuated signi/f_icantly in recent  years and may continue to /f_luctuate in the future.
Appreciation  of the rupee against these currencies can adversely aﬀect the  Company’s results of operations.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from  these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative  instruments to mitigate such exposure.
The Company follows  established risk management policies, including the use of  derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to  hedge forecasted cash /f_lows denominated in foreign currency.
The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as  cash /f_low hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure  of forecasted highly probable cash /f_lows.
The Company has  also designated foreign currency borrowings as hedge against  respective net investments in foreign operations.
As of March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016 respectively, a ` 1 increase/ decrease in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the  U.S. dollar would result in approximately ` 1,495 and ` 1,398  decrease/increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar  denominated derivative instruments.
The below table presents foreign currency risk from non-derivative /f_inancial instruments as of March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016:  /uni00A0 As at March 31, 2015 US$ /uni00A0 Euro /uni00A0Pound  Sterling  Australian  Dollar  Canadian  Dollar /uni00A0 Other  currencies# /uni00A0 Total /uni00A0 Trade receivables `   29,586 `   4,648 `   8,603 `  1,376 `     211 `  3,005 `    47,429 Unbilled revenues 16,430 2,855 5,099 915 196 1,292 26,787 Cash and cash equivalents 40,465 1,098 842 255 26 2,100 44,786 Other assets 1,393 1,241 308 1,782 12 218 4,954 Loans and borrowings `  (58,750) `       —/uni00A0/uni00A0 `    (360) `   (932) `       —/uni00A0/uni00A0`   (227) `  (60,269)  Trade payables, accrued  expenses and other liabilities (22,296) (2,923) (4,149) (797) (119) (1,571) (31,855) Net assets / (liabilities) `     6,828 `   6,919 `  10,343 `  2,599 `    326 `  4,817 `   31,832 /uni00A0 As at March 31, 2016 US$ /uni00A0 Euro /uni00A0Pound  Sterling  Australian  Dollar  Canadian  Dollar /uni00A0 Other  currencies# /uni00A0 Total /uni00A0 Trade receivables `   34,284 `   3,836 `   6,891 `  1,754 `    419 `  3,023 `   50,207  Unbilled revenues  19,578  4,330  4,458  1,780  258  1,398  31,802  Cash and cash equivalents  46,426  2,361  47  362  43  1,403  50,642  Other assets  1,810  1,071  44  2,091  14  171  5,201  Loans and borrowings ` (65,180)  ` (6,109) `   (221) `  (776) `      —/uni00A0/uni00A0   `      —/uni00A0/uni00A0  ` (72,286) Trade payables, accrued  expenses and other liabilities  (18,869)  (4,339)  (4,788)  (1,417)  (149)  (1,702)  (31,264) Net assets / (liabilities) `   18,049 `  1,150 `   6,431 `  3,794 `    585 `  4,293 `  34,302  #/uni00A0 Other currencies re/f_lect currencies such as Singapore Dollars, Saudi Arabian Riyals etc.

Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk primarily arises from /f_loating rate borrowing,  including various revolving and other lines of credit.
The  Company’s investments are primarily in short-term investments,  which do not expose it to signi/f_icant interest rate risk.
The  Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating  to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements,  which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a  notional amount and agreed upon /f_ixed and /f_loating interest  rates.
As of March/uni00A031, 2016, substantially all of the Company’s  borrowings were subject to /f_loating interest rates, which reset  at short intervals.
If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps  from March/uni00A031, 2016, additional net annual interest expense on  /f_loating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ` 1,102.  Credit risk  Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not  be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this,  the Company periodically assesses the /f_inancial reliability of  customers, taking into account the /f_inancial condition, current  economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of  accounts receivable.
Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
No  single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts  receivable as of March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively and  revenues for the year ended March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015 and 2016,  respectively.
There is no signi/f_icant concentration of credit risk.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 248 Annual Report 2015-16 Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired  Cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale /f_inancial assets,  investment in certificates of deposits and interest bearing  deposits with corporates are neither past due nor impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents with banks and interest-bearing  deposits are placed with corporate, which have high credit- ratings assigned by international and domestic credit-rating  agencies.
Available-for-sale financial assets substantially  include investment in liquid mutual fund units.
Certi/f_icates of  deposit represent funds deposited with banks or other /f_inancial  institutions for a speci/f_ied time period.
Financial assets that are past due but not impaired  There is no other class of /f_inancial assets that is past due but  not impaired except for receivables of ` 5,510 and ` 7,305 as of  March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Of the total receivables,   ` 67,997 and ` 74,200 as of March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016, respectively,  were neither past due nor impaired.
The Company’s credit period  generally ranges from 45-60 days from invoicing date.
The aging  analysis of the receivables has been considered from the date  the invoice falls due.
The age wise break up of receivables, net  of allowances that are past due, is given below:  /uni00A0 As at March/uni00A031,  /uni00A0 2015 2016 Financial assets that are neither past  due nor impaired /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0` 67,997 /uni00A0` 74,200  Financial assets that are past due but  not impaired  Past due 0 – 30 days 7,343 7,924  Past due 31 – 60 days 3,936 3,959  Past due 61 – 90 days 2,876 2,980  Past due over 90 days 16,307 18,728 Total past due but not impaired ` 30,462 ` 33,591 Counterparty risk  Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable  securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market  contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits.
Issuer risk is  minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated  in India based on Indian rating agencies.
Settlement and credit  risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with  counterparties that are usually banks or /f_inancial institutions  with acceptable credit ratings.
Exposure to these risks are closely  monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters.
There are limits on credit exposure to any /f_inancial institution.
The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon  credit analysis including financial statements and capital  adequacy ratio reviews.
Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will  not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a  reasonable price.
The Company’s corporate treasury department  is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement  management.
In addition, processes and policies related to  such risks are overseen by senior management.
Management  monitors the Company’s net liquidity position through rolling  forecasts on the basis of expected cash /f_lows.
As of March/uni00A031,  2016, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and  /f_inancial institutions.
The table below provides details regarding the remaining  contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at  the reporting date.

Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 250 Annual Report 2015-16 Deferred taxes on unrealized foreign exchange gain / loss  relating to cash /f_low hedges, fair value movements in available  for sale of investments and actuarial gains/losses on de/f_ined  bene/f_it plans are recognized in other comprehensive income  and presented within equity in the cash /f_low hedging reserve.
Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identi/f_ied and carry  forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment to  goodwill.
Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets  and liabilities is primarily recorded in the statement of income.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company  considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred  tax asset will be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred  tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable  pro/f_its during the periods in which those temporary diﬀerences  and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible.
The Company  considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities,  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in  making this assessment.
Based on this, the Company believes  that it is probable that the Company will realize the bene/f_its of  these deductible diﬀerences.
The amount of deferred tax asset  considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near  term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry- forward period are reduced.
Deferred tax asset amounting to ` 1,858 and ` 1,782 as at  March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively in respect of unused  tax losses have not been recognized by the Company.
The tax  loss carry-forwards of ` 6,509 and ` 6,679 as at March/uni00A031, 2015  and March/uni00A031, 2016, respectively, relates to certain subsidiaries  on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the  Company, because there is a lack of reasonable certainty  that these subsidiaries may generate future taxable pro/f_its.
Approximately, ` 4,971 and ` 6,117 as at March/uni00A031, 2015 and  March/uni00A031, 2016, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is  not currently subject to expiration dates.
The remaining tax loss  carry-forwards of approximately ` 1,538 and ` 562 as at March/uni00A031,  2015 and March/uni00A031, 2016, respectively, expires in various years  through /f_iscal 2036.
The Company has recognized deferred tax assets of ` 3,589 and   ` 5,976 in respect of carry forward losses of its various subsidiaries  as at March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016.
Management’s projections of  future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the  assumption that it is probable that suﬃcient taxable income will  be available to utilize these deferred tax assets.
Pursuant to the changes in the Indian income tax laws, Minimum  Alternate Tax (MAT) has been extended to income in respect  of which deduction is claimed under Section/uni00A0 10A, 10B and  10AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961; consequently, the Company  has calculated its tax liability for current domestic taxes after  considering MAT.
The excess tax paid under MAT provisions  over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward and  set-oﬀ against future tax liabilities computed under normal  tax provisions.
The Company was required to pay MAT and  accordingly, a deferred tax asset of ` 1,844 and ` 1,457 has been  recognized in the statement of /f_inancial position as of March/uni00A031,  2015 and 2016 respectively, which can be carried forward for a  period of ten years from the year of recognition.
A substantial portion of the pro/f_its of the Company’s India  operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being pro/f_its  attributable to export operations and pro/f_its from undertakings  situated in Software Technology, Hardware Technology Parks  and Export Oriented units.
Under the tax holiday, the taxpayer  can utilize an exemption from income taxes for a period of any  ten consecutive years.
The tax holidays on all facilities under  Software Technology, Hardware Technology Parks and Export  oriented units has expired on March/uni00A0 31, 2011.
Additionally,  under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme, units in  designated special economic zones providing service on or after  April/uni00A01, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of  pro/f_its or gains derived from the export of services for the /f_irst  /f_ive years from commencement of provision of services and 50  percent of such pro/f_its and gains for a further /f_ive years.
Certain  tax bene/f_its are also available for a further /f_ive years subject to  the unit meeting de/f_ined conditions.
Pro/f_its from certain other  undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment.
The  tax holiday period being currently available to the Company  expires in various years through /f_iscal 2029.
The expiration  period of tax holiday for each unit within a SEZ is determined  based on the number of years that have lapsed following year  of commencement of production by that unit.
The impact of  tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense  of ` 11,043, ` 11,412 and ` 10,212 for the years ended March/uni00A031,  2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, compared to the eﬀective tax  amounts that we estimate we would have been required to pay  if these incentives had not been available.
The per share eﬀect  of these tax incentives for the years ended March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015  and 2016 was ` 4.50, ` 4.65 and ` 4.16 respectively.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary diﬀerences except in respect of taxable temporary  diﬀerences associated with investments in subsidiaries where  the timing of the reversal of the temporary diﬀerence can be  controlled and it is probable that the temporary diﬀerence will  not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, deferred  income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries  amounting to ` 26,313 and ` 33,920 as of March/uni00A031, 2015 and  2016, respectively has not been recognized.
Further, it is not  practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred  tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.
The Company is subject to U.S. tax on income attributable to its  permanent establishment in the United States due to operation  of the U.S. branch.
In addition, the Company is subject to a 15%  branch pro/f_it tax in the United States on the “dividend equivalent  amount” as that term is de/f_ined under U.S. tax law.
The Company  has not triggered the branch pro/f_it tax until year ended March/uni00A031,  2016.
The Company intends to maintain the current level of net  assets in the United States commensurate with its operation and  consistent with its business plan.
The Company does not intend  to repatriate out of the United States any portion of its current  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 251 pro/f_its.
Accordingly, the Company did not record current and  deferred tax provision for branch pro/f_it tax.

Dividends and Buy Back of equity shares  The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees.
According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should  be declared out of accumulated distributable profits.
A  company may, before the declaration of any dividend, transfer a  percentage of its pro/f_its for that /f_inancial year as it may consider  appropriate to the reserves.
The cash dividends paid per equity share were ` 8, ` 10 and  ` 12 during the years ended March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015 and 2016,  respectively, including an interim dividend of ` 3, ` 5 and ` 5  for the years ended March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on April/uni00A0 20, 2016  proposed a /f_inal dividend of ` 1 (U.S.$ 0.02)/uni00A0per equity share and  ADS.
The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at  the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the shareholders, and  if approved, would result in a cash out/f_low of approximately  ` 2,974, including corporate dividend tax thereon.
The  proposed dividend has not been included as a liability in these  consolidated /f_inancial statements.
On April/uni00A020, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a buyback  proposal for purchase by the Company of up to 40/uni00A0million shares  of ` 2 each (representing 1.62% of total equity capital) from the  shareholders of the Company on a proportionate basis by way of  a tender oﬀer at a price of ` 625/uni00A0per equity share for an aggregate  amount not exceeding ` 25,000/uni00A0million in accordance with the  provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI (Buy Back  of Securities) Regulations, 1998.

Additional capital disclosures  The key objective of the Company’s capital management is  to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the  focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor and customer  con/f_idence and to ensure future development of its business.
The  Company focused on keeping strong total equity base to ensure  independence, security, as well as a high /f_inancial /f_lexibility for  potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the  risk pro/f_ile of the Company.
The Company’s goal is to continue to be able to return excess  liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual  dividends in future periods.
The Company has distributed an  interim dividend of ` 5/uni00A0per equity share during the year ended  March/uni00A0 31, 2016.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on  April/uni00A020, 2016 proposed a /f_inal dividend of ` 1 (U.S. $ 0.02)/uni00A0per  equity share and ADS.
The proposal is subject to the approval of  shareholders.
Further, the board of directors has approved a buy  back proposal for purchase of 40/uni00A0million equity shares through  a tender oﬀer at a price of ` 625/uni00A0per equity share.
The amount  of future dividends will be balanced with eﬀorts to continue to  maintain an adequate liquidity status.
The capital structure as of March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016 was as  follows:  /uni00A0 As at March/uni00A031, /uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A0 2015 /uni00A02016 %/uni00A0Change Total equity attributable  to the equity  shareholders of the  Company ` 407,982 ` 466,078 14.24% As percentage of total  capital 84% 79% /uni00A0 Current loans and  borrowings 66,206 107,860 /uni00A0 Non-current loans and  borrowings 12,707 17,361 /uni00A0 Total loans and  borrowings 78,913 125,221 58.68% As percentage of total  capital 16% 21% /uni00A0 Total capital (loans and  borrowings and equity) ` 486,895 ` 591,299 21.44% Loans and borrowings represented 16% and 21/uni00A0% of total capital  as of March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Commitments and contingencies  Operating leases: The Company has taken oﬃce, vehicles and IT  equipment under cancellable and non-cancellable operating  lease agreements that are renewable on a periodic basis at the  option of both the lessor and the lessee.
The operating lease  agreements extend up to a maximum of /f_ifteen years from  their respective dates of inception and some of these lease  agreements have price escalation clause.
Rental payments under  such leases were ` 4,583, ` 4,727 and ` 5,184 for the year ended  March/uni00A031, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Details of contractual payments under non-cancelable leases  are given below:  /uni00A0 /uni00A0 As at March/uni00A031,/uni00A0 2015/uni00A02016 Not later than one year `         3,351 `        4,246 Later than one year but not later  than /f_ive years 6,385 9,900 Later than /f_ive years 2,206 2,713 /uni00A0 `      11,942 `     16,859 Capital commitments: As at March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016, the  Company had committed to spend approximately ` 1,262 and  `/uni00A010,734 respectively, under agreements to purchase property  and equipment.
These amounts are net of capital advances paid  in respect of these purchases.
Guarantees: As at March/uni00A0 31, 2015 and 2016, performance  and /f_inancial guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the  Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain  other agencies amount to approximately ` 21,234 and ` 25,218  respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.
Contingencies and lawsuits:  The Company is subject to legal  proceedings and claims (including tax assessment orders/  penalty notices) which have arisen in the ordinary course of its  business.
Some of the claims involve complex issues and it is not  possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected /f_inancial  eﬀect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such  proceedings.
However, the resolution of these legal proceedings  is not likely to have a material and adverse eﬀect on the results  of operations or the /f_inancial position of the Company.
The  signi/f_icant of such matters are discussed below.
In March 2004, the Company received a tax demand for year  ended March/uni00A0 31, 2001 arising primarily on account of denial  of deduction under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961  (Act) in respect of pro/f_it earned by the Company’s undertaking  in Software Technology Park at Bangalore.
The same issue was  repeated in the successive assessments for the years ended  March/uni00A031, 2002 to March/uni00A031, 2011 and the aggregate demand  is `/uni00A0 47,583 (including interest of `/uni00A0 13,832).
The appeals /f_iled  against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have  been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate  authority for the years up to March/uni00A031, 2007.
Further appeals  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 262 Annual Report 2015-16 have been /f_iled by the Income tax authorities before the Hon’ble  High Court.
The Hon’ble High Court has heard and disposed-oﬀ  majority of the issues in favor of the Company up to years ended  March/uni00A031, 2004.
On similar issues for years up to March/uni00A031, 2000, the Hon’ble  High Court of Karnataka has upheld the claim of the Company  under section 10A of the Act.
For the years ended March/uni00A031, 2008  and March/uni00A031, 2009, the appeals are pending before Income Tax  Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal).
For years ended March/uni00A031, 2010  and March/uni00A031, 2011, the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) allowed  the claim of the Company under section 10A of the Act.
The  Income tax authorities have /f_iled an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March/uni00A0 31, 2012, the Company received the  draft assessment order in March 2016 with a proposed demand  of `/uni00A0 4,241 (including interest of ` 1,376), arising primarily on  account of section 10AA issues with respect to exclusion from  Export Turnover.
Company has /f_iled an objection before DRP  within the prescribed timelines.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the order  of the appellate authority / Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka  upholding the claims of the Company for earlier years, the  Company believes that the /f_inal outcome of the above disputes  should be in favor of the Company and there should not be any  material adverse impact on the /f_inancial statements.
The Contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for  excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters amounts to  `/uni00A02,560 and ` 2,654 as of March/uni00A031, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Segment Information  The Company is organized by the following operating segments:  IT Services and IT Products.
IT Services:  The IT Services segment primarily consists of IT  Service oﬀerings to customers organized by industry verticals  as follows: Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI),  Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS), Retail, Consumer, Transport  and Government (RCTG), Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities  (ENU), Manufacturing (MFG), Global Media and Telecom (GMT).
It also includes Others which comprises dividend income and  gains or losses (net) relating to strategic investments, which are  presented within “Finance and other income” in the statement  of Income.
Key service oﬀering to customers includes software  application development and maintenance, research and  development services for hardware and software design,  business application services, analytics, digital, consulting,  infrastructure outsourcing services and business process  services.
IT Products: The Company is a value added reseller of desktops,  servers, notebooks, storage products, networking solutions  and packaged software for leading international brands.
In  certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT Services segment,  the Company delivers hardware, software products and other  related deliverables.

Revenue relating to the above items is reported as revenue from  the sale of IT Products.
The Chairman/uni00A0& Managing Director of the Company has been  identi/f_ied as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as  de/f_ined by IFRS 8, “Operating Segments.

Assets and liabilities used in the Company’s business are not  identi/f_ied to any of the operating segments, as these are used  interchangeably between segments.
Management believes that  it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures  relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful  segregation of the available data is onerous.
