:  05804-900  Brazil 84 Annual Report 2013-14 BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Introductory Context  This section provides an overview of Wipro’s sustainability  program for the year 2013-14.
This is the third year that we  are including a Business Responsibility Report (BRR) as part of  our Annual Financial Report.
The report is a summary of our  sustainability program and must be read in conjunction with  our more detailed sustainability report which is published  separately every year.
Our Sustainability reporting is based on the GRI 3.1 framework  and have been prepared to meet application level “A” based on  a rigorous external assessment for the last six years.
In preparing  this overview, while drawing from our GRI reporting experience,  we have largely aligned it with the ‘National Voluntary  Guidelines (NVGs) on the Social, Environmental and Economic  responsibilities of Business” released by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs in 2011.
As per SEBI requirements, as on March 31 2012,  the top 100 listed companies based on market capitalization at  BSE and NSE need to include Business Responsibility reports  as part of their Annual Reports.
Sections A to D of the SEBI  suggested reporting framework will be available online at     http://www.wipro.com/investors/annual-reports.aspx.
This  section broadly covers section E of the framework.
i.
For details of the NVGs, please refer  http://www.iica.in/ images/MCA_NVG_BOOKLET.pdf          ii.
Our Sustainability Reports can be viewed and downloaded at  www.wipro.com/about-wipro/sustainability/sustainability- disclosures.aspx                  Materiality and Scope:  The scope of this report covers all of Wipro Ltd’s business - unless  mentioned otherwise -  and is for the financial year 2013-14 .
The content for this section is driven by the twin pillars of  Stakeholder Inclusiveness  and Materiality Determination  i.e.
‘Who are our stakeholders’ and ‘What issues are material to them’ The stakeholders, identification of nineteen material aspects  and their relative position in terms of relevance to Wipro and  stakeholders is available at http://wiprosustainabilityreport.
com/materiality-determination.
The principal sustainability topics covered in this report  are structured as shown in the table below ; for clarity of  understanding, the corresponding NVG principle against each  topic is mentioned.
Sustainability Dimension Sustainability Dimension NVG Principle(s) Stakeholder Engagement   4 Corporate Governance 1 Human Capital – People  Engagement at  Wipro 3, 5 and 4 Ecological Sustainability 6 Value Chain Sustainability 2 and 9 Education and Community 8 Advocacy and Outreach 7 Stakeholder Engagement Management Approach: Our eight sustainability stakeholders  are: Customers, Investors, Employees, Suppliers, Government,  Education Partners, Community Partners and Future  Generations.
What follows is a brief contextual explanation  for each stakeholder.
At Wipro, we have always viewed our Customers, Employees  and Investors as strategic partners and stakeholders.
Over  the last decade, our programs in education and community  care have brought us in close engagement with two new  stakeholders – Partners in the Education Ecosystem and  Proximate Communities.
While the IT services industry model  does not necessitate a deep supply chain, the rapid expansion  of this sector in the last two decades has resulted in a variety  of ancillary services e.g.
bus transport, housekeeping, canteen,  security.
Services Suppliers and Contractors have thus become  critical stakeholders for our operations.
Wipro Limited 85  Wipro engages closely with Government on policy advocacy,  both through industry networks as well as directly.
The  principal areas of engagement relate to energy, water, e-waste,  education policy and the recent CSR rules under the Companies  Act 2013.
We think that the future must inform our thinking and actions  on sustainability more than anything else, as otherwise our  vision will stop short of being truly sustainable; therefore, our  eight stakeholder is Future Generations.
While this stakeholder  group may not have a tangible and real face to it, we try to  use them as an anchoring guide for our thinking and actions.
The summary representation of our eight stakeholders, the  modes and frequency of our engagement with them and  the major issues of engagement that have emerged over a  period of time are available at http://wiprosustainabilityreport.
com/summary-stakeholder-engagement  of the 2012-13  Sustainability Report for IT business.
Corporate Governance An organization’s economic and social license to operate depends  on the soundness of its governance and management practices.
The visual below showing the organizational architecture of  Wipro illustrates this point – most of the boxes reflect a long- term orientation that a company needs to assiduously build and  ingrain into its DNA.
Sustainability Governance The centrality of Sustainability to Wipro’s vision and outlook  is reflected in the commitment and engagement with  sustainability issues by Wipro’s leadership team, starting with  our Chairman.
The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) who carries  overarching responsibility for our sustainability charter reports  to the Chairman and is part of the Corporate Executive Council,  the senior most executive body in the organization.
The strength  of our sustainability governance is also derived from the fact  that multiple functions see themselves as key stakeholders  in its success; among these, the Global Operations team, the  People Function, the Investor Relations team and the Legal team  play a major role in several of the programs.
The sustainability  program is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Chairman and  the Corporate Executive Council.
For other details on Corporate Governance – including the  governance structure, mechanisms, composition of board, board  sub-committees, etc - please refer to the Corporate Governance  section of this Annual Report  Code of Business Conduct Wipro has a corporation wide Code of Business Conduct  (COBC)  that provides the broad direction as well as specific guidelines  for all business transactions.
The emphasis is on human rights,  prevention of fraudulent and corrupt practices, freedom of  association, elimination of child and forced labor, advertisement  and media policy, avoidance of conflict of interest, prevention of  sexual harassment and unyielding integrity at all times.
The COBC  is applicable to all business practices and employees, contractor  employees and consultants.
An updated COBC was launched  in 13-14, with emphasis on readability and key tenets being  made accessible through a Q&A format.
The updated code can  be accessed at http://www.wipro.com/Documents/investors/ pdf-files/code-of-business-conduct.pdf.
The COBC is socialized  at multiple points of an employee’s lifecycle - it is first covered  as part of the induction program of new hires and subsequently,  every employee has to take an online test annually to assert his  familiarity with the tenets of the COBCE.
We have a zero tolerance  policy for non compliance with the non-negotiable aspects of  COBC e.g.
child labor, anti-corruption etc.
The Ombuds-process Having a robust whistleblower policy that employees and other  stakeholders can use without fear or apprehension is a sine non  qua for a transparent and ethical company.
Wipro’s Ombuds- process is designed to be this and more.
It allows and encourages  any affected stakeholder to report breaches of the COBC and any  other matter of integrity to the concerned Ombuds-person.
In  conjunction with the Prevention of Sexual Harassment policy,  the Ombudsprocess provides a strong framework of assurance  and protection to women employees.
In Wipro, our General Counsel is also the Chief Ombuds-person  who works with designated Ombuds-persons in each  Governance and Management Architecture at Wipro PEOPLE  POLICIES PROCESSES Continuous  learning People Talent  Supply   Chain Global   Delivery   Model     Wividus  Backoffice Continuous  Internal   Audit Environment  Health,   Safety Information  Security Procurement Empowered  workplace Leadership  development Diversity &   Inclusivity      Strategic   planning Operational   Planning Regular reviews by   Board and CEC Governance •		Enterprise   Risk Management        •	COBC •	Ombuds-process •	Board	governance •	Internal	Audits Practices •	Innovation •	Quality •	Customer	Advocacy •	Global	Transformation •	Knowledge	   Management •	Business	Process	   Management Sustainability •	Resource	And   Cost Efficiency •		Ecological	footprint   reduction •	Education	and   Community •	Transparent	disclo- sures 86 Annual Report 2013-14 Business Unit.
The process ensures confidential and anonymous  submissions regarding (i) questionable accounting or auditing  matters, the conduct of which results in a violation of law by  Wipro (ii) substantial mismanagement of company resources  (iii) Any instance of sexual harassment or any other form of  discrimination (iv) Any violation of human rights as articulated  in the COBC and as per the principles of the U.N.Global Compact.
In 2011-12, the Ombuds portal was upgraded with a 24/7 multi- lingual hotline facility for ease of access in logging concerns as  well as access via web at www.wipro.com.
In 2013-14, a total  of 787complaints were received via the Ombudsprocess and  the action taken cases as of March 2014 was 95%.
Based on self  disclosure data, 68% of these were from employees and the  balance were mainly anonymous and from other stakeholders  like vendors and customers.
Human Capital –  People Engagement at Wipro Management Approach: In the past year, our people function  effort has been shaped by a context of change, organizational  design adjustments and a greater need for agile talent  management.
Our talent management effort has focused  on building deeper skill in specific capability areas as well as  more robust, integrated processes for greater effectiveness.
We  have concentrated efforts on specific, high-impact areas that  are more critical to strategy and results, such as managerial  effectiveness.
Our efforts have helped us enrich the talent life-cycle.
One key  reason for this is our values-based culture; the Spirit of Wipro  values  weave the thread that ties all Wiproites together and  also shapes leadership behavior.
We seek employee feedback  on the Spirit of Wipro values in our Employee Perception Survey  as well as in our Wipro Leaders’ Qualities 360-degree leadership  competency feedback process.
Over a period of time, we have realized the need to articulate  specific behaviors aligned with our values that will unite us  as Wiproites, and help us stand differentiated in the market  place.
During 2013-14, we introduced a set of Tenets that  are easy to incorporate in day to day decision making and  operations.
Tenets bring out the behavioral essence of how a  Wiproite committed to win in the market place in the right way,  can approach customers, peers, team members.
Tenets stem  from our aspiration to focus on a global mind set and apply  innovation at work through speed, simplicity and excellence.
The Tenets were introduced by the CEO and his leadership  team via the companywide blogs that are run and read by  all Wiproites.
The tenets have also been incorporated in our  Wipro Leaders’ Qualities feedback process that covers nearly 20,000 leaders in across middle to top management levels.
Advocacy around the tenets takes place by the CEO during  the quarterly Wipro Meets engagement platform, as well as  through well-structured workshops that have been rolled out.
The intent is for all employees to participate in these workshops  over the next year or two.
Across countries and business units, it is our endeavor to align  our policies and actions around talent management, wellbeing  and Diversity and Inclusion with globally accepted standards  and country specific law.
Our people practices are shaped by  the Spirit of Wipro values, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,  as well as principles of the U.N.
Global Compact, U.N. Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour  Organization.
In addition, our India policies are aligned with  the National Voluntary Guidelines.
All employees are entrusted  and empowered to highlight concerns and grievances via  the Ombuds process and Prevention of Sexual Harassment  Committee.
Custodians and representatives of these processes  also create awareness and insight through mailers, posters and  other modes of communication.
Wiproites around the world Wipro’s employee strength, as on March 31, 2014 was 133,425  which comprises 31% women employees.
Our global workforce  across 59 countries comprises employees from 101 nationalities.
At overseas locations (outside India), 40% of the workforce is  comprised of local nationals.
Our workforce strength including permanent and non-core  workforce was over 159,000.
Permanent employee attrition for  2013-14 closed at 15.4%  Permanent Employee Strength - Wipro Ltd.

During 2013-14, our engagement programs  were more strongly positioned in alignment with our overall  people strategic drivers.
Apart from company and business  level engagement platforms such as ‘Wipro Meets’ and All  Hands Meets, HR practitioners and business leaders also drove  customized team and individual engagement initiatives targeted  at specific stakeholder groups, to create higher impact.
Wipro Limited 87 Engagement targets are important performance criteria for our  HR practitioners and achievement on these is monitored and  reviewed regularly.
Awareness and education on relevant and critical aspects of  human rights is a key component of our engagement effort.
This includes training and certification on our Code of Business  Conduct (COBC), Diversity and Inclusion, and Prevention of  Sexual Harassment.
These training courses are global in design  and reach, and available to all employees via an online e-learning  platform.
They cover all critical aspects of ethical conduct,  sensitivity and workplace behavior.
Certification on COBC and  Diversity and Inclusion is mandatory for all employees, and  completion levels are at 96% and close to 54,000 employees,  respectively.
Employee Advocacy Group (EAG)  The Employee Advocacy Group (EAG) is a 120+ member  representative group managed by Wiproites to voice employee  suggestions.
EAG Members are selected amongst employees with  the objective to hear out employee ideas and recommendations  to improve company policies and processes.
The EAG was  formed in Sep 2011 with the twin objectives of - channelizing  feedback on existing policies and practices, and also reviewing  new policies before launch, wherever feasible.
Since inception,  the EAG has received about 5095 suggestions.
During 2013- 14, 1963 suggestions were received from employees.
Themes  relating to HR and people processes, recruitment and training  account for approximately 50% of the total suggestions  received.
Suggestions are screened by the EAG team and  then by functional SPOCs.
The EAG then discusses shortlisted  suggestions with Function Heads, and implements them in  collaboration with functions.
The team has also led specific  improvement projects such as a revamp of the performance  management system and leave policy.

This  spirit of volunteerism is also evident in employee participation  in various Wipro Cares initiatives.
Employee Perception Survey (EPS) Employee Perception Survey is a key source through which we  judge the engagement and satisfaction levels of our employees.
Conducted once in every 2 years, its findings have always been  tracked with a keen eye and the identified room for improvement  is taken up for action in earnest.
Overall participation for IT business was at 65%, an increase  of 5% over EPS 2011.
While the overall engagement score  registered a dip over the 2012 EPS Pulse (mini-survey), almost  all individual levers of satisfaction showed an improvement.
Diversity, Team, Wipro Values and Customer Focus continue  to be the top strength areas, while Work Life Balance, Training  & Development, Role/Job and Senior Executive have emerged  as top areas of improvement.
Parameters that were identified  as improvement areas in EPS Pulse 2012, such as manager  capability and internal business process, showed the most  improvement.
As next steps the action planning at organization  and business unit level is currently underway with the leadership  and functional teams.
Wipro BPO Engagement Index Wipro BPO launched the Engagement Index (EI) in 2010, to  enhance engagement effectiveness for first level and mid-level  people managers from business across operations.
Managers  own engagement targets for engagement and retention of  talent, reward and recognition and fun-at-work; performance  data is tracked and translated into an EI score for each  manager.
Over the years, EI has been internalized as an integral  responsibility of people managers and is linked to their variable  pay as well.
Engagement Index achievement levels for 2013-14  closed at over 90%, consistent with 2012-13 levels.

92 Annual Report 2013-14 Ecological Sustainability  Management Approach: Ecological sustainability is a cornerstone of our charter and a  major driver of our key programs.
Our approach is built on the  pillars of Energy efficiency, GHG mitigation, Water efficiency  and Responsible Water management, Waste management,  Biodiversity and Product Stewardship.
The increasing centrality of issues like climate change and  water stress in the last few years has led organizations to  look beyond their boundaries.
While internal business drivers  like  resource efficiency, waste management and  pollution  mitigation have been the primary levers of any corporate   environmental program for many now, organizations have  come to realize that in order to make a real impact at a larger,  systemic level, one can no longer ignore the externalized  costs of ecological damage.
The responsible water program  and community programs on waste are two examples of  such programs.
What follows is a brief articulation of our programs on Energy  and GHG mitigation, Water, Waste and Biodiversity Scope of Reporting: India: All  68 locations, the majority of operations is from 29  owned locations representing 88% of our workforce.
Overseas:  83 locations, which includes 8 customer data centers.
Nearly all of the office locations overseas are leased.
Management system: We have been following the guidelines of the ISO 14001  framework for more than a decade now as one of the  cornerstones of our Environmental Management System (EMS).
19 of our campus sites in India and 2 in Australia are certified to  the standards of ISO 14001:2004.
Energy: Goal(s) To Reduce the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG intensity of Wipro’s  operations by 45% over a 4 year period : from 2.42 MT per  employee in 2010-11 to 1.3 MT per employee by 2014-15,  translating into a net reduction of nearly 60,600 tons for Wipro  IT business.
This target applies to all of our campus facilities  and offices Absolute Emissions  The below dashboard provides a summary of our Global  carbon emissions intensity for Office spaces - from Scope 1  (emission from direct energy consumption, like fuel) and Scope  2 (emissions from purchased electricity).
The figures are the  net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions for  renewable energy procured.
Tons CO2 eq.
The total energy consumption, electricity and back-up diesel  generated, for office spaces across all global operations in IT  is 325 Mn Units.
Data centers, India and overseas (USA and  Germany) contribute to another  77 Mn units.
Note: Actual GHG intensity for 2013-14 would be lower, at 1.69, if one considers  the same grid emission factors used for 2012-13 (CEA Ver 8 report, Report released  in Jan 2013).
Office Space Energy Metrics Energy efficiency measures contributed  to a 5.2 % decrease  in office space energy intensity from 2952 to 2799 units  per employee per annum.
This is primarily from  (a) energy  optimization measures ,retrofit of older equipment with more  energy efficient equipment  and consolidation of operations  Wipro Limited 93 accompanied by a transition from leased to owned facilities   with the  resulting increase in  overall utilization of office space   and better quality of maintenance operations (b) Increase in  share of renewable energy from 19%  to 22% of the total office  energy consumption.
However the emissions intensity has decreased by only 2%,  compared to intensity reduction rates of 7 to 9% in earlier years.
This is largely due to significant change in the emission factors  of the Indian Grid ; for example the emission factor for the south  grid, where the majority of our operations are located in India,  has increased by nearly 12% compared to last year – from 0.76  Kg/KwH to 0.85 Kg/KwH.
According to the latest report from  the Central Electricity Authority of India (Ver 9, Jan 2014), this   is primarily for two reasons: the higher share of coal based  generation relative to natural gas and lower share of hydro  power related to lower water availability in the southern grid  region.
The emission intensity reduction would have been 8%  if we had considered the earlier emission factors report (CEA  Ver 8, Jan 2013).
GHG Mitigation Strategy Our five year GHG mitigation strategy consists of three key  elements – Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy (RE) Purchase  and Captive RE ; of this, RE procurement will contribute the  maximum, 80% share to GHG emission mitigation strategy.
GHG Mitigation Approach  Energy Efficiency:   Over the preceding five year period, we have implemented  a variety of energy efficiency measures .
We were one of the  early adopters of Green Building Design with 19 of our current  buildings certified to the international LEED standard ( Silver,  Gold, Platinum) .
Since 2007, we have been working on a server rationalization and  virtualization program, through which we have decommissioned  old physical servers and replaced the processing capacity with  virtualization technology on fewer numbers of servers.
As of  March 2014, we have 1990 virtual servers running on 117 physical  servers – contributing to an energy savings of approximately 8.7  Million units annually, an increase of 10% over the previous year.
RE procurement: For the reporting period of 2013-14, we procured 71 Mn units of  Renewable energy through PPAs (Power Purchase agreements)  with private producers, which contributed to approximately 22%  of our total office space energy consumption  in the IT business.
The study that we commissioned along with an external  consultant to map our consumption and expected growth  pattern for each of our location in India, and identify suitable  medium to long term energy sourcing has been completed.
The  recommendations for  longer term strategic power procurement  are being implemented across various states.
Captive RE:   The pilot rooftop Solar PV installations at 3 of our campuses  followed by extensive  use of solar water heaters in our guest  blocks and cafeterias have resulted in equivalent savings of 1.6  Mn units of grid electricity.
A summary of our Scope 3 emissions (other indirect sources ) is  provided below.
Out of the 15 categories of scope 3 reporting  as per the new GHG corporate value chain standard, we are  presently reporting on 9 of the 12 applicable categories.. 94 Annual Report 2013-14 The table below shows the extent of coverage across our operations for the major Scope 3 categories Scope 3  Emissions Category Applicability Current Reporting, Coverage within IT business Upstream scope 3 emissions Purchased goods and services Yes Yes, 85% (India) Included in the “Value Chain Sustainability”  part of this Section Capital goods Yes Included as part of “Purchased Goods and Services” Fuel- and energy-related activities (not  included in scope 1 or scope 2) Yes Not yet reported Upstream transportation and distribution Yes Yes, Approximately 80%  coverage by Weight-Distance  - IT  equipment imports for Services Waste generated in operations Yes Yes, 85% (India) Business travel Yes Yes, 100%  Employee commuting Yes Yes, 85% (India) Upstream leased assets (Leased office space) Y es Yes, 100% this is reported under Scope 1 & 2 Downstream scope 3 emissions Downstream transportation and distribution Yes Not reported this year and will not be applicable from 2014-15  year.
For transportation & distribution of computer products Processing of sold products No Use of sold products Yes Yes, 100%  End-of-life treatment of sold products Yes Yes, to the extent of  product end of life  channelized to Wipro.
Downstream leased assets No Franchises No Investments Yes Not Yet Reported The overall emissions across all scopes is 447466 tons.
Within this,  the three big contributors to our GHG emissions are: Electricity  – Purchased and Generated ( 55%), Business Travel ( 23%) and  Employee Commute ( 19%).
Business Travel  The IT services outsourcing model require frequent travel to  customer locations, mainly overseas, across the delivery life  cycle and contributes to around 1/4thof our overall emissions  footprint.
This includes air, bus, train, local conveyance and hotel  stays.
Policies on usage of different modes of travel based on  distance and time taken, need based travel approval and shift  towards processes which enable travel planning by employees  themselves are some of the cost and process optimization  measures implemented over past few years.
One of the key  initiatives piloted in 13-14 was the cab pooling facility at all our  campus guest houses for travel to airport and train stations.
The hospitality team tries to allocate pooled cabs based on  nearest departure times and informs guests of this service.
In  the reporting year, this initiative saved 1033 individual trips and  fuel savings of 3171 liters.
Remote collaboration and mobile productivity enablers Over the years, we have launched various remote collaboration  and workstation productivity solutions, like internet enabled  voice and video conferenci ng technologies, accessibility of  intranet based work applications over internet and mobile  devices.
Employee Commute: Employees have various choices for commuting informed  primarily by distance, flexibility, work timings, costs, city  infrastructure and connectivity in the case of group or public  transport.
In addition to company arranged transport ( 50%),  employees utilize public transport(30-35%), with owned cars  and two wheelers accounting for the balance.
Over the past few  years, we have taken steps to facilitate a shift towards improved  access to public transport for employees (buses, commuter  trains) apart from encouraging cycling to work through an active  cycling community in the organization.
For the preceding three  year period (2010-2013) we conducted an annual transport  survey which provided insights into modes of transport, distance  traversed and qualitative feedback on commute facilitation  across our locations.
Around 6000 people have participated in  these surveys annually.
We have used the three year average  of the distance traversed by employees to calculate emissions  from personal modes of employee commute this year – there  is no significant deviation expected in the reporting year based  on this evidence and observed trends.
IT led soft infrastructure  enablers  like anytime direct connectivity access to office intranet  applications,  secure personal device connectivity through the  BYOD initiative (Bring Your Own Devices) are steps in enabling  more flexible work place options.
Wipro Limited 95 Emissions during product use and end of life treatment of  sold products: We assume a 15 to 18% energy efficiency of our Energy Star 5  (ES-5) compliant computing products (desktop and laptop) over  conventional models.
Considering a life time of 5 years for our  products and based on the sales of ES-5 in the reporting year,  we estimate a savings of 2413 tons of CO2 equivalent due to  product use.
The total in use emissions from our hardware products over a  five year period, for the ES 5 and conventional models sold in  the reporting year (2013-14), is estimated at 116856 tons of CO2  equivalent.
Through our e-waste take back program we have  processed  140 tons of electronic end of life in 2013-14, which  also includes some non-Wipro sold products.
The emission from  the e-waste disposal is estimated at 1.40 tons of CO2 equivalent  (as per US EPA’s WARM tool emission factor).
However, all e-waste  is collected and recycled by authorised recyclers.
Water: Intensity and Recycling Ratio At Wipro, we view water from the three inter-related lens of  Conservation, Responsibility and Security; our articulated goals  are therefore predicated on these three dimensions.
Sourcing of Water:  Water is withdrawn from four sources -  ground water, municipal water supplies, private purchase and  harvested rain water – with the first two sources accounting for  nearly 60% of the sourced water.
The majority of the balance 38%  is from private sources near our operational facilities.
The water  supplied by the municipal bodies and the industrial association  are in turn sourced  primarily from river or lake systems.
Water  that is purchased from private sources can be traced to have  been extracted from ground water.
Freshwater recycling and efficiency: The per employee water  consumption for the reporting year is 1.46 m3 per month as  compared to 1.57 in 2012-13, an improvement of around 7%.
We recycle 888828 m3 of water in 24 of our major locations,  (839388.605 in 2012-13) using Sewage Treatment Plants  (STPs), which represents 32%  (30% in 2012-13) of the total  water consumed.
The percentage of this recycled water as  a percentage of freshwater extracted is around 47%.
The  reduction in freshwater consumption has been primarily through  demand side optimization, reduction in pipeline leakages and  increasing water governance by building user awareness and  involvement of water plumbers.
We launched a program in 2013 with the aim to minimize  freshwater consumption by 20% over the following two years  through an integrated approach: 1)  Implement Standard metering infrastructure and  procedures across campuses 2)  Demand side optimization (improving efficiency through  flow restrictors across campuses and arresting leakages), 3)   Improving recycling levels through ultra filtration using it  for other non-contact purposes 4)  Integrating rain water harvesting into the consumption  side water cycle of the campus.
The Responsible Water program:  A significant proportion, estimated at 2/3rd of our total  water footprint, can be traced to ground water.
With the  current rates of withdrawal, over half of the ground water  blocks are expected to be in a critical condition by end of  this decade.
Considering the increasing role and importance  of groundwater management both in the urban and rural  context we started the Responsible water program in 2012.
The Phase 1 of the program has helped develop a useful  framework which informs and evaluates various internal  and “beyond the fence” aspects around water management.
These cover knowledge and governance around design,  institutional, ecological and social factors in water sourcing  and demand management.
Developed in consultation with  a group of water experts, social scientists and academia, the  framework provides an integrated perspective on multiple  dimensions of sourcing, demand profile,  rainfall endowment  and entitlement as inputs for informing our responses to our  water  footprint.
96 Annual Report 2013-14   The Phase 1 study has also corroborated our belief that the  multiplier effect in responsible water management can come  about by better understanding of various factors impacting  watershed and aquifer flows; including behavioral drivers and  management practices among all community stakeholders.
Also, community stakeholders are likely to have better  ownership and connect with the issues and its impact if they  are an integral part of the knowledge creation and decision  making processes.
The core objectives of Phase 2, started in Jan 2014, are to  enable better watershed management in the Sarjapur area of  Bangalore where we have a large operational facility.
Covering  an area of nearly 35 Sq KM, the program’s scope includes • Creating a watershed mapping/management framework  that includes ground water aquifers and other sources of  water • Building knowledge systems and platforms for sharing  information, eliciting participation from citizens and the  sharing of best practices on water management at the  community level.
These knowledge systems/platforms  will need to be designed to meet the requirements of the  community.
• Involving community stakeholders, especially schools and  residents, in understanding and managing water resources.
For this, the program will closely work with partners who  work with schools and local communities.
• Building advocacy around management of watersheds  with Urban Local Bodies and community stakeholders.
This is envisaged as a three year program and the starting  scope is the Wipro Sarjapur Campus and its immediate  environs.
The extent of the watershed is estimated to be  around 35 sq km.
Primary data collection and work on  methodology development and platform is in progress.
Biodiversity: As an organization with large campuses in urban settings,  we are acutely conscious of our responsibility towards urban  diversity and have set for ourselves the following goals.
• To convert five of our existing campuses to biodiversity  zones by 2015.
• All new campuses will incorporate biodiversity principles  into their design   In our approach towards campus biodiversity, our program  takes an integrated approach towards the contribution in  reducing energy and carbon intensity and improving water  retention and harvesting.
Our first campus biodiversity project was initiated in 2011 at  our Electronics city facility in Bangalore and  started with an  assessment of the existing plant, birds, butterflies, insects, small  mammals and other taxa in the campus.
The initial study made  recommendations to increase the diversity of locally adapted  species .
The project area is divided into four themed parts: The first stage of the project - the butterfly park – was completed  in March 2013.
The park is witness  to hundreds of migratory  butterflies who stop over in the park for nearly a month in their  400 Km pre monsoon annual migration from western to the  eastern ghats in India.
The second phase of the project, a ~3 acre  Wetland park, is conceptualized as a series of five interconnected  water bodies.
We also started biodiversity programs at two of our  campuses in Pune, with the baseline assessment of biodiversity  in the campus.
Redesigning and planting work has started based  on the recommendations provided.
In all these programs we work closely with expert partners  in biodiversity, conservation, ecological design and  communications.
Building employee connect through expert  talks, workshops and field visits to community research centers  in forests, is a critical aspect of the program.
Wipro Limited 97 Pollution and Waste: Goal(s):     • 100% of organic waste to be handled in-house at owned  locations by end of 14-15  • 100% of paper, cardboard, hazardous and e-waste, mixed  metals/scrap and plastics to be recycled/ handled as per  approved methods by end of 14-15.
• Reduce Mixed solid waste intensity to half by 2017 (3  year target) as compared to 13-14 • Reduce landfill intensity to half by 2017 (3 year target)  as compared to 13-14 The above goals have been set on the basis of an extensive  independent audit done during 2012-13.
While our earlier  goal centered around only the aggregate level of recycling,  the recalibrated goals seek to be more granular and are set  at a category level Pollution of air and water poses one of the most serious threats  to community health and welfare.
Our waste management  strategies are centered around either (i) recycling the waste for  further use or (ii) arranging for safe disposal.
To operationalize our  strategy, we follow robust processes of segregating  waste into  organic, inorganic, e-waste, hazardous, packaging, biomedical  and other categories, which is then either recycled inhouse or  through outsourced vendor arrangements.
90% of the total waste of 3544 tons generated from our IT  India operations is reused or recycled –through both,  in- house recycling units and through authorized vendor tie- ups.
The balance, which is largely soiled tissue and mixed  solid waste(MSW) is landfilled.. Our plan is to reduce MSW  generation at source and further drive segregation into  recyclable organic-inorganics to increase diversion from landfills.
Thecomprehensive external waste assessment we conducted  across our locations  for electronic waste and solid waste streams  pointed to areas of improvement in governance and traceability  of waste streams across the recycler ecosystem .
We would work  with our partners and vendors in driving better practices and  behaviours  keeping in mind both human and ecological impacts  of any changes.
Fig: Waste Disposal methods split for 2013-14 We continually assess operational risks to the environment  and apply the precautionary principle in our approach to  get insights and plan – for example, the responsible water  program  and waste life cycle audits.
In the reporting period,  there were no instances of environmental fines imposed or  negative consequences due to our operations.
The emissions  and waste generated by the organization are based on updated  and approved consents as on date from respective SPCB/CPCB  and we also have not received any show cause/legal notices  relating to the same.
In the reporting period, across our business units, there were  no instances of environmental fines imposed or negative  consequences due to our operations.
The emissions and waste  generated by the organization are based on updated and approved  consents as on date from respective SPCB/CPCB and we also have  not received any show cause/legal notices relating to the same.
Value Chain Sustainability  Management Approach:  In this section we focus on the two core aspects of our value  chain:  customer stewardship and ethical supply chain.
The scale and complexity of supply chain ecosystem in  organisations is determined by various factors.
Some of  these are informed by key questions on business strategy  and operations design – Is it core or central to business,  Do we have the expertise or capabilities, Does it provide  us operational flexibility, Is it economical and so on.
On the  other hand, a complex and deep supply presents a unique  set of regulatory and sustainability challenges - for example  across most business sectors the environmental impacts of  the supply chain to an organization is nearly five times that of  its own operations.
Compliance on the social dimensions of  human rights, labour practices and ethical principles is seen  as a sine qua non today and even minor breaches can increase  the risk of reputational and legal damage greatly.
The organizations procurement policies and its degree of  influence and control are influenced by and operate within a  macro socio-economic conditions.
Our benchmark for supply  chain engagement while being cognizant of these factors is  informed by widely accepted global social and environmental  standards.
The ethical and social maturity of any supply chain  in any given context is influenced by:  • Societal indicators - like economic imbalances, human  development indices, lack of opportunity, information divide • Economics - Pricing of products and services in               98 Annual Report 2013-14 the market, Presence/absence of informal economy,  externalized costs of products and services • Interpretation of social values - which is often impacted  by culture and societal norms It is important for us to persist in these efforts and expect  incremental improvements.
These can be effected through  awareness building, regular communication, assessments  and incorporating criteria (incentivizing) into procurement  practices.
In the core IT services organization, our supply ecosystem  comprise of a fairly large proportion of contract workforce who  have specialized skills in software development.
The People  engagement function bears primary responsibility for engaging  with this group; details are covered in the earlier section on  “Human Capital” Ethical Supply Chain Program:  Apart from the core human  resources sourcing for IT projects, the key supplier groups are  facility management, Telecom, IT infrastructure, civil and other  business support serviceproviders.
In 2012-13, the supplier  code of conduct (SCOC) was launched which communicates  key requirements in business practices, environmental and  social aspects.
A preliminary environmental and social risk profiling of our  supplier base was conducted in 2012 in association with two  UK based organizations, Trucost and Fronesys for Central  Procurement office (CPO) tracked spend.
The environmental  footprint for 2013-14 is extrapolated based on the spend trends  for the reporting year.
Environmental footprint of our IT services Value chain Local Procurement: Recognizing the socio-economic benefits  of local procurement, we encourage sourcing from the local  economy.
At an aggregate level, nearly 81% of our suppliers are  based in India; by value 73% of the procurement for the year  was from India based suppliers.
Local sourcing reduces costs,  provides local employment benefits and reduced environmental  footprint in sourcing.
Supplier Diversity: Wipro encourages Supplier Diversity by  identifying and engaging qualified suppliers in the following  categories: Supplier firms owned by person with disability,  Women owned Enterprises and Minority Owned Enterprise.
Wipro is an Equal Opportunity employer and strongly advocates  the same through it’s supply chain.
Diversity supplier spend  contributes to 11.4% of total central procurement tracked spend  for India operations.
Diversity classification is based on supplier  self disclosure and is not verified.
A dedicated vendor helpdesk handles supplier queries on  payment issues, policy clarifications and provides the initial  contact for grievance redressal.
Our organization wide multi- lingual Ombuds process is available 24x7 (phone and internet  enabled) for our Suppliers and Contractors.
While a good  proportion of ombuds process cases are anonymous, based on  self disclosure, we know that there were 16 complaints reported  by suppliers during the year.
There were two instances of serious  supplier breaches of our code of conduct, both of who have  been black listed.
There have been no instances related to anti-trust in the  reporting period across our business divisions.
Customer Stewardship:  Wipro is one of the pioneering IT Services  Vendor in providing dedicated System Integrator (SI) services  to the  oil and gas, utilities, mining and recently engineering  & construction industries globally.

Customer advocacy is integrated as part of the core quality and  delivery functions and drives customer satisfaction improvement  initiatives across the organisation.
Regular Customer satisfaction  measurement through multi-modal, regular surveys across key  stakeholders in the customer organization is a centralpart of  understanding the “voice of customer” .
This group acts as an  early warning system of potential customer issues and enables  the system to address these issues before they become serious.
The team is also responsible for driving effective closures of  customer escalations and action plans.
We see  a continuing   improvement in our Net Promoter Score of the IT business, up  15.8% for 2013-14 as compared to the previous year.
Wipro Limited 99 Education and Community Management Approach: Our social transformation initiatives are now more than a decade old.
Over the years, our approach has been to engage in critical  social issues with sensitivity, rigor and responsibility.
Education and Community Care are the two areas that we decided focus on when we started twelve years back.
The reasons for  this deliberate set of choices have the same compelling validity today as they had then • Education is probably the most important catalyst of social development which can bring about change that is truly  sustainable and durable over the long term; and • It is a fundamental responsibility and tenet of corporate citizenship  that every business should engage deeply with its  proximate communities and to try to address some of their biggest challenges Digital Inclusion is a more recent addition to our community program through its focus on low cost technology interventions in  health care and citizen services for rural areas.
The following visual is a summary view of our three social transformation programs addressing the two focus areas: School Education Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS) has been engaged in building capacities for school education reform in India for close  to 12 years.
As education reform in India is a large canvas, our strategy is to work towards excellence in few selected areas that are  important to good quality education, but are often neglected in schools.
100 Annual Report 2013-14 WATIS has worked with around 2000 schools and 10,500  educators across 17 states reaching around 800,000 students.
Key Highlights of 2013-14 • We commenced 4 new partnerships in 2013-14,  including  in newer regions in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
One new  WATIS Fellowship was started to study Social Inclusion in  Schools • Successfully organized the WATIS Partners’ Forum in Feb,  2014, on the theme of “Textbooks and Education” .
The 3-day  forum was attended by over 70 participants from civil society  orgs as well as various state governments such as Bihar, AP  and Karnataka.
• Launched the GoodBooks portal last year, to encourage  the development and use of good children’s literature in the  country.
The portal has gained substantial traction in a short  period of time among its target audience.
• WATIS content is now also being disseminated through  new social media channels such as YouTube • Textbooks was taken up as an area of advocacy this year;  and an exhibition on ‘Textbooks in Colonial India’ was held at  the WATIS Partners’ forum, as a beginning.
• Our projects received regular coverage in both English and  the vernacular media; such as SeasonWatch (in Malyalam) and  GoodBooks (in English).
Wipro Science Education Fellowship Program in the U.S.A.
This program was launched in March 2013.
It is focused on  contributing to improving Science and Math education in  schools primarily serving disadvantaged communities in US  cities.
The program is currently launched in Chicago, in the  New Jersey area and in Boston.
We are partnering University of  Massachusetts, Boston, Michigan State University and Montclair  State University, NJ for this program.
The program works in close collaboration with over 10 school  districts to choose over 200 teachers, who go through a 2-3 year  fellowship, with intense support to develop their capacities to be  better teachers and change leaders.
The district administrators  are a part of the program.
Elementary and secondary teachers are chosen through a  rigorous selection process with defined criterion.
Each fellow  will then work with and train other teacher colleagues in  their school districts to develop their abilities in the STEM  disciplines.
Teachers will be chosen from all disciplines of Science,  Technology, Engineering and Math across all grade levels  (primary, middle and high schools).
The chosen teachers will go  through 1 year of capacity development (+2 years of continuing  engagement in the field).
Participants will take three graduate  level College of Education courses, focused on STEM education  and leadership.
The courses will require approximately 145-160  hours of work closely mentored by the partnering institutes  College of Education team, consisting of structured learning  assignments, interaction with peers / instructors and project  planning / implementation in their classrooms.
Each group of  25 teachers will also undergo a 6-week blended (combination of  face-to-face and online) intensive summer experience.
The goal  of the capacity development is to improve teaching capacity and  promote STEM education in their respective schools.
There will  be specific mechanisms and activities for each of the teachers  to institute change in the school and involve other teachers at  their schools.
While the Fellowship will be for a year, there will be another  year of follow-up sessions with the selected teachers, i.e.
they  will be in the program for 2 years.
Each teacher completing the  program will earn nine credits and a Graduate Certificate in STEM  Teaching and Leadership recognizing their commitment and  expertise in STEM fields in urban education.
The nine credits  can also be applied to further studies in Master’s programs in  the area of education.
The program is expected to expand to other cities over the next  2 years, starting with New York City and Connecticut.

• Affiliation with IITM Chennai, IIT Mumbai, Anna University,  VTU, JNTU, KIIT University, VIT University etc Community Care - Wipro Cares   Our primary work with communities is in Primary health care,  Education for the underprivileged and Long term disaster  rehabilitation.
2013-14 also saw an increase in coverage of villages, to bring  health services closer to villages with no facilities, through  our five primary health care projects at Aurangabad, Tumkur,  Hindupur, Mysore and Amalner.
The projects have reached  out to a population of around 36000 people at 39 villages.
In  Aurangabad five more villages were added under our primary  health care project and the Amalner project added two more  villages.
In Education, Wipro Cares added a project that reaches out to 500  children in Sarjapur area in Bangalore to improve their health and  educational status in collaboration with Magic Bus, India.
Further,  we have continued supporting the education of more than  47000 children in five cities through five projects in Bangalore,  Kolkata, Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Pune.
2013-14 is the last year  of our engagement with RockFund, Bangalore; around 60+ girl  children continuously benefitted from this program for 6 years.
Our social forestry project, in its third phase now, saw the  planting of 25,000 young saplings by about 25 farmers in  Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu.
Over the last three years, the  livelihood of more than 60 farmers have been improved through  this project and an increase in more than 75000 trees, planted  in rural Tamil Nadu through this project.
We have seen a number of natural calamities that occurred in  2013-2014 in India, in the states of Uttarakhand and Odisha and  also in other countries like the Philippines, claiming hundreds  of lives and resources.
As a part of the Wipro Cares charter of  supporting communities affected by disasters, we initiated  programs that focused on the long term rehabilitation of the  affected communities.
In the state of Uttarakhand, Wipro Cares finalized a project that  would work with 1000 families on exploring alternative modes of  livelihood to reduce their economic dependence on tourism and  also to equip the local communities with preparedness strategies  to tackle natural disasters in the future.
In the state of Odisha,  the chosen project will work towards restoring the livelihood of  250 families of the fishermen community from 15 villages of five  Gram Panchayats in Polasara Block of Ganjam District.
In the Philippines, through the Wipro BPO team we mobilized  funds by employees to contribute to the rehabilitation of people  affected by the Typhoon Haiyan.
The money was donated to  an organization called GMA Kapuso Foundation, a leading  organization in Philippines working on challenges faced by the  marginalized communities.
The Wipro Cares employee chapters across India and few  chapters overseas continue to be actively involved through  their engagement with social initiatives.
Employees choose  these initiatives based on their interests and use the Wipro Cares  platform to rope in people with similar interests and passion.
This year we saw our Maia office in Portugal join the list of  international chapters.
In nine locations across India, Wipro Cares organized a blood  donation drive for thallasaemics where 3696 units of blood  were collected.
We also continued celebrating ‘Joy of Giving @  Wipro, 2013’ across WT, WI, WBPO, WIN, WCCLG in 11 locations  in India and UAE.

Our position on CSR spending:  We reiterate our fundamental position that the quality of  outcomes of social issues is not necessarily related to the  quantum of spending.
Those familiar with social programs in  sectors like education, healthcare or livelihoods are only too  familiar with the reality that it is possible to spend a whole lot of  money and achieve little ; and by the same token, it is possible  to achieve high-leverage impacts with relatively low spending.
Our spend on core CSR initiatives during 2013-14 was of the order  of Rs 160 Mn ; however this does not include several important  heads of spending on our internal sustainability programs as  well as product development initiatives in the same space.
Examples include: Expenditure on Energy and Water efficiency,  Pollution Mitigation, Gender diversity and Persons with Disability  initiatives, our investments in business units like EcoEnergy, the  Smart Grids practice as well as digital inclusion solutions under  the Innovation program.
These constitute core dimensions of the  triple bottomline framework of sustainability and reinforce our  conviction that if business and social purposes have to achieve  some measure of consonance., CSR and business sustainability  must b e seen as part of the same charter.
Advocacy and Outreach Wipro’s Management Approach:  Given the fundamental axiom that sustainability is about maximizing social and environmental  ‘good’ , it requires an engagement template that emphasizes informed advocacy of the underlying issues amongst all stakeholders.
Each stakeholder – Business, Government, Academia, Civil Society – brings a dynamic and energy to the table that is unique and  complementary.
We think that industry’s role must go beyond its own boundaries and should be one that seeks to vigorously  promote advocacy of sustainability challenges.
In doing so, the conscious emphasis must be on the difficult and the long term  in preference to the easy and the short term.
Our areas of focus on policy and advocacy have centered around Clean Energy and Climate Change, Water, e-Waste, Education  and Diversity.
We work through industry platforms like CII, FICCI, Nasscom as well as with research partners who carry expertise  in these domains.
This section provides an overview of the work that we have been doing on policy and advocacy in the above mentioned domains  with an emphasis on the highlights for 2013-14.
Stakeholders and the primary issues: Our primary identified stakeholders for public policy and advocacy are • Relevant government ministries and departments, both at the center and the states where we operate in ; Our interactions  have been largely with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the Planning  Commission and Ministry of Corporate Affairs • Industry networks and associations play a crucial role as catalysts for awareness, advocacy and action on the multiple  dimensions of sustainability ; by providing a common platform for industry representatives to share and exchange ideas and  practices, industry association can help foster a virtuous cycle of feedback led improvement.
Industry networks also lend  strength and credibility in the dialogue process with government on important matters of policy and directives.
The industry  networks that we have been an integral part of are: 104 Annual Report 2013-14 • The CII-Godrej Green Business Center • The CII-ITC Center for Sustainable Development • The CII Climate Change Council • The Nasscom working groups on Gender Diversity • The FICCI Sustainability Forum • Research and Advocacy NGOs:  Issues like Energy, Climate Change, Water, Biodiversity, Community Education, Health etc  require strong civil society involvement as the third pillar after government policies and business engagement .
NGOs and  academic institutions, by combining the right blend of field work and academic rigor can generate valuable insights that can  inform the work of practitioners, policy makers and industry professionals.
Illustrative examples of such organizations that  we work with are : Biome and Acwadam in the area of Water, ATREE in the area of Biodiversity and our network of nearly 30  education partners across the country The table below provides a summary of our major stakeholder engagements in advocacy and outreach Domain Brief highlights Energy , Climate  Change, Water, e-Waste • Through the CII Climate Change Council, enhance awareness among industry on the role of  business in mitigating climate change ;  Advance advocacy and partnership with the Government of  India on matters of common interest.
Climate Change was also a central area of dialog and advocacy  of the CII Environment Committee and the FICCI Environment Forum • Water was a major area of collaborative focus for us in 2013-14.
The three major advocacy platforms  that we have been deeply involved in are (i) Convening the Karnataka State Water Network (KSWN) along with the CII Karnataka chapter.
The KSWN brings together stakeholders from government, academia, civil society and business  to address the most pressing issues in water in Bangalore and surrounding areas (ii) As part of the Electronic City Industry Township Association (ELCITA), we have set a goal  of creating a Sustainable Water Zone in E-city.
A comprehensive commissioned study was  completed in March 2014, basis which the action phase will start in 14-15 (iii) We initiated the next phase of the Responsible Water program that seeks to address the  pressing issue of ground water in the larger Sarjapur area in Bangalore through a combination  of scientific hydrogeology and committed citizen action • We have been part of the CII Environment Committee that convened multiple task groups during  2013-14 to focus on different issues of relevance.
Two of these task groups focused on e-Waste  and Solid Waste ; we played a central role in the progress of the e-Waste task group’s study and  recommendations Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) • We continued to engage in-depth with the Indian government - in particular, the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs - on the CSR provisions in the Companies Act 2013 and amendments thereto.
Our  CFO had contributed inputs to the committee set up by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (ICAI) to make detailed recommendations to the government on specific issues of the CSR  rules • Our primary position on the CSR provisions of Bill continues to be that CSR as a mandate may  not be the most effective means of getting industry to engage on larger social issues.
Second, we  believe that business sustainability plays a critical role in moving the needle forward and must be  included as part of CSR where appropriate.
Third, as a global corporate citizen, we think that CSR  must include community programs of all the countries that a company operates in and should not  be restricted to India School Education • The topic of ‘Textbooks’ was taken up as an area of advocacy in 2013-14 and an exhibition on  ‘Textbooks in Colonial India’ was held as a beginning.
We plan to follow this up in 2014-15 with an  online archive on textbooks and public events • Our 14th Partners’ Forum deliberated on the issue of ‘Textbooks and Education’ and was  attended by over 70 members from civil society organizations, academic institutions and education  department of various state governments  • Our projects received regular coverage in English and vernacular media; such as SeasonWatch  (Malayalam) and GoodBooks (English)   Wipro Limited 105 Domain Brief highlights Sustainability Literacy  and Education • Through earthian, Wipro’s flagship program in sustainability education for schools and colleges,  our goal is to act as catalysts for wider sustainability advocacy among the young in India’s schools  and colleges • Partnership with CEE (Center for Environment Education) to offer the program in Hindi in four  Hindi speaking states.
• Provided internships for college students with partner organisations on sustainability.
Diversity • During 2013-14, we also participated in industry research and advocacy on key Diverity and  Inclusion themes.
We continued our engagement with external stakeholders where we hold advisory  board / core committee positions, namely with Catalyst, NASSCOM and CII.
• Wipro is part of the core CII committee for employment of people with disabilities and also part  of the NASSCOM working group on gender inclusion • Catalyst is a leading nonprofit organization which works on expanding opportunities for women  and business.
Wipro CEO is chair of Catalyst India Advisory Board.
Plans and direction forward:  Our sustainability advocacy and outreach will continue to be based on the  three important pillars of   (i) Promoting decentralized, community-centric governance and management models that involve a wide range of stakeholders  (ii) Providing carefully crafted inputs policies on government policy and  (iii) Increasing awareness and fostering exchange through participation as speakers in a variety of forums, events and workshops  the right direction.
Our approach will be to continue to work with our network of academic and civil society partners  as well as  with industry networks.
We will strengthen and expand our partner network as appropriate .
The areas of focus for 2014-15 will be  • Energy and Climate Change • Water • Biodiversity • E-Waste • School Education, Sustainability Education and Education for Children with Disability • Gender Diversity 106 Annual Report 2013-14 SGS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED’S INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT ON THE WIPRO  LIMITED’S BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT FOR YEAR 2013 - 14 NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE ASSURANCE/VERIFICATION SGS India Private Limited was commissioned by Wipro Limited to conduct an independent assurance of their Business Responsibility Report (BRR) for the year 2013 – 14  and to issue Assurance Statement to be included in the Annual Report 2013 -14.

Significant accounting policies  i.
Basis of preparation of financial statements  The financial statements of the Company are prepared in  accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  in India (GAAP) under the historical cost convention on  the accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments  which are measured on a fair value basis.
GAAP comprises  Accounting Standards specified in the Companies  (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 (as amended),  Companies Act, 1956 (to the extent applicable), the  provisions of Companies Act, 2013 (to the extent notified  and applicable), Accounting Standards (‘AS’) issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and other  generally accepted accounting principles in India.
ii.
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date  of financial statements and reported amounts of income  and expenses during the year.
Estimates and underlying  assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revision  to accounting estimates is recognised in the year in which  the estimates are revised and in any future year affected.
iii.
Goodwill  The goodwill arising on acquisition of a group of assets is  not amortized and is tested for impairment if indicators of  impairment exist.
iv.
Tangible assets, intangible assets and Capital work- in-progress  Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss, if any.
Costs include  expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of  the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  construction or pro duction of qualifying assets are  capitalized as part of the cost.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid for  acquisition less accumulated amortization and impairment  loss, if any.
Cost of fixed assets not ready for use before the balance  sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets  outstanding as of each balance sheet date is disclosed  under long term loans and advances.
v.  Investments  Long term investments are stated at cost less other than  temporary diminution in the value of such investments, if  any.
Current investments are valued at lower of cost and  fair value determined by category of investment.
The fair  value is determined using quoted market price/market  observable information adjusted for cost of disposal.
On  disposal of the investment, the difference between its  carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or  credited to the statement of profit and loss.
vi.
Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost  is determined using the weighted average method.
Cost  of work-in-progress and finished goods include material  cost and appropriate share of manufacturing overheads.
Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs  of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the  inventories to their present location and condition.
vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of obligation.

Standalone Financial Statements 114 Annual Report 2013-14  viii.
Revenue recognition  Services:  The Company recognizes revenue when the significant  terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have  been delivered and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method of recognizing the revenues and costs  depends on the nature of the services rendered:  A.
Time and material contracts    Revenues and costs relating to time and material  contracts are recognized as the related services are  rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts    Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including  systems development and integration contracts are  recognized using the “percentage-of-completion”   method.
Percentage of completion is determined  based on project costs incurred to date as a  percentage of total estimated project costs required  to complete the project.
When total cost estimates  exceed revenues in an arrangement, the estimated  losses are recognized in the statement of profit  and loss in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ included in other current assets  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at  the balance sheet date.
‘Unearned revenues’ included  in other current liabilities represent billing in excess  of revenue recognized.
C.  Maintenance Contracts    Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized  ratably over the period of the contract using the  percentage of completion method.
When services are  performed through an indefinite number of repetitive  acts over a specified period of time, revenue is  recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified  period unless some other method better represents  the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or  output units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed  term.
In such contracts, revenue is recognized with  respect to the actual output achieved till date as a  percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual  service unutilized by the customer is recognized as  revenue on completion of the term.
Products:  Revenue from sale of products is recognised when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership has been  transferred in accordance with the sales contract.
Revenue  from product sales is shown gross of excise duty and net  of sales tax separately charged and applicable discounts.
Other income:  Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion method,  based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
ix.
Leases  Leases of assets, where the Company assumes substantially  all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as  finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the lower  of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the  present value of minimum lease payments.
Lease payments  are apportioned between the finance charge and the  outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to  periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate  of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease rentals in respect of assets taken under operating  leases are charged to statement of profit and loss on a  straight line basis over the lease term.
In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross finance receivables, unearned  income and the estimated residual value of the leased  equipment on consummation of such leases.
Unearned  income represents the excess of the gross finance lease  receivable plus the estimated residual value over the sales  price of the equipment.
The Company recognizes unearned  income as financing revenue over the lease term using the  effective interest method.
x.
Foreign currency transactions  The Company is exposed to currency fluctuations on foreign  currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions are  accounted in the books of account at the exchange rates  prevailing on the date of transaction.
Transaction:  The difference between the rate at which foreign currency  transactions are accounted and the rate at which they are  realized is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Translation:  Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities, other  than net investments in non-integral foreign operations, at  period-end are restated at the closing rate.
The difference  arising from the restatement is recognized in the statement  of profit and loss.
Exchange differences arising on the  translation of a monetary item that, in substance, forms  part of non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a  Standalone Financial Statements Wipro Limited 115 foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).
When a foreign  operation is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized  in FCTR is transferred to the statement of profit and loss as  part of the profit or loss on disposal.
In March 2009, Ministry of Corporate affairs issued a  notification amending AS 11, ‘The effects of changes in  foreign exchange rates’ .
This was further amended by  notification dated December 29, 2011.
Before the said  amendment, AS 11 required the exchange gains/losses  on long term foreign currency monetary assets/liabilities  to be recorded in the statement of profit and loss.
The amended AS 11 provides an irrevocable option to the  Company to amortise exchange rate fluctuation on long  term foreign currency monetary asset/liability over the  life of the asset/liability or March 31, 2020, whichever is  earlier.
The amendment is applicable retroactively from  the financial year beginning on or after December 7, 2006.
The Company did not elect to exercise this option.
xi.
Financial Instruments   Financial instruments are recognised when the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  instrument.
Derivative instruments and Hedge accounting:   The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in a  non-integral foreign operation and forecasted cash flows  denominated in foreign currency.

In accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles set out in AS 30, changes in fair value of derivative  financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are  recognised directly in shareholders’ funds and reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence  of the hedged transaction.
Change s in the fair value relating to the ineffective  portion of the hedges and derivative instruments that do  not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is  determined based on observable market inputs including  currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency  volatility etc.
xii.
Depreciation and amortization  The Company has provided for depreciation using straight  line method, at the rates specified in Schedule XIV to the  Companies Act, 1956, except in case of the following assets,  which are depreciated based on estimated useful life, which  is higher than the rates specified in Schedule XIV.

Reduction, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit  and loss.
If at the balance sheet date there is any indication  that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer  exists, the recognised impairment loss is reversed, subject  to maximum of initial carrying amount of the short-term  receivable.
Standalone Financial Statements 116 Annual Report 2013-14  Other than financial assets:   The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether  there is any indication that a non-financial asset including  goodwill may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable  amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset  belongs to is less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The reduction  is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
If at the balance sheet date  there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment  loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed  and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject  to a maximum of depreciated historical cost.
In respect of  goodwill, the impairment loss will be reversed only when  it was caused by specific external events of an exceptional  nature that is not expected to recur and their effects have  been reversed by subsequent external events.

During the previous year ended March 31, 2013, the  Company had initiated and completed the demerger of  Diversified Business.
The “Scheme of Arrangement” (‘the  Scheme’) involved transfer of the Diversified Business to a  “Resulting Company” [Wipro Enterprises Limited (formerly  known as Azim Premji Custodial Services Private Limited)]  whose equity shares are not listed in any stock exchange  in India or abroad.
The Scheme became effective on March 31, 2013 with an  appointed date of April 01, 2012 when the sanction of  the Honorable High Court of Karnataka and filing of the  certified copy of the same with the Registrar of Companies.
The Scheme of Demerger has been accounted for in terms  of the Court Orders and alterations or modifications as  approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and  the Resulting Company as provided for in the Scheme.
All the assets and liabilities relating to the Diversified  Business of the Company, on the appointed date, have  been transferred to the Resulting Company.

Tax Demands:   The Company had received tax demands aggregating  to  ` 42,883  (including interest of ` 12,907 ) arising primarily  on account of denial of deduction under section 10A of  the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by  the Company’s undertaking in Software Technology Park  at Bangalore for the years ended March 31, 2001 to  March  31, 2009.
The appeals filed against the said demand before  the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of  the Company by the second appellate authority for the  years up to March 31, 2007.
Further appeals have been  filed by the Income tax authorities before the Honorable  High Court.
For the year ended March 31, 2008 and 2009,  the appeal is pending before the Income Tax Appellate  Tribunal.

: 205385 Bangalore May 29, 2014 For and on behalf of the Board of Directors Azim Premji N Vaghul B C Prabhakar Chairman & Managing Director Director  Director       Suresh C Senapaty T K Kurien  V Ramachandran Chief Financial Officer Chief Executive Officer  Company Secretary & Executive Director & Executive Director Consolidated Financial Statements Wipro Limited 145 To the Board of Directors of Wipro Limited  We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Wipro Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively  called ‘the Group’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2014, the consolidated statement of profit and  loss and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other  explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the  consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the  requirements of Accounting Standard 21, Consolidated Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  (‘ICAI’).
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in  accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that  we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal  control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit  procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  entity’s internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  the accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the consolidated financial statements  give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India: (a)  in the case of the consolidated balance sheet, of the state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2014; (b)  in the case of the consolidated statement of profit and loss, of the profit of the Group for the year ended on that date; and (c)  in the case of the consolidated cash flow statement, of the cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.
Emphasis of matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to note 29 to the consolidated financial statements that describes the principles of  Accounting Standard (AS) 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements, followed by the Group, which has not currently  been notified by the National Advisory Council for Accounting Standards pursuant to the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules,  2006 as per Section 211(3C) of the Companies Act, 1956.
Had the Company not followed the principles of AS 30, the profit after taxation  for the year ended March 31, 2014 would have been lower by ` 839 million.

: 205385 Bangalore May 29, 2014 For and on behalf of the Board of Directors Azim Premji N Vaghul B C Prabhakar Chairman & Managing Director Director  Director       Suresh C Senapaty T K Kurien  V Ramachandran Chief Financial Officer Chief Executive Officer  Company Secretary & Executive Director & Executive Director Consolidated Financial Statements Wipro Limited 149 (` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Company overview  Wipro Limited (“Wipro” or the “Parent”), together with its  subsidiaries (collectively, “the Company” or “the Group”)  is a leading India based provider of IT Services, including  Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services and IT  products, globally.
During the previous year ended March 31, 2013, the  Company had initiated and completed the demerger of  other businesses such as consumer care and lighting,  infrastructure engineering business and other non IT  business of the Company (collectively, the “Diversified  Business” , refer note 28 for further details) into Wipro  Enterprises Limited (“Resulting Company”), a company  incorporated under the laws of India.
Wipro is headquartered  in Bangalore, India.
2.
Significant accounting policies  i.
Basis of preparation of financial statements  The financial statements are prepared in accordance with  Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)  under the historical cost convention on the accrual basis,  except for certain financial instruments which are measured  on a fair value basis.
GAAP comprises Accounting Standards  (AS), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India (ICAI) and other generally accepted accounting  principles in India.
ii.
Principles of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  on the following basis:  –  The consolidated financial statements include the  financial statements of Wipro and all its subsidiaries,  which are more than 50% owned or controlled.
The  financial statements of the parent company and its  majority owned / controlled subsidiaries have been  combined on a line by line basis by adding together  the book values of all items of assets, liabilities,  incomes and expenses after eliminating all inter- company balances / transactions and resulting  unrealized gain / loss.
–  The excess of the cost to the parent of its investments  in a subsidiary over the parent’s portion of equity at  the date on which investment in the subsidiary is  made, is recognised as ‘Goodwill’ .
When the cost to  the parent of its investment in a subsidiary is less  than the parent’s portion of equity of the subsidiary  at the date on which investment in the subsidiary is  made, the difference is treated as ‘Capital Reserve’ in  the consolidated financial statements.
–  Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated  subsidiaries consists of:   a)   the amount of equity attributable to the  minorities at the dates on which investment in  a subsidiary is made; and   b)   the minorities share of movements in equity  since the date of parent-subsidiary relationship  came into existence.
Minority interest in share of net result for the year is  identified and adjusted against the profit after tax.
Excess of loss, if any, attributable to the minority over  and above the minority interest in the equity of the  subsidiaries is absorbed by the Company.
–  The consolidated financial statements are prepared  using uniform accounting policies for similar  transactions and other events in similar circumstances.
iii.
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date  of financial statements and reported amounts of income  and expenses during the year.
Estimates and underlying  assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revision  to accounting estimates is recognised in the year in which  the estimates are revised and in any future year affected.
iv.
Tangible assets, intangible assets and capital work- in-progress  Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss, if any.
Costs include  expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of  the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  construction or production of qualifying assets are  capitalized as part of the cost.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid for  acquisition less accumulated amortization and impairment  loss, if any.
Cost of fixed assets not ready for use before the balance  sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets  outstanding as of each balance sheet date is disclosed  under long term loans and advances.
v.  Investments  Non-current investments are stated at cost less other than  temporary diminution in the value of such investments, if  Consolidated Financial Statements 150 Annual Report 2013-14 any.
Current investments are valued at lower of cost and  fair value determined by category of investment.
The fair  value is determined using quoted market price/market  observable information adjusted for cost of disposal.
On  disposal of the investment, the difference between its  carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or  credited to the statement of profit and loss.
vi.
Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost  is determined using the weighted average method.
Cost  of work-in-progress and finished goods include material  cost and appropriate share of manufacturing overheads.
Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs  of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the  inventories to their present location and condition.
vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of obligation.
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is  a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but  probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where  there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in  respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is  remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the  expected benefits to be derived from the contract are  lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the future  obligations under the contract.
viii.
Revenue recognition  Services:  The Company recognizes revenue when the significant  terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have  been delivered and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method for recognizing revenues and costs depends  on the nature of the services rendered: A.
Time and material contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and material contracts  are recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized  using the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage  of completion is determined based on project costs  incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated  project costs required to complete the project.
When  total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of  profit and loss in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ included in other current assets  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at the  balance sheet date.
‘Unearned revenues’ included in other  current liabilities represent billing in excess of revenue  recognized.
C.  Maintenance contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably  over the period of the contract using the percentage of  completion method.
When services are performed through  an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified  period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the specified period unless some other method  better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output  units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term.
In such  contracts, revenue is recognized with respect to the  actual output achieved till date as a percentage of total  contractual output.
Any residual service unutilized by the  customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the  term.
Products:  Revenue from sale of products is recognised when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership has been  transferred in accordance with the sales contract.
Revenues  from product sales are shown gross of excise duty and net  of sales tax separately charged and applicable discounts.
Other income:  Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion method,  based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
ix.
Leases  Leases of assets, where the Company assumes substantially  all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as  finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the lower  of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the  present value of minimum lease payments.
Lease payments  are apportioned between the finance charge and the  outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to  periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate  of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Consolidated Financial Statements Wipro Limited 151 Lease rentals in respect of assets taken under operating  leases are charged to profit and loss account on a straight  line basis over the lease term.
In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross finance receivables, unearned  income and the estimated residual value of the leased  equipment on consummation of such leases.
Unearned  income represents the excess of the gross finance lease  receivable plus the estimated residual value over the sales  price of the equipment.
The Company recognizes unearned  income as financing revenue over the lease term using the  effective interest method.
x.
Foreign currency transactions  Transaction:  The Company is exposed to currency fluctuations on foreign  currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions are  accounted in the books of account at the exchange rates  prevailing on the date of transaction.
Translation:  Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities at period- end are translated at the closing rate.
The difference arising  from the translation is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss, except for the exchange difference arising  on monetary items that qualify as hedging instruments in  a cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a non- integral foreign operation.
In such cases the exchange  difference is initially recognised in hedging reserve or  Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR), respectively.
Such exchange differences are subsequently recognised  in the statement of profit and loss on occurrence of  the underlying hedged transaction or on disposal of  the investment, respectively.
Further, foreign currency  differences arising from translation of intercompany  receivables or payables relating to foreign operations,  the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in  the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of net  investment in foreign operation and are recognized in  FCTR.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant  amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the statement  of profit and loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Integral operations:  Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing at the date of the balance sheet.
Non-monetary items are translated at the historical rate.
The items in the statement of profit and loss are translated  at the average exchange rate during the period.

Adoption of AS 30   The Company has applied the principles of AS 30, as per  announcement by ICAI, to the extent such principles of AS  30 does not conflict with existing accounting standards  prescribed by Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules,  2006.  i)   As permitted by AS 30, the Company has designated  a USD-denominated foreign currency borrowing  amounting to USD 150 million as a hedging  instrument to hedge its net investment in a non- integral foreign operation.
ii)   Accordingly, the translation gain/ (loss) on the foreign  currency borrowings and portion of the changes in  fair value of CCIRS/IRS which are determined to be  effective hedge of net investment in non-integral  operation and cash flow hedge of foreign currency  borrowings aggregating to ` (705) for the year ended  March 31, 2014 [2013: ` (896)] was recognised in  translation reserve / hedging reserve in shareholders’  funds.
The amount of gain/ (loss) of ` (839) for the  year ended March 31, 2014 [2013: ` (868)] recognised  in translation reserve would be transferred to profit  and loss account upon sale or disposal of the non- integral foreign operation and the amount of gain /  (loss) of ` 134 for year ended March 31, 2014 [2013:  ` (28)] recognised in the hedging reserve would be  transferred to the statement of profit and loss on the  occurrence of the hedged transaction.
The gain of  ` 416 has been transferred to statement of profit and  loss on occurrence of the hedged transaction (2013:  Nil).
iii)   In accordance with AS 11, if the Company had  continued to recognize translation (losses)/ gains on  foreign currency borrowing in the statement of profit  and loss:   a.
Foreign currency borrowing of $150Mn would  not have been eligible as a hedge instrument  for hedge accounting and changes in the fair  value of the foreign currency borrowing would  have to be recognized in the statement of profit  and loss.
As a result profit after tax would have  been lower by ` 839 for the year ended March  31, 2014 (2013: Nil).
b.
Foreign currency borrowing of JPY 24.5Bn would  not have been eligible to be combined with  CCIRS for hedge accounting.
Consequently, the  CCIRS also would not have qualified for hedge  accounting and changes in fair value of CCIRS  would have to be recognized in the statement of  profit and loss.
As a result profit after tax would  have been lower by Nil for the year ended March  31, 2014 (2013: ` 896).

These consolidated financial statements are the  responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements  based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of the Company as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year period ended March 31, 2014, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by International  Accounting Standards Board.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wipro  Limited’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated  Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated  May 18, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

2.
Basis of preparation of financial statements  (i)  Statement of compliance  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  and its interpretations (“IFRS”), as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
(ii)  Basis of preparation  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  compliance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Accounting policies  have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements correspond to the  classification provisions contained in IAS 1(revised), “Presentation  of Financial Statements” .
For clarity, various items are aggregated  in the statements of income and statements of financial position.
These items are disaggregated separately in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements, where applicable.
All amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  are reported in millions of Indian rupees (rupees in millions)  except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated.
Due to  rounding off, the numbers presented throughout the document  may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not  precisely reflect the absolute figures.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation  the comparative income statement is re-presented as if  the operation had been discontinued from the start of the  comparative period.
The Company has retrospectively applied  the discontinued operation presentation from the start of the  comparative period.
(iii)  Basis of measurement  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for  the following material items which have been measured at fair  value as required by relevant IFRS:-  a.
Derivative financial instruments;  b.  Available-for-sale financial assets; and  c.  The defined benefit asset is recognised as plan assets less  the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
(iv)  Convenience translation (unaudited)  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been  prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the national currency of  India.
Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated  financial statements as of and for the year ended March  31,  2014, have been translated into United States dollars at the  certified foreign exchange rate of US$1 = ` 60.00, as published  by Federal Reserve Board of Governors on March 31, 2014.
No  representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have  been, could have been or could be converted into United States  dollars at such a rate or any other rate.
(v)  Use of estimates and judgment   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in  conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from  those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized  in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future  periods affected.
In particular, information about significant  areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in  applying accounting policies that have the most significant  effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial  statements is included in the following notes:  a)  Revenue recognition: The Company uses the percentage of  completion method using the input (cost expended) method to  measure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price  contracts.
Percentage of completion method accounting relies  on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs.
This  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 191 method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates  of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of  the contract can be made.
Key factors that are reviewed in  estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of  future labor costs and productivity efficiencies.
Because the  financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts,  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the  contract progresses to completion.
When estimates indicate  that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period  in which the loss becomes probable.
b)  Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that  the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than  its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of cash generating  units is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair  value less cost to sell.
The calculation involves use of significant  estimates and assumptions which includes revenue growth rates  and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash  flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market  conditions.
c)  Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company  are India and the United States of America.
Significant judgments  are involved in determining the provision for income taxes  including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of  being sustained in tax assessments.
A tax assessment can involve  complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time  periods.
d)  Deferred taxes : Deferred tax is recorded on temporary  differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted  or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The ultimate  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the  generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which  those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become  deductible.
The Company considers the expected reversal of  deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in  making this assessment.
The amount of the deferred income  tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in  the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the  carry-forward period are reduced.
e)  Business combination : In accounting for business  combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an  identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from  goodwill.
Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value  of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent  consideration assumed involves management judgment.
These measurements are based on information available at the  acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions  that have been deemed reasonable by management.
Changes  in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially  affect the results of operations.
f )  Other estimates : The preparation of financial statements  involves estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities  at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of  revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Specifically, the  Company estimates the uncollectability of accounts receivable by  analyzing historical payment patterns, customer concentrations,  customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends.
If  the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, additional  allowances may be required.
Similarly, the Company provides  for inventory obsolescence, excess inventory and inventories  with carrying values in excess of net realizable value based  on assessment of the future demand, market conditions and  specific inventory management initiatives.
If market conditions  and actual demands are less favorable than the Company’s  estimates, additional inventory provisions may be required.
In all  cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost and net  realizable value.
The stock compensation expense is determined  based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will  eventually vest.
3.
Significant accounting policies  (i)  Basis of consolidation  Subsidiaries  The Company determines the basis of control in line with  requirements of IFRS 10.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group  controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to affect those returns through its power over the  entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  the consolidated financial statements from the date on which  control commences until the date on which control ceases.
All intra-company balances, transactions, income and expenses  including unrealized income or expenses are eliminated in full  on consolidation.
Equity accounted investees  Equity accounted investees are entities in respect of which  the Company has significant influence, but not control, over  the financial and operating policies.
Interest in associates  is accounted for using the equity method.
They are initially  recorded at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the  consolidated financial statements include the Company’s share  of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) of  equity accounted investees, until the date on which significant  influence ceases.
Non-controlling interest  Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill)  of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the  Company’s equity.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders  may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non- controlling interest’s proportionate share of the fair value of the  acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement  basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis.
Subsequent  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 192 Annual Report 2013-14 to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest  is the amount of those interest at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling  interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having  a deficit balance.
(ii)  Functional and presentation currency  Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each  of the Company’s subsidiaries and equity accounted investees  are measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which these entities operate (i.e.
the “functional  currency”).
These consolidated financial statements are  presented in Indian rupees, the national currency of India, which  is the functional currency of Wipro Limited and its domestic  subsidiaries and equity accounted investees.
(iii)  Foreign currency transactions and translation  a)  Transactions and balances  Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the respective  functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the  dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the  translation at the exchange rates prevailing at reporting date of  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are recognized in the statement of income and reported within  foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results of operating  activities.
Gains/losses relating to translation or settlement of  borrowings denominated in foreign currency are reported within  finance expense except foreign exchange gains/losses on short- term borrowings, which are considered as a natural economic  hedge for the foreign currency monetary assets and are classified  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results from operating activities.
Non monetary assets and  liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at  historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at  the date of transaction.
b)  Foreign operations  For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial  statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign  operations that have local functional currency are translated  into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing at the  reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the  average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences  arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income  and held in foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a  component of equity.
When a foreign operation is disposed off,  the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the  statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of  the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate  prevailing at the reporting  date.
c)  Others  Foreign currency differences arising on the translation or  settlement of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a  net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in other  comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR  to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent the hedge  is ineffective, such difference are recognized in statement of  income.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed  off, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred  to the statement of income as part of the profit or loss on  disposal.
Foreign currency differences arising from translation  of intercompany receivables or payables relating to foreign  operations, the settlement of which is neither planned nor  likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of  net investment in foreign operation and are recognized in FCTR.
(iv)  Financial Instruments  a)  Non-derivative financial instruments  Non derivative financial instruments consist of:  –  financial assets, which include cash and cash equivalents,  trade receivables, unbilled revenues, finance lease  receivables, employee and other advances, investments  in equity and debt securities and eligible current and non- current assets;  – financial liabilities, which include long and short-term loans  and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payable, eligible  current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Non derivative financial instruments are recognized initially  at fair value including any directly attributable transaction  costs.
Financial assets are derecognized when substantial risks  and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been  transferred.
In cases where substantial risks and rewards of  ownership of the financial assets are neither transferred nor  retained, financial assets are derecognized only when the  Company has not retained control over the financial asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non derivative financial  instruments are measured as described below:  A.
Cash and cash equivalents  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on  hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which  can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty  on the principal.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash  equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits  with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable  on demand and are considered part of the Company’s cash  management system.
B.  Available-for-sale financial assets  The Company has classified investments in liquid mutual funds,  equity securities, other than equity accounted investees and  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 193 certain debt securities (primarily certificate of deposits with  banks) as available-for-sale financial assets.
These investments  are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized  in other comprehensive income and presented within equity,  net of taxes.
The impairment losses, if any, are reclassified from  equity into statement of income.
When an available for sale  financial asset is derecognized, the related cumulative gain or  loss in equity is transferred to statement of income.
C.  Loans and receivables  Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with  fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an  active market.
They are presented as current assets, except  for those maturing later than 12 months after the reporting  date which are presented as non-current assets.
Loans and  receivables are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction  costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the  effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and  receivables comprise trade receivables, unbilled revenues, cash  and cash equivalents and other assets.
D.  Trade and other payables  Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value,  and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective  interest method.
For these financial instruments, the carrying  amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of  these instruments.
b)  Derivative financial instruments  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on  foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign  operations and forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign  currency.
The Company limits the effect of foreign exchange rate  fluctuations by following established risk management policies  including the use of derivatives.
The Company enters into  derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is a  bank.
Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value.
Attributable transaction cost are recognized in statement of  income as cost.
A.
Cash flow hedges  Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument  designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other  comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve,  a component of equity to the extent that the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value  are recognized in the statement of income and reported within  foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results from operating  activities.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for  hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
The cumulative  gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve  is transferred to the statement of income upon the occurrence of  the rela ted forecasted transaction.
If the forecasted transaction  is no longer expected to occur, such cumulative balance is  immediately recognized in the statement of income.
B.  Hedges of net investment in foreign operations  The Company designates derivative financial instruments as  hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Company  has also designated a combination of foreign currency  denominated borrowings and related cross-currency swaps as  a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
Changes in the  fair value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses  on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign  operations are recognized in other comprehensive income  and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that the  hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective,  changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results from operating activities.
C.  Others  Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  not designated as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment  in foreign operations are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results from operating activities.
Changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign  currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which  have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance  expense.
(v)  Equity and share capital  a)  Share capital and share premium  The Company has only one class of equity shares.
The authorized  share capital of the Company is 2,650,000,000 equity shares, par  value ` 2 per share.
Par value of the equity shares is recorded as  share capital and the amount received in excess of par value is  classified as share premium.
Subsequent to March 31, 2014, the  authorized share capital of the Company has been increased to  2,917,500,000.
Every holder of the equity shares, as reflected in the records of the  Company as of the date of the shareholder meeting shall have  one vote in respect of each share held for all matters submitted  to vote in the shareholder meeting.
b)  Shares held by controlled trust (Treasury shares)  The Company’s equity shares held by the controlled trust, which  is consolidated as a part of the Group are classified as Treasury  Shares.
The Company has 14,841,271 and 16,640,212 treasury  shares as of March  31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Treasury  shares are recorded at acquisition cost.
c)  Retained earnings  Retained earnings comprises of the Company’s prior years’   undistribute d earnings after taxes.
A portion of these earnings  amounting to ` 1,139 is not freely available for distribution.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 194 Annual Report 2013-14 d)  Share based payment reserve  The share based payment reserve is used to record the value  of equity-settled share based payment transactions with  employees.
The amounts recorded in share based payment  reserve are transferred to share premium upon exercise of stock  options by employees.
e) Cash flow hedging reserve  Changes in fair value of derivative hedging instruments  designated and effective as a cash flow hedge are recognized  in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented  within equity in the cash flow hedging reserve.
f)  Foreign currency translation reserve  The exchange difference arising from the translation of financial  statements of foreign subsidiaries, differences arising from  translation of long-term intercompany receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, changes in fair value of the  derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation  or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings  designated as hedge of net investment in foreign operations  are recognized in other comprehensive income, and presented  within equity in the FCTR.
g)  Other reserve  Changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets is  recognized in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and  presented within equity in other reserve.
h)  Dividend  A final dividend, including tax thereon, on common stock  is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the  shareholders.
An interim dividend, including tax thereon, is  recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board  of directors.
(vi)  Property, plant and equipment  a)  Recognition and measurement  Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Cost  includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition  of the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized  as part of the cost.
b)  Depreciation  The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over  the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis from the date  the assets are available for use.
Assets acquired under finance  lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the  shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease  term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful  life of assets are reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted,  annually.
The estimated useful lives of assets for the current and  comparative period are as follows:  Category Useful life  Buildings  30 to 60 years Plant and machinery  2 to 21 years Computer equipment and software  2 to 6 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment  3 to 10 years Vehicles  4 years When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and  equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with these will flow to the  Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Deposits and advances paid towards the acquisition of property,  plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date and  the cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use  before such date are disclosed under capital work- in-progress.
(vii)  Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible assets  a)  Business combination  Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase  (acquisition) method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured  as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued  and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent  liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured  initially at fair value at the date of an acquisition.
Transaction  costs incurred in connection with a business combination are  expensed as incurred.
The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any  contingent consideration.
Any subsequent changes to the fair  value of contingent consideration classified as liabilities are  recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
b)  Goodwill  The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company’s share  in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and  contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill.
If the excess is  negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in  the statement of income.
c)  Intangible assets  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of an  acquisition.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination  are measured at fair value as at the date of an acquisition.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost  less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.
The amortization of an intangible asset with a finite useful life  reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected  to be generated and consumed.
Intangible assets with indefinite  lives comprising of brands are not amortized, but instead  tested for impairment at least annually and written down to the  recoverable amount as required.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 195 The estimated useful life of amortizable intangibles are reviewed  and where appropriate are adjusted, annually.
The estimated  useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current  and comparative periods are as follows:  Category Useful life  Customer-related intangibles 2 to 11 years Marketing related intangibles 20 to 30 years (viii)  Leases  The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains,  a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the  inception date.
The arrangement is assessed for whether  fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to  use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified  in an arrangement.
a)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessee  Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Company  assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are  classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the  lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present  value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are  apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding  liability.
The finance charge is allocated to periods during the  lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining  balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments  made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of  income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessor  In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross finance receivables, unearned income  and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment on  consummation of such leases.
Unearned income represents the  excess of the gross finance lease receivable plus the estimated  residual value over the sales price of the equipment.
The  Company recognizes unearned income as financing revenue  over the lease term using the effective interest method.
(ix)  Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost is  determined using the weighted average method.
(x)  Impairment  a)  Financial assets  The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there  is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the amount of impairment loss.
A.
Loans and receivables  Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized  using separate allowance accounts.
Refer Note 2 (v) for further  information regarding the determination of impairment.
B.
Available for sale financial asset  When the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets declines  below acquisition cost and there is objective evidence that  the asset is impaired, the cumulative gain/loss that has been  recognized in other comprehensive income, a component of  equity in other reserve is transferred to the statement of income.
An impairment loss may be reversed in subsequent periods, if  the indicators for the impairment no longer exist.
Such reversals  are recognized in other comprehensive income.
b)  Non financial assets  The Company assesses long-lived assets, such as property,  plant, equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not  be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of  assets.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating  unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) and  its value-in-use (VIU).
If the recoverable amount of the asset  or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to  which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the  carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The  reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized  in the statement of income.
If at the reporting date there is an  indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer  exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment  losses previously recognized are reversed such that the asset is  recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written  down value which would have been reported if the impairment  losses had not been recognized initially.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives comprising of brands  are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least  annually at the same time and written down to the recoverable  amount as required.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same  time and when events occur or changes in circumstances  indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating  unit is less than its carrying value.
The goodwill impairment test  is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of  cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which  goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
An  impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
(xi)  Employee Benefit  a)  Post-employment and pension plans  The Group participates in various employee benefit plans.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as  either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.
Under  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 196 Annual Report 2013-14 a defined contribution plan, the Company’s only obligation  is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further  contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay  all employee benefits.
The related actuarial and investment risks  fall on the employee.
The expenditure for defined contribution  plans is recognized as an expense during the period when the  employee provides service.
Under a defined benefit plan, it is  the Company’s obligation to provide agreed benefits to the  employees.
The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the  Company.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations  is calculated using the projected unit credit method.
During the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company has applied  IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) Employee Benefits and the  related consequential amendments.
IAS 19R has been applied  retrospectively in accordance with transitional provisions.
As a  result, all actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized in  other comprehensive income and permanently excluded from  profit or loss.
Further, the profit or loss will no longer include an  expected return on plan assets.
Instead net interest recognized  in profit or loss is calculated by applying the discount rate used  to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined  benefit liability or asset.
The actual return on the plan assets  above or below the discount rate is recognized as part of re- measurement of net defined liability or asset through other  comprehensive income.
The adoption of Revised IAS 19 did not  have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Also, the comparative information has not been restated as the  cumulative effect of the change in the accounting policy is not  material to the consolidated financial statements.
The company has the following employee benefit plans:  A.  Provident fund  Employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a  defined benefit plan.
The employer and employees each make  periodic contributions to the plan.
A portion of the contribution  is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the  Company; while the remainder of the contribution is made to  the government administered pension fund.
The Company is  generally liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the  government specified minimum rates of return.
B.  Superannuation  Superannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is  administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI  Prudential Insurance Company Limited.
The Company makes  annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each  eligible employee’s salary.
C.  Gratuity  In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the  Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible  employees, at retirement or termination of employment based  on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the  Company.
The gratuity fund is managed by the Life Insurance  Corporation of India (LIC), HDFC Standard Life, TATA AIG and  Birla Sun-life.
The Company’s obligation in respect of the gratuity  plan, which is a defined benefit plan, is provided for based on  actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The  Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in  other comprehensive income.
b)  Termination benefits  Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when  the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic  possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate  employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide  termination benefit as a result of an offer made to encourage  voluntary redundancy.
c)  Short-term benefits  Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an  undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related  service is provided.
A liability is recognized for the amount  expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit- sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive  obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided  by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
d)  Compensated absences  The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated  absences.
The employees can carry forward a portion of the  unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it  in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination  of employment.
The Company records an obligation for  compensated absences in the period in which the employee  renders the services that increases this entitlement.
The  Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences  as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a  result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end  of the reporting period.
The Company recognizes accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the  projected unit credit method.
Non-accumulating compensated  absences are recognized in the period in which the absences  occur.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses  immediately in the statement of income.
(xii)  Share based payment transaction  Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of  equity settled instruments, for rendering services over a defined  vesting period.
Equity instruments granted are measured  by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date  of grant.
In cases, where equity instruments are granted at a  nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant  approximates the fair value.
The expense is recognized in the  statement of income with a corresponding increase to the share  based payment reserve, a component of equity.
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded manner over  the vesting period.
The fair value determined at the grant date is  expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of  such grants (accelerated amortization).
The stock compensation  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 197 expense is determined based on the Company’s estimate of  equity instruments that will eventually vest.
(xiii)   Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required  to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of  the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of  the consideration required to settle the present obligation at  the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a  provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the  receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that  reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable  can be measured reliably.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the  expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract  are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future  obligations under the contract.
Provisions for onerous contracts  are measured at the present value of lower of the expected  net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of  terminating the contract.
(xiv)  Revenue  The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development and related services, BPO services, sale of IT and  other products.
a)  Services  The Company recognizes revenue when the significant terms of  the arrangement are enforceable, services have been delivered  and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method for  recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the  services rendered:  A.
Time and materials contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are  recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized using  the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage of  completion is determined based on project costs incurred to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required  to complete the project.
The cost expended (or input) method  has been used to measure progress towards completion as  there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure  the progress of completion or to estimate the total contract  revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent  of contra ct cost incurred for which recoverability is probable.
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of income  in the period in which such losses become probable based on  the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ represent cost and earnings in excess of  billings as at the end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned revenues’  represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.
Advance  payments received from customers for which no services have  been rendered are presented as ‘Advance from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance contract  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over  the period of the contract using the percentage of completion  method.
When services are performed through an indefinite  number of repetitive acts over a specified period of time,  revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified  period unless some other method better represents the stage  of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is  agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term.
In such contracts, revenue  is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved till  date as a percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual  service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on  completion of the term.
b)  Products  Revenue from products are recognized when the significant  risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer,  continuing managerial involvement usually associated with  ownership and effective control have ceased, the amount of  revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic  benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company  and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the  transaction can be measured reliably.
c)  Multiple element arrangements  Revenue from contracts with multiple-element arrangements  are recognized using the guidance in IAS 18, Revenue.
The  Company allocates the arrangement consideration to separately  identifiable components based on their relative fair values  or on the residual method.
Fair values are determined based  on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold  separately, third-party prices for similar components or cost  plus, an appropriate business-specific profit margin related to  the relevant component.
d)  Others  The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing  incentives to customers by reducing the amount of revenue  recognized at the time of sale.
Revenues are shown net of sales tax, value added tax, service  tax and applicable discounts and allowances.
Revenue includes  excise duty.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 198 Annual Report 2013-14 The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties at the  time when the revenue is recognized.
The accruals are based  on the Company’s historical experience of material usage and  service delivery costs.
(xv)  Finance expense  Finance expense comprise interest cost on borrowings,  impairment losses recognized on financial assets, gains / (losses)  on translation or settlement of foreign currency borrowings  and changes in fair value and gains / (losses) on settlement of  related derivative instruments except foreign exchange gains/ (losses), net on short-term borrowings which are considered as  a natural economic hedge for the foreign currency monetary  assets which are classified as foreign exchange gains / (losses),  net within results from operating activities.
Borrowing costs that  are not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognized  in the statement of income using the effective interest method.
(xvi)  Finance and other income  Finance and other income comprises interest income on  deposits, dividend income and gains / (losses) on disposal of  available-for-sale financial assets.
Interest income is recognized  using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is  recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
(xvii) Income tax  Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax  expense is recognized in the statement of income except to  the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly  recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.
a)  Current income tax  Current income tax for the current and prior periods are  measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or  paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income  for the period.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the  current tax amount are those that are enacted or substantively  enacted by the reporting date and applicable for the period.
The  Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized  amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or  to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.
b)  Deferred income tax  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet  approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are  recognized for deductible and taxable temporary differences  arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amount in financial statements, except when  the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of  goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable  profits or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax asset are recognized to the extent that it  is probable that taxable profit will be available against which  the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of  unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,  associates and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal  of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable  that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable  future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to  allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset  is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date.
The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets  against current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by  the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity, or  on different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle  the current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax  assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
(xviii) Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted  for treasury shares held.
Diluted earnings per share is computed  using the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive  equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the  treasury stock method for options and warrants, except where  the results would be anti-dilutive.
(xix) Discontinued operations  A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’s  business that represents a separate line of business that has  been disposed off or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired  exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued  operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the  operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
A demerger that is a business under common control is outside  the scope of IFRS 3, Business Combination and IFRIC 17, Non- Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and  can be accounted using either carrying values or fair values.
The Company accounts for such demergers at carrying value.
New Accounting standards adopted by the Company:  The Company has, with effect from April  1, 2013, adopted  the following new accounting standards and amendments to  accounting standards, including any consequential amendments  to other accounting standards.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 199 Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”  that will improve and align the presentation of items of other  comprehensive income (OCI) in financial statements prepared  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  (IFRSs).
Consequent to the adoption of Amendments to IAS 1,  the Company has modified the presentation of items of other  comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of  comprehensive income, to present separately items that may  be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss from those that  will not be.
The adoption of amendment to IAS 1 has no impact  on the recognised assets, liabilities and comprehensive income  of the Company.
Amendments to IFRS 7 * “Financial Instruments Disclosures”  the amended standard requires additional disclosures where  financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the statement  of financial position.
These disclosures will provide users with  information that is useful in (a) evaluating the effect or potential  effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position  and (b) analyzing and comparing financial statements prepared  in accordance with IFRSs and U.S. GAAP .
IFRS 10 * “Consolidated Financial Statements (2011)” The  new standard establishes principles for the presentation and  preparation of consolidated financial statements when an  entity controls one or more other entities.
IFRS 10 replaces the  consolidation requirements in SIC-12 “Consolidation—Special  Purpose Entities” and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate  Financial Statements” .
IFRS 10 builds on existing principles by  identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in  whether an entity should be included within the consolidated  financial statements of the parent company.
The standard  provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of  control where this is difficult to assess.
IFRS 12 * “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” This standard  provides comprehensive disclosure requirements for all forms  of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements,  associates, special purpose entities.
The objective of the standard  is to enable the entities to disclose the significant judgement  and assumptions it has made in determining:  i)  the nature of its interest in another entity or arrangement,  i.e control, joint control or significant influence.
ii)  The type of joint arrangement when the joint arrangement  is structured through separate vehicle  IFRS 13 * “Fair Value Measurement” The new standard defines fair  value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair  value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 applies when other IFRSs require or permit fair value  measurements.
It does not introduce any new requirements  to measure an asset or a liability at fair value or change what  is measured at fair value in IFRSs or address how to present  changes in fair value.
IAS 19 * “Employee Benefits (2011)” The new standard has  eliminated an option to defer the recognition of gains and losses  through re-measurements and requires such gain or loss to be  recognized through other comprehensive income in the year of  occurrence to reduce volatility.
The amended standard requires  immediate recognition of effects of any plan amendments.
Further it also requires return on assets in profit or loss to  be restricted to government bond yields or corporate bond  yields, considered for valuation of Projected Benefit Obligation,  irrespective of actual portfolio allocations.
The actual return from  the portfolio in excess of or less than such yields is recognized  through Other Comprehensive Income.
*  the adoption of these accounting standards including  consequential amendments did not have any material impact  on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
New Accounting standards not yet adopted by the Company:  A number of new standards, amendments to standards and  interpretations are not yet effective for annual periods beginning  after 1 April 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these  consolidated financial statements.
These are:  In November 2009, the IASB issued the chapter of IFRS 9 “Financial  Instruments relating to the classification and measurement of  financial assets” .
The new standard represents the first phase of  a three-phase project to replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments:  Recognition and Measurement” (IAS 39) with IFRS 9 Financial  Instruments (IFRS 9).
IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine  whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair  value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39.
The approach  in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial assets  (its business model) and the contractual cash flow characteristics  of the financial assets.
In October 2010, the IASB added the  requirement relating to classification and measurement of  financial liabilities to IFRS 9.
Under the amendment, an entity  measuring its financial liability at fair value, can present the  amount of fair value change attributable to entity’s own credit  risk in other comprehensive income.
Further the IASB also  decided to carry-forward unchanged from IAS 39 requirements  relating to de-recognition of financial assets and financial  liabilities.
The effective date to adopt IFRS 9 is yet to be notified.
The Company is evaluating the impact these amendments will  have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2011, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 32  “Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities” .
The purpose  of the amendment is to clarify some of the requirements  for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the  statements of financial position.
This includes clarifying the  meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right to set- off” and also the application of the IAS 32 offsetting criteria to  settlement systems (such as central clearing house systems)  which apply gross settlement mechanisms that are not  simultaneous.
The amendment is effective retrospectively  for fiscal years beginning on or after January  1, 2014.
Earlier  application is permitted.
These amendments are not expected to  have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial  statements.

Demerger of diversified business and discontinued  operations  During the financial year 2012-13, the Company had initiated  and completed the demerger of its consumer care and lighting,  infrastructure engineering and other non-IT business segment  (collectively, “the Diversified Business”).
The scheme was effective  March 31, 2013 after the sanction of the Honorable High Court  of Karnataka and filing of the certified copy of the scheme with  the Registrar of Companies.
Following the Effective Date, the Diversified Business is classified  and presented in the consolidated financial statements as  discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 – Non-Current  Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
The Demerger  is considered as business under common control and hence  is outside the scope of application of IFRS 3 and International  Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations’ (‘IFRIC’) 17.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the Diversified Business as  on the Effective Date are at their carrying values.

As of March  31, 2014, the estimated remaining amortization  period for customer-related intangibles acquired on acquisition  are as follows:  Acquisition Estimated remaining  amortization period  Citi Technology Services Limited 0.75 years Science Application International  Corporation 0.25 – 7.25  years Promax Applications Group 0.25 – 8.25  years Opus Capital Markets Consultants  LLC 0.25 – 6.75  years Goodwill  and indefinite life intangibles were tested for  impairment annually in accordance with the Company’s  procedure for determining the recoverable value of such assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to  a CGU representing the lowest level within the Group at which  goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes,  and which is not higher than the Group’s operating segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its FVLCTS  and its VIU.
The FVLCTS of the CGU is determined based on the  market capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings  multiples derived from observable market data.
The VIU is  determined based on discounted cash flow projections.
Key  assumptions on which the Company has based its determination  of VIUs include:  a)  Estimated cash flows for five years based on formal/ approved internal management budgets with extrapolation for  the remaining period, wherever such budgets were shorter than  5 years period.
b)  Terminal value arrived by extrapolating last forecasted  year cash flows to perpetuity using long-term growth rates.
These long-term growth rates take into consideration external  macroeconomic sources of data.
Such long-term growth rate  considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and  industry sector.
c)  The discount rates used are based on the Company’s  weighted average cost of capital as an approximation of the  weighted average cost of capital of a comparable market  participant, which are adjusted for specific country risks.
d)  Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions.
The  use of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that  is materially different from the value-in-use that would result if  the calculation was performed using before tax assumptions.
The  before tax discount rate is determined based on the value-in-use  derived from the use of after tax assumptions.
Assumptions Y ear ended March 31,   2013  2014  Terminal value long- term  growth rate 2%-6 % 5 % After tax discount rate 10%-15.5 % 16.5 % Before tax discount rate 11.7%-23.1 % 22.6 % Based on the above, no impairment was identified as of  March 31, 2013 and 2014 as the recoverable value of the CGUs  exceeded the carrying value.
Further, none of the CGU’s tested  for impairment as of March  31, 2013 and 2014 were at risk  of impairment.
An analysis of the calculation’s sensitivity to  a change in the key parameters (Revenue growth, operating  margin, discount rate and long-term growth rate) based on  reasonably probable assumptions, did not identify any probable  scenarios where the CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below  its carrying amount.

Opus is a leading US-based provider of mortgage  due diligence and risk management services.
The acquisition  will strengthen Wipro’s mortgage solutions and complement  its existing offerings in mortgage origination, servicing and  secondary market.
The acquisition was executed through a share purchase  agreement for a consideration of US$ 75  million including  a deferred earn-out component, which is dependent on  achievement of revenues and earnings over the period of 3  years.
The provisional fair value of the contingent consideration  amounting to ` 7 89, recognized on the acquisition date is  determined by discounting the estimated amount payable to  the previous owners based on achievement of forecast revenue  and EBIT.
The estimated fair value would increase (decrease)  if: (a) the annual growth rate were higher (lower); (b) the EBIT  margin were higher (lower); or (c) the risk adjusted discount rate  were lower (higher).
The following table presents the provisional allocation of  purchase price:  Description   Assets   Cash and cash equivalents  `        22 Property, plant & equipment 65 Trade receivable 458 Other assets 20 Customer related intangibles 236 Software 95 Non-compete arrangement 219 Deferred income taxes, net (133) Liabilities   Other liabilities (258) Total 724 Goodwill 3,095 Total purchase price  ` 3,819 The goodwill of ` 3,095 comprises of value of expected  synergies arising from the acquisition.
Goodwill is not expected  to be deductible for income tax purposes.
None of the trade  receivables have been impaired and it is expected that full  contractual amount can be collected.
From the date of acquisition, Opus has contributed ` 752 of  revenue and ` 79 of profit after taxes for the period of the  Company.
If the acquisition had occurred on April  1, 2013,  management estimates that consolidated revenue for the  Company would have been ` 436,563 and the annual profit after  taxes for the Company would have been ` 78,748.
The pro-forma  amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that would  have occurred if the acquisition had occurred on dates indicated  or that may result in the future.
The purchase consideration has been allocated on a provisional  basis based on management’s estimates.
The Company is in  the process of making a final determination of the fair value of  assets and liabilities, contingent consideration and useful lives of  certain customer-related intangibles.

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and  liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
Fair Value  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,  unbilled revenues, trade payables, current financial liabilities and  borrowings approximate their carrying amount largely due to  the short-term  nature of these instruments.
A substantial portion  of the Company’s long-term debt has been contracted at floating  rates of interest, which are reset at short intervals.
Accordingly,  the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates  fair value.
Further, finance lease receivables are periodically  evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers.
Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for  expected losses on these receivables.
As of March 31, 2013 and  2014, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances  approximates the fair value.
Investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are  classified as available-for-sale are measured using quoted market  prices at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held.
Fair  value of investments in certificate of deposits, classified as  available for sale is determined using observable market inputs.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined  based on observable market inputs including currency spot and  forward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.
Fair value hierarchy  Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level  1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs)  The following table presents fair value hierarchy of assets and  liabilities measured at fair value on  a recurring basis:  Particulars As at March 31, 2013 As at March 31, 2014  Total    Fair value measurements at  reporting date using Total    Fair value measurements at  reporting date using   Level 1  Level 2 Level 3  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Assets                 Derivative instruments                 - Cash flow hedges `  2,590 `  — `  2,590 `  — `  1,289 `  —   `  1,289 `  —   - Net investment hedges —   —   —   —   123 —   123 —   - Others 492 —   492 —   2,535 —   2,425 110 Available for sale financial assets:                 -  Investment in liquid and short-term  mutual funds 14,125 11,811 2,314 —   18,555 16,826 1,729 —   -  Investment in certificate of deposits  and commercial papers 55,046 —   55,046 —   42,002 488 41,514 —   - Investment in equity instruments —   —   —   —   2,676 —   —   2,676 Liabilities                 Derivative instruments                 - Cash flow hedges 65 —   65 —   740 —   740 —   - Net investment hedges 367 —   367 —   718 —   718 —   - Others 661 —   661 —   1,675 —   1,675 —   Contingent consideration —   —   —   —   789 —   —   789 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments included in the  above table:  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 210 Annual Report 2013-14 Derivative instruments (as sets and liabilities): The Company  enters into derivative financial instruments with various  counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment  grade credit ratings.
Derivatives valued using valuation  techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest  rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign  exchange option contracts.
The most frequently applied  valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and  Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value  calculations.
The models incorporate various inputs including  the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot  and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves  of the underlying assets.
As at March 31, 2014, the changes in  counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge  effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge  relationships and other financial instruments recognized at  fair value.
Available for sale investments (Investment in certificate of  deposits and commercial papers): Fair value of available-for-sale  financial assets is derived based on the indicative quotes of price  and yields prevailing in the market as on March 31, 2014.
Available for sale investments (Investment in liquid and short- term mutual funds): Fair valuation is derived based on Net Asset  value published by  the respective mutual fund houses.

Derivatives assets and liabilities:  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency assets / liabilities, forecasted cash flows denominated in  foreign currency and net investment in foreign operations.
The Company follows established risk management policies, including the  use of derivatives to hedge foreign currency assets / liabilities, foreign currency forecasted cash flows and net investment in foreign  operations.
The counter party in these derivative instruments is a bank and the Company considers the risks of non-performance  by the counterparty as non-material.

The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow  hedging reserve as of March 31, 2014 are expected to occur and  reclassified to the statement of income over a period of 5 years.
As at March 31, 2013 and 2014, there were no significant gains  or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof that have  become ineffective as hedges, or associated with an underlying  exposure that did not occur.
Sale of financial assets  From time to time, in the normal course of business, the  Company transfers accounts receivables, net investment in  finance lease receivables (financials assets) to banks.
Under the  terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over  the financial assets and transfer is without recourse.
Accordingly,  such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets.
Gains and  losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded  at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial  assets and fair value of servicing liability.
In certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse.
Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated  to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits  specified in the agreement with the banks.
Financial risk management  General  Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or  to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price  of a financial instrument.
The value of a financial instrument  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 212 Annual Report 2013-14 may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign  currency exchange rates, equity prices and other market changes  that affect market risk sensitive instruments.
Market risk is  attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables  and loans and borrowings.
The Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of  investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating  activities in foreign currency.
The objective of market risk  management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company’s  earnings and equity to losses.
Risk Management Procedures  The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury  department, which evaluates and exercises independent control  over the entire process of market risk management.
The corporate  treasury department recommends risk management objectives  and policies, which are approved by senior management  and the Audit Committee.
The activities of this department  include management of cash resources, implementing hedging  strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies,  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.
Foreign currency risk  The Company operates internationally and a major portion of  the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently  the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through  its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere,  and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign  currencies.
The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign  exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash  flows, pay ables and foreign currency loans and borrowings.
A  significant portion of revenue is in U.S. dollars, euro and pound  sterling, while a significant portion of costs are in Indian rupees.
The exchange rate between the rupee and U.S. dollar, euro and  pound sterling has fluctuated significantly in recent years and  may continue to fluctuate in the future.
Appreciation of the rupee  against these currencies can adversely affect the Company’s  results of operations.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from  these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative  instruments to mitigate such exposure.
The Company follows  established risk management policies, including the use of  derivatives like foreign exchange forward / option contracts to  hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency.
The Company has designated certain derivative instruments  as cash flow hedge to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure  of forecasted highly probable cash flows.
The Company has  also designated a combination of foreign currency borrowings  and related cross-currency swaps and other foreign currency  derivative instruments as hedge of its net investment in foreign  operations.

Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 213 As at March 31, 201 3 and 2014 respectively, every 1% increase/ decrease of the respective foreign currencies compared to  functional currency of the Company would impact our result  from operating activities by approximately ` 116 and ` 593  respectively.
Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing,  including various revolving and other lines of credit.
The  Company’s investments are primarily in short-term investments,  which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk.
The  Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating  to borrowings, by balancing the proportion of fixed rate  borrowing and floating rate borrowing in its total borrowing  portfolio.
To manage this portfolio mix, the Company may enter  into interest rate swap agreements, which allows the Company  to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and  agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates.
As of March 31,  2014, substantially all of the Company borrowings was subject  to floating interest rates, which reset at short intervals.
If interest  rates were to increase by 100 bps from March  31, 2014, net  additional annual interest expense on the Company’s floating  rate borrowing would amount to approximately ` 388.  Credit risk  Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not  be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this,  the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of  customers, taking into account the financial condition, current  economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of  accounts receivable.
Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
No  single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts  receivable as at March  31, 2013 and 2014, respectively and  revenues for the year ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014,  respectively.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired  Cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets,  investment in certificates of deposits and interest bearing  deposits with corporates are neither past due nor impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents with banks and interest-bearing  deposits are placed with corporate, which have high credit- ratings assigned by international and domestic credit-rating  agencies.
Available-for-sale financial assets substantially  include investment in liquid mutual fund units.
Certificates of  deposit represent funds deposited with banks or other financial  institutions for a specified time period.
Financial assets that are past due but not impaired  There is no other class of financial assets that is past due but not  impaired except for trade receivables of ` 3,625 and ` 4,585 as of  March 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Of the total receivables,  ` 52,259 and ` 59,927 as of March 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively,  were neither  past due nor impaired.
The company’s credit period  generally ranges from 45-60 days.
The aging analysis of the  receivables has been considered from the date the invoice falls  due.
The age wise break up of receivables, net of allowances that  are past due, is given below:      As at March 31,  2013   2014   Financial assets that are neither  past due nor impaired `  52,259 `  59,927 Financial assets that are past due  but not impaired     Past due 0 – 30 days 8,047 4,996 Past due 31 – 60 days 4,898 4,646 Past due 61 – 90 days 3,374 3,259 Past due over 90 days 17,229 21,733 Total past due and not impaired `  33,548 `  34,634 Counterparty risk  Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable  securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market  contracts and credit risk on demand and time deposits.
Issuer  risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least  AA rated.
Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of  entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually  banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings.
Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained  within predetermined parameters.
There are limits on credit  exposure to any financial institution.
The limits are regularly  assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including  financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews.
In  addition, net settlement agreements are contracted with  significant counterparties.
Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will  not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a  reasonable price.
The Company’s corporate treasury department  is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement  management.
In addition, processes and policies related to  such risks are overseen by senior management.
Management  monitors the Company’s net liquidity position through rolling  forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.
As of March 31,  2013 and 2014, cash and cash equivalents are held with major  banks and financial institutions.
The table below provides details regarding the remaining  contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at  the reporting date.
The amounts include estimated interest  payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements, if any.

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified  and recorded separately at the time of an acquisition is recorded  by an adjustment to goodwill.
Other than these, the change in  deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the  statement of income.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company  considers the extent to which, it is probable that the deferred  tax asset will be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred  tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable  profits during the periods in which those temporary differences  and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible.
The Company  considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities,  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in  making this assessment.
Based on this, the Company believes  that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of  these deductible differences.
The amount of the deferred tax  asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the  near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the  carry-forward period are reduced.
Deferred tax asset amounting  to ` 1,678 and ` 2,096 as at March 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively  in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognized by  the Company.
The tax loss carry-forwards of ` 5,566 and ` 6,920 as at March  31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, relates to certain subsidiaries  on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the  Company, because there is a lack of reasonable certainty  that these subsidiaries may generate future taxable profits.
Approximately, ` 4,596 and ` 5,869 as at March  31, 2013  and 2014, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is  not currently subject to expiration dates.
The remaining tax  loss carry-forwards of approximately ` 970 and ` 1,051 as at  March 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, expires in various years  through fiscal 2033.
The Company has recognized deferred tax assets of ` 3,526  and `  4,207 in respect of carry forward losses of its various  subsidiaries as at March  31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Management’s projections of future taxable income and tax  planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable  that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilize these  deferred tax assets.
Pursuant to the changes in the Indian income tax laws, Minimum  Alternate Tax (MAT) has been extended to income in respect of  which deduction is claimed under section 10A, 10B and 10AA  of the Act; consequently, the Company has calculated its tax  liability for current domestic taxes after considering MAT.
The  excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal  tax liability can be carried forward and set-off against future tax  liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.
The Company  was required to pay MAT and accordingly, a deferred tax asset  of `  1,844 has been recognized in the statement of financial  position as of March 31, 2013 and 2014, which can be carried  forward for a period of ten years from the year of recognition.
A substantial  portion of the profits of the Company’s India  operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits  attributable to export operations and profits from undertakings  situated in Software Technology, Hardware Technology Parks  and Export Oriented Units.
Under the tax holiday, the taxpayer  can utilize an exemption from income taxes for a period of any  ten consecutive years.
The tax holidays on all facilities under  Software Technology, Hardware Technology Parks and Export  Oriented Units have expired on March 31, 2011.
Additionally,  under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme, units in  designated special economic zones providing service on or  after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent  of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the  first five years from commencement of provision of services  and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years.
Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years  subject to the unit meeting defined conditions.
Profits from  certain other undertakings are also eligible for preferential tax  treatment.
The tax holiday period being currently available to  the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2028.
The  expiration period of tax holiday for each unit within a SEZ is  determined based on the number of years that have lapsed  following year of commencement of production by that unit.
The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current  tax expense from our continuing operations of ` 7,953, ` 9,244  and ` 11,043 for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and  2014 respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts  that we estimate we would have been required to pay if these  incentives had not been available.
The per share effect of these  tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and  2014 was ` 3.25, ` 3.77 and ` 4.50 respectively.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where  the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be  controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will  not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, deferred  income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries  amounting to ` 20,014 and ` 28,959 as of March 31, 2013 and  2014, respectively has not been recognized.
Further, it is not  practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred  tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.
The Company is subject to U.S. tax on income attributable to its  permanent establishment in the United States due to operation  of the U.S. branch.
In addition, the Company is subject to a 15%  branch profit tax in the United States on the “dividend equivalent  amount” as that term is defined under U.S. tax law.
The Company  has not triggered the branch profit tax until year ended March 31,  2014.
The Company intends to maintain the current level of net  assets in the United States commensurate with its operation and  consistent with its business plan.
The Company does not intend  to repatriate out of the Unites States any portion of its current  profits.
Accordingly, the Company did not record current and  deferred tax p rovision for branch profit tax.

Dividends  The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees.
According to the Indian law any dividend should be declared out  of accumulated distributable profits only after the transfer to a  general reserve of a specified percentage of net profit computed  in accordance with current regulations.
The cash dividends paid per equity share were ` 6, ` 6 and  ` 8 during the years ended March  31, 2012, 2013 and 2014,  respectively, including an interim dividend of ` 2 for the years  ended March 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively and ` 3 for the  year ended March 31, 2014.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on April  19, 2014  proposed a final dividend of ` 5 (US$0.08) per equity share and  ADR.
The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at  the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the shareholders, and  if approved, would result in a cash outflow of approximately  ` 14,427, including corporate dividend tax thereon ( ` 2,096).

Additional capital disclosures  The key objective of the Company’s capital management is  to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the  focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer  confidence and to ensure future development of its business.
The  Company focused on keeping strong total equity base to ensure  independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for  potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the  risk profile of the Company.
The Company’s goal is to continue to be able to return excess  liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual  dividends in future periods.
During the year ended March 31,  2013 and 2014, the Company distributed ` 4 and ` 5, respectively  as dividend per equity share.
The Company has also distributed  an interim dividend of ` 3 per equity share during the year ended  March 31, 2014.
The amount of future dividends will be balanced  with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.
The capital structure as of Marc h  31, 2013 and 2014 was as  follows:      As at March 31,    2013 2014 % Change  Total equity attributable  to the equity  shareholders of the  Company ` 283,812 `  343,499 21.03 % As percentage of total  capital 82 % 87 %   Current loans and  borrowings 62,962 40,683   Non-current loans and  borrowings 854 10,909   Total loans and  borrowings 63,816 51,592 (19.16)% As percentage of total  capital 18 % 13 %   Total capital (loans and  borrowings and equity) ` 347,628 ` 395,091 13.65% The Company is predominantly equity-financed.
This is also  evident from the fact that loans and borrowings represented  only 18% and 13% of total capital as of March 31, 2013 and 2014,  respectively.
Further, the Company has consistently been a net  cash company with cash and bank balance along with available  for sale investments being in excess of debt.

Equity shares held by controlled  Wipro Equity Reward Trust (‘WERT’) and Wipro Inc Benefit Trust  (WIBT) have been reduced from the equity shares outstanding  for computing basic and diluted earnings per share.
Earnings  per share and number of shares outstanding for the year ended  March 31, 2012 and 2013, have been adjusted for the grant of  1 employee stock option for every 8.25 employee stock option  held by each eligible employee in terms of the demerger scheme  as on the Re cord Date.

Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 227 30.
Commitments and contingencies  Operating leases: The Company has taken office, residential  facilities and IT equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable  operating lease agreements that are renewable on a periodic  basis at the option of both the lessor and the lessee.
The  operating lease agreements extend up to a maximum of fifteen  years from their respective dates of inception and some of these  lease agreements have price escalation clause.
Rental payments  under such leases were ` 3,457, ` 4,177 and ` 4,583 for the year  ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively in respect  of continuing operations.
Details of contractual payments under non-cancelable leases  are given below:      As at March 31,  2013  2014  Not later than one year `  2,410 `  2,584 Later than one year but not later  than five years 6,147 5,413 Later than five years 3,228 2,881   `  11,785 ` 10,878 Capital commitments:  As at March  31, 2013 and 2014, the  Company had committed to spend approximately ` 1,259 and  ` 778, respectively, under agreements to purchase property and  equipment.
These amounts are net of capital advances paid in  respect of these purchases.
Guarantees:  As at March  31, 2013 and 2014, performance  and financial guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the  Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain  other agencies amount to approximately ` 23,753 and ` 22,864  respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.
Contingencies and lawsuits:  The Company had received tax  demands aggregating to ` 42,883 (including interest of ` 12,907)  arising primarily on account of denial of deduction under section  10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by  the Company’s undertaking in Software Technology Park at  Bangalore and with regard to the method of computing the  tax incentives for exports for the years ended March 31, 2001  to March 31, 2009.
The appeals filed against the said demand  before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of  the Company by the second appellate authority for the years  up to March 31, 2007.
Further appeals have been filed by the  Income tax authorities before the Honorable High Court.
For  the year ended March 31, 2008 and March 2009, the appeal is  pending before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.
In March 2014, the Company received the draft assessment order,  on similar grounds as that of earlier years, with a demand of  ` 9,058 (including interest of ` 2,938) for the financial year ended  March 31, 2010.
Subsequent to the year end the Company has  filed its objections against the said demand before the Dispute  Resolution Panel.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the order  of the appellate authority upholding the claims of the Company  for earlier years, the Company expects that the final outcome of  the above disputes to be in favor of the Company and impact on  the Company’s consolidated financial statement is not expected  to be material.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which  have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
The resolution  of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and  adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial  position of the Company.
The Contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for  excise duty, custom duty, income tax, sales tax and other matters  amounts to ` 2,374, ` 2,273 and ` 2,338 as of March 31, 2012,  2013 and 2014, respectively.
Other commitments: The Company’s Indian operations have  been established as unit in Special Economic Zone and  Software Technology Park Unit under plans formulated by the  Government of India.
As per the plan, the Company’s India  operations have export obligations to the extent of foreign  exchange net positive (i.e.
foreign exchange inflow – foreign  exchange outflow should be positive) over a five year period.
The consequence of not meeting this commitment in the  future would be a retroactive levy of import duties on certain  hardware previously imported duty free.
As of March 31, 2014,  the Company has met all commitments required under the plan.

Segment Information  The Company is organized by business, which primarily includes  IT Services (comprising of IT Services and BPO Services) and IT  Products.
Following the demerger of the Diversified Business and  starting with the quarter ended June 30, 2013, we implemented a  new segment reporting structure to align ourselves with industry  trends.
The industry segments are Banking, Financial Services  and Insurance (BFSI), Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS), Retail,  Consumer, Transport and Government (RCTG), Energy, Natural  Resources and Utilities (ENU), Manufacturing and Hi-tech (MFG),  and Global Media and Telecom (GMT).
The IT Services reportable segment information for the  comparative period by industry class of customers is not restated  to reflect the above change since the meaningful segregation  of the data is impracticable.
However, as required under IFRS 8,  the Company has presented segment information for the current  period on both the old basis and new basis of segmentation.
The Chairman of the Company has been identified as the  Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by IFRS 8– Operating Segments.
The Chairman of the Company evaluates  the segments based on their revenue growth, operating income  and return on capital employed.
The management believes  that return on capital employed is considered appropriate for  evaluating the performance of its operating segments as per old  basis of segmentation.
Return on capital employed is calculated  as operating income divided by the average of the capital  employed at the beginning and at the end of the period.
Capital  employed includes total assets of the respective segments  (except cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments  and inter-corporate deposits amounting to ` 128,037, ` 191,935  and `190,450 as of March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively,  which is included under Reconciling items) less all liabilities,  excluding loans and borrowings.
Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 228 Annual Report 2013-14 Information on reportable segment on the new basis of segmentation for the year ended March 31, 2014 is as follows:      IT Services   BFSI HLS RCTG ENU MFG GMT Total IT Products*  Reconciling Items Entity  total* Revenue  106,035  41,130  58,893  63,923  74,423  55,105  399,509  38,785  (666 )  437,628  Operating income of segment  24,153  7,637  13,012  17,418  17,348  11,569  91,137  310  (1,289 )  90,158  Unallocated              (804 )  —    —    (804 ) Operating income total              90,333  310  (1,289 )  89,354  Finance expense                    (2,891 ) Finance and other income                    14,542  Profit before tax                    101,005  Income tax expense                    (22,600) Profit for the period                    78,405  Depreciation and    amortisation                    11,106  *  The operating income of the IT Products segment and the Company for the year ended March 31, 2014, includes a non-recurring  expense of ` 209, incurred due to cessation of manufacturing of ‘Wipro branded desktops, laptops and servers’ .
Operating income  of the IT Products segment and the Company excluding the above non-recurring expense is ` 519 and ` 89,563 for the year ended  March 31, 2014, respectively, and profit after tax of the Company excluding the above non-recurring expense is ` 78,567 for the  year ended March 31, 2014.

Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 230 Annual Report 2013-14 Note:  The operating income of IT Products segment and the Company  for the year ended March  31, 2014, includes non-recurring  expense of ` 209, respectively, incurred due to cessation of  manufacturing of ‘Wipro branded desktops, laptops and servers’ .
Operating income of the IT Products segment and the Company  excluding the above non-recurring expense is ` 519 and ` 89,563  for the year ended March 31, 2014, respectively and profit after  tax of the Company excluding the above non-recurring expense  is ` 78,567 for the year ended March 31, 2014.
Reconciliation of the reportable segment revenue and profit  before tax:    Y ear ended March 31,  2012  2013  Revenues:     Revenue as per segment reporting ` 375,249 ` 433,608 Less: Foreign exchange (gains) /  losses, net included in segment  revenue (3,278) (2,654) Less: Revenues for discontinued  operations (Note 4) (53,226) (56,706) Inter-group transactions 2 8 Revenues for continuing  operations `  318,747 ` 374,256 Profit before tax:     Profit before tax as per segment  reporting `  69,750 ` 85,045 Less: Profit before tax for  discontinued operations (4,227) (6,449) Profit before tax for continuing  operations `  65,523 ` 78,596 Management believes that it is currently not practicable to  provide disclosure of assets by segment, as they are not identified  to any of the reportable segments and meaningful segregation  of the available information is onerous.
The Company has four geographic segments: India, the United  States, Europe and Rest of the world.
Revenues from the  geographic segments based on domicile of the customer for  continuing operations are as follows:      Y ear ended March 31,  2012 2013 2014 India `  47,058 ` 48,472 46,235 United States 147,151 172,461 200,343 Europe 81,328 99,639 120,868 Rest of the world 46,538 56,310 70,182   ` 322,075 ` 376,882 ` 437,628 No client individually accounted for more than 10% of the  revenues during the year ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
Management beli eves that it is currently not practicable to  provide disclosure of assets by geographical location, as  meaningful segregation of the available information is onerous.
Notes:  a)  The Company has the following reportable segments:   i)  IT Services : The IT Services industry segments are  Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI), Healthcare  and Life Sciences (HLS), Retail, Consumer, Transport and  Government (RCTG), Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities  (ENU), Manufacturing (MFG), and Global Media and Telecom  (GMT).
Key service offering includes software application  development and maintenance, research and development  services for hardware and software design, business application  services, analytics, consulting, infrastructure outsourcing  services and business process outsourcing services.
ii)  IT Products: The Company is a value added reseller  of desktops, servers, notebooks, storage products, networking  solutions and packaged software for leading international  brands.
In certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT Services  segment, the Company delivers hardware, software products  and other related deliverables.
Effective as of the quarter ended  December 31, 2013, the Company ceased the manufacturing of  “Wipro” branded desktops, laptops and servers.
Revenue relating  to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of IT Products.
iii)  ‘Reconciling items’ includes elimination of inter- segment transactions and other corporate activities which do  not qualify as operating segments under IFRS 8.   iv)  In connection with the Demerger of the Diversified  Business (refer to note 4) during the year ended March  31,  2013, the “Consumer Care and Lighting” and “Others” business  segments have been discontinued effective March 31, 2013.  b)  Revenues include excise duty of ` 1,205, ` 1,377 and ` 79  for the year ended March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
For the purpose of segment reporting, the segment revenues are  net of excise duty.

f )  For evaluating the performance of t he individual business  segments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries are reported in  reconciling items.
g)  The Compan y generally offers multi-year payment terms  in certain total outsourcing contracts.
These payment terms  Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 231 primarily relate to IT hardware, software and certain transformation services in outsourcing contracts.
Corporate treasury provides  internal financing to the business units offering multi-year payment terms.
Accordingly, such receivables are reflected in capital  employed in reconciling items.
As of March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, capital employed in reconciling items includes ` 13,562, `  14,123 and ` 15,013 respectively, of such receivables on extended collection terms.
