Open Source Open Source software is changing the way the world  builds software.
This collaborative, iterative, and  transparent development method is powering everything  from reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of natural  disasters like earthquakes to the design of electric cars,  along with countless other projects.
Open Source is  emerging as an important tool as business growth and  bottom-line success.
Enterprises are increasingly looking at Open Source and  Open Stack applications for end-to-end business  collaboration, greater productivity, speed and efficiency.
Open Source applications are also being used to promote  growth for Adaptive Enterprises.
There is a shift from the  conventional application architectures that rely on  individual enterprises to Internet technologies and  services that are more open.
The Next Generation of IT  systems will address the challenges of availability on  scale, moving from efficiency to effectiveness and  erasing the boundaries between personal and enterprise  computing.
T o keep pace with the rapid changes, organizations need  to be nimble.
Also, they need to adopt Open Source that  Annual Report  I  2014-201506 help us to understand our customers better, anticipate  market trends and reinvent the future.
For instance,  Wipro EcoEnergy is using internet-connected sensors to  collect data about energy consumption in retail stores,  applying Big Data analytics to convert this data into  actionable intelligence to reduce energy consumption.
We are also helping clients cross-sell and up-sell through  more effective customer segmentation.
These help our  customers innovate and generate new revenue streams,  optimize key business areas, reduce time and costs, and  and facilitate proactive management.
Big Data Analytics Many of the above mentioned technology areas are at the  forefront of businesses today because of the tremendous  growth in computational and analytical capabilities.
A  four-engine jumbo jet can generate 640 terabytes of data  in just one Atlantic crossing; there are more than 25,000  flights every day, and that gives you a sense of the volume  of data being produced in a single business segment.
A  data explosion has taken place across industries over the  last 15-20 years.
Big Data Analytics has helped analyze  and gain insights into this data to enhance decision  making.
This is a global trend across all industries.
T elecommunications, retail, oil and gas, utilities and  healthcare sectors are all moving towards better  harnessing of data and insights associated with them.

Much of this change is enabled by  innovation in technology and rapid adoption of advanced  technologies or ‘Digital’ technologies.
These Digital  technologies are redefining user experiences and influencing  how we, as individuals and enterprises, live our lives.
Interestingly, many of these innovations happen outside well- funded research laboratories.
Some of the innovations are  outcomes of crowd sourcing where many like-minded persons  come together across locations to create innovative products,  often times in Open Source.
Scalable innovation is also  happening in small startup companies.
At Wipro, we realize the importance of dealing with change.
It is  not sufficient to recognize and react as change happens; it is  important to anticipate and prepare.
T o do this we need to work  both internally and engage with the broader ecosystem.
We do  this in multiple ways.
We invest significantly in reskilling our  Dear Stakeholders,  There is perhaps more certainty in the macro environment  today than there was a couple of years ago.
Global growth has  inched up modestly.
A series of complex macro-economic  forces continue to shape the global economic outlook.
For  example, while the steep drop in oil prices in the middle of the  fiscal year aided consumers and oil-consuming economies, the  oil-producing economies and their supply chain partners in  energy production and exploration were affected adversely.
However, on balance, the outlook for economies which form the  key markets for your company continues to be positive.
Developed economies are expected to fare better in 2015 than  earlier years.
And India is expected to be amongst the fastest  growing economies in 2015.
At the level of the enterprise, there is an acceleration in the rate  Chairman’s letter to the stakeholders       A company can only be as strong as the society it is a part of.

The T rust supports the work of   The Azim Premji Foundation and Azim Premji Philanthropic  Initiative.
Thus, a very significant part of the value created by  Wipro, goes towards social causes.
The Azim Premji Foundation is focused on improving the public  education system in India.
For this purpose, it has done  extensive work in the field, mostly in rural, disadvantaged areas  and also runs a not-for-profit University.
Azim Premji  Philanthropic Initiatives provides institutional and  programmatic grants to not-for-profit, civil society  organizations working in specific areas (e.g.
support to  vulnerable groups, child nutrition).
Our overall work across  education and other areas, is driven by the idea of contributing  to a more just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.
2015 marks the 70th year of the founding of your company.
In  these years, we have continuously strived to enhance  stakeholder value by operating in a sustainable and ethical  manner.
Between the close of fiscal 2014 and 2015, Wipro’s  market capitalization grew by 16%.
Also for the year 2014-15,  dividends declared and proposed will enhance the payout ratio  to 41% from the previous 30%.
In 2015, your company was recognized as a “World’s Most  Ethical Companies®”, for the fourth year in succession, by the  Ethisphere Institute, an independent center of research  promoting best practices in corporate ethics and governance.
Let me conclude by stating that economic value is sustainable  only if created on a foundation of ethics and responsibility.
For  us, this is the driving force in the form of our values and is  something that we will continue to remain completely  committed to.
I thank all of you - customers, employees, suppliers, partners  and shareholders – for your past and continuing support,  engagement and deep commitment.
Very Sincerely, Azim Premji Chairman workforce to take advantage of the newer opportunities that  arise out of Digital technologies.
We invest in partnerships with  companies engaged in niche Digital technologies.
However, even deeper changes face us continually in our  natural environment and society.
Over longer periods of time, it  is these changes that fundamentally drive economic and  business dynamics.
Seven of the top 10 risks identified in the Global Risk Report  released at the World Economic Forum at Davos earlier this  year are either environmental or social risks.
A company can  only be as strong as the society it is a part of.
Thus, it is a  fundamental imperative, not convenience or obligation, that  companies engage deeply and seriously with the big challenges  in these spheres e.g.
water scarcity, climate change, inclusive  education, hunger and nutritional deficit.
Wipro’s engagement with important social and environmental  issues is deliberate and strategic.
Our primary areas of focus  are: Education, Ecology, Primary Health, Disability and  Community Rehabilitation post a natural disaster.
We run a  comprehensive business sustainability program in line with the  T riple Bottom-line framework.
Highlights of our Sustainability  and Social Initiatives can be found in the Business  Responsibility Reporting section of this report.
In addition, we  also publish a detailed Annual Sustainability report.
All seven of  our past reports have been rated A+ based on independent  audits.
Our Social and Sustainability Initiatives are driven by the  conviction that corporations can play a significant role in  contributing to building a better society, and that they must.
However, their very nature and purpose, and the interests of  their stakeholders place limitations on the extent to which they  can go, on these matters.
Even external regulatory mandates to  business corporations, for social action, can have only a limited  role to play.
On the other hand, owners (individuals or other  entities) of such corporations can do a lot more for society,  because they can choose to exercise the right of their  ownership, and invest their wealth in any social cause, to their  utmost.
Over the past fifteen years, I have tried to put this belief into  action through my personal philanthropic work.
Over these  years I have irrevocably transferred a significant part of the  shareholding in Wipro, amounting to 39% of the shares of  Wipro, to a T rust (of which ownership in 21.14% was transferred  and for the balance the T rust is entitled to beneficial interest of  Annual Report  I  2014-2015 11  CEO’s letter to the stakeholders       T echnology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives.

As stakeholders, you are entitled to  know how the Wipro of tomorrow will be perceived differently by  the market and will operate in a dramatically new way.
Last year has been quite eventful for all players in the industry.
On  the surface, it might appear as another year of incremental growth,  but there are clear signs of a generational shift underway-one that  will have signicant implications for all of us in the technology  industry.
T echnology is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives, in  ways that we never envisaged even a decade ago.

T o  enable strategic focus and closer engagement, we have launched a  $100 million corporate venture capital fund that will invest in start- ups with cutting-edge capability.
This fund will operate in concert  with our existing M&A program that aims to ll in any gaps in  market or technology presence.
............................................... Needless to say, any period of business disruption creates a need  for the organization to realign and bring focus back to the single  point that matters in our business- making the customer  successful.
T owards this end, we are making the organization  leaner and empowering our managers to make quicker decisions.
We have launched organization-wide skill development programs  both in new technology domains and also in building capability for  handling new business constructs and execution models.
I am very  happy with the way the organization has risen to the challengeand  feel quite enthused with the positive energy that I see in all my  interactions with associates across geographies and age groups.
I am more certain than ever, that the steps we are taking will  position us well for the future.
We aim to make our customers  successful by being genuine partners, and this will lead to great  outcomes for our employees and shareholders.
Let me close this  note by thanking all our customers, employees, suppliers, partners  and shareholders for their support.
the technology space.
It is important to highlight that while this  trend is an overall positive for the industry, the nature of this spend  is shifting.
In the world of tomorrow, we will see a new buyer in organizations.
With technology acting as a foundation for business, purchase  decisions are being increasingly taken (or at least being  signicantly inuenced) by Chief Marketing Ofcers, Operational  Heads and functional line managers.
These managers are driven  more by aggressive demands on exibility, time-to-market and  transformational potential than by traditional expectations.
This has led to a shift from large internal data centers and large  enterprise applications to cloud-based deployments and business  functionality being made available on a service-based model.
Likewise, leveraging Open Source is becoming increasingly critical  for organizations, both for optimizing on cost and also for  innovation.
Lastly, new paradigms that emphasize customer  experience and experimentation are gaining prominence,  necessitating rapid deployment cycles and closer engagement  between various teams involved from design through to  deployment.
We are approaching a tipping point around this change, and I  suspect most observers and analysts are not fully aware of the  speed at which this change will be upon us.
At Wipro, we are quite  proud of our ability to discern trends and take proactive measures  to shape them to our advantage.
Over the last few decades, we  played a key role in building the outsourcing industry, leading the  drive towards standardized quality models, spearheading remote  infrastructure management and achieving synergies between  T echnology and Process Outsourcing.
Every disruption changes  the playing eld and creates a set of winners who adapt quickly,  leaving behind a set of laggards in their wake.
We have a clear  strategy and a plan of action to back it.
Our strategy is based around two themes – T urbocharge the  Existing Business (Run Strategy) and Dominate the Future  (Change Strategy).
We will ensure that we operate at optimal  efciency in a space that is increasingly undergoing  commoditization.
The resultant savings for the customer will be  directed towards the business transformation agenda.
We believe  these twin themes will allow us to support our customer needs  better and create a sustainable growth engine for ourselves.
Turbocharge the Existing Business:  We continue to    execute on our strategy of focusing on a dened set of accounts  and core markets.
We have launched a simplication initiative to  enhance process velocity and delivery productivity.
This has  yielded good initial results and we plan to drive these measures  across the organization.
We are also investing heavily in  developing automation and Articial Intelligence capabilities.
Through this, we plan to achieve a step-jump in productivity,  quality and reduction in cycle times.

w Business favorable policy decisions of the Government of  India have played a key role in the development of robust  IT and business process management (“BPM”) sectors in  the country.
The Software T echnology Park (“STP”)  Scheme and the Special Economic Zone Act also played a  critical role in the emergence and development of the IT  and BPM industries by providing incentives in the form of  tax holidays.
w India-based IT companies have proven their ability to  deliver premium IT services and business process  management that satisfy the requirements of  international clients who adhere to exacting quality  standards.
According to the NASSCOM report, revenues for fiscal year  2015 for the IT-BPM industry based in India is estimated to be  US$146 billion, which would represent growth of approximately  13% over fiscal year 2014.
According to the NASSCOM Report,  IT export revenues from India, including hardware, are expected  to grow at a year-on-year rate of 12% in fiscal year 2015, driven  by greater demands for social, mobile, analytics and cloud based  solutions.
While exports remain the focus area for the IT  industry in India, the IT services market in India represents  approximately 18% of the total business of India-based IT  services industry and is also expected to be a key growth driver.
According to the NASSCOM Report, the domestic Indian IT- BPM market is expected to have grown by 14%, a growth rate  that is faster than export markets in fiscal year 2015, driven  largely by e-commerce.

1.
Evolving Client Business Models –While overall IT spend  by Enterprises are expected to increase (though  marginally), the IT spend mix on 'Run' part of the business  ('Run' – IT resources consumed and focused on  continuing operation of the business) and ' Change' (IT  resources consumed and focused on developing and  enhancing IT systems in support  of business growth or to  enable the enterprise to enact new business models) part  of the business is shifting.
Investments in ' Change'  programs are on the increase and some are funded  through the efficiency gains from ' Run' business.
The  technology investments are required to be more business  focused and end-user conscious.
Given the pace of  technology transformation, a new set of influencers are  emerging like the Chief Digital Officer and Chief  Marketing Officer.
T oday's Service Providers are required  to address the increasing and diverse needs of the clients.
2.
Changing T echnology Landscape  – IDC predicts that over  65% of Enterprise IT organizations will commit to Hybrid  Cloud technologies before 2016.
This will create a new  set of opportunities as clients look at us to partner with  them on this journey.
Gartner forecasts that the number  of ''Connected Devices'' will be nearly 25 Billion by 2020,  or over three times the number of humans on earth.
This  explosion of connected devices will drive the need for  Data Analytics & Insights services.
3.
Need for newer Models of Service Delivery  – .
Increasingly, enterprises seek integrated solutions &  services – implying the need for service providers to  adopt newer commercial and delivery constructs.
4.
The Digital Opportunity  – Estimated to be an over  $225Billion market by 2020, 80% of incremental  investments of enterprises are expected to be in and  around Digital, driven by need to go 'Digital' to address  the consumer.
A significant portion of such investments  will be funded through legacy spend reductions.
This  has significant implications for service providers  including the need to invest in capabilities such as  Dev/Ops, process & service design, user experience,  architecture & Digital technologies and investing in  creative technologists across a spectrum of Digital  technologies – Internet of Things(IoT), Cloud, Big Data  Analytics & Mobile.

ended March 31, 2014 to 6.37 % for the year ended March 31,  2015.
In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses  increased Rs.
722 million.
This increase is primarily attributable  to an increase in the employee compensation cost due to  increased compensation as part of our annual compensation  review and annual progression cycle and depreciation of Indian  rupee against the U.S. dollar.
General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  from our IT Services segment increased from 5.51% for the year  ended March 31, 2014 to 5.68 % for the year ended March 31,  2015.
In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses  increased Rs.
2,967 million.
This increase is primarily due to an  increase in the employee compensation cost due to increased  compensation as part of our annual compensation review and  annual progression cycle.
The increase is further attributable to  legal and professional expenses by approximately Rs.
985  million  and travel costs by approximately Rs.
789 million.
Segment Results As a result of the above, segment results as a percentage of our  revenue ('margins') from our IT Services segment decreased by  43 bps to 22.18% stay within a narrow range of the segment  margins of 2013-14.
However, in absolute terms, the segment  results of our IT Services segment increased by 8.10%.
Risk Factors  1.
Currency Risk: Our revenues in IT Services are derived in  major currencies of the world while a significant portion  of our costs are in Indian rupees.
The exchange rate  between the rupee and major currencies of the world has  fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue  to fluctuate in the future.
Currency fluctuations can  adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.
2014-15 saw significant volatility in EUR and GBP  thereby causing reported USD revenues to be much  lower than revenues in constant currency, especially in  the latter part of the year.
2.
Competition Risk: The market for IT services is highly  competitive.
Our competitors include software  companies, IT companies, systems consulting and  integration firms, other technology companies and  client in-house information services departments.
We  may also face competition from IT and ITES companies  operating from emerging low cost destination like China,  Philippines, Brazil, Romania, Poland etc.
3.
Global Economic Risk: We derive approximately 50% of  revenues from United States and 29% from Europe.
In an  economic slowdown, our clients located in these  geographies may reduce or defer their technology  spending significantly.
Reduction in spending on IT  services may lower the demand for our services and  negatively affect our revenues and profitability.
4.
Offshore business model risk:  Some countries and  organizations have expressed serious concerns about a  perceived association between offshore outsourcing  and the loss of jobs domestically.
With the growth of  offshore outsourcing receiving increasing political and  media attention, there have been concerted efforts to  enact new legislation to restrict offshore outsourcing or  impose disincentives on companies which have been  outsourcing jobs.
This may adversely impact our ability  to do business in these jurisdictions and could adversely  affect our revenues and operating profitability.
5.
Regulatory changes risk: Our employees who travel to  work onsite at client facilities or at our facilities on  temporary or extended assignments typically must  obtain visas.
Multiple changes to the immigration laws  across geographies are anticipated impacting the  availability of visas and increasing the cycle time  required to obtain the same.
These changes could make  it more difficult for us to obtain visas for our employees,  and hence our ability to compete for and provide  services to our clients in these regions could be impaired.
These risks are broadly country-specific risks.
At an  organizational level, we have a well-defined business  contingency plan and disaster recovery plan to address these  unforeseen events and minimize the impact on services  delivered from our global development centers.
IT Products Industry Overview According to the NASSCOM Report, the hardware segment of the  IT-BPM market in India is estimated to be $13.1 billion in fiscal year  2015 or 27% of the India IT-BPM industry.
The key components of  the hardware industry are servers, desktop, notebook and tablet  computers, storage devices, peripherals, printers and networking  equipment.
Recent trends indicate a rising demand for tablet  computers and weakening demand for desktop computers.
Demand for storage equipment and IT security products has  increased as more data is generated and stored.
While we focus on being a strategic provider of IT services, our  goal is to be the system integrator of choice and so we  provide  IT products as a complement to our IT services offerings.
In the  India and Middle East markets, we are a leading provider of  Annual Report  I  2014-201532 system integration services, where we provide a full suite of IT  services as well as complementary hardware solutions and  software licenses.
Revenue from the hardware products and  software licenses sold is recorded under the IT Products  segment.
We have diverse range of clients across all major  industries, primarily in the India and Middle East market.
Effective as of the quarter ended December 31, 2013, we ceased  manufacturing “Wipro” branded desktops, laptops and servers.
We will continue to fill existing orders and honor our warranty  and service obligations.
We will continue to maintain a presence  in the hardware market by providing suitable third-party brands  as a part of our solutions in large integrated deals.
Our IT Products segment accounted for 8.9% and 7.2%of our  revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015,  respectively and 0.3% and 0.4% of our operating income for each  of the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
In order to offer comprehensive IT system integration solutions  we use a combination of hardware products (including servers,  computing, storage, networking, security) and related software  products, (including databases and operating systems) and  integration services.

Please see Note 31 of the ‘Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS' for additional details.
Revenue Our revenue from the IT Products segment decreased by 12.32%, primarily due to decrease in revenue from domestic sales of  computers and servers following cessation of manufacturing “Wipro” branded desktops, laptops and servers as of December 31, 2013.
Profitability Our gross profit for the year ended  March 31, 2015 as a percentage of our IT Products segment revenue increased by 9 bps over the year  ended March 31, 2014.
One must note that during the year ended March 31, 2014, the segment incurred a non-recurring expense due to  the cessation of manufacturing “Wipro” branded desktop, laptops and servers.
Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from our IT Products segment increased marginally from 3.44% for the year  ended March 31, 2014 to 3.76% for the year ended March 31, 2015.

General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from our IT Products segment decreased from 3.82% for the year  ended March 31, 2014 to 3.29% for the year ended March 31, 2015.
In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses decreased by  Rs.362 million primarily on account of optimization initiatives.
As a result of the above, in absolute terms, segment results of our IT Products segment increased by 20.65%.
Risk IT Products revenues are impacted by seasonal changes that affect purchasing patterns among our clients for hardware products,  (including servers, computing, storage, networking, security) and software products, (including databases and operating systems) The IT products market is a dynamic and highly competitive market.
In the marketplace, we compete with both international and local  providers.
Our local competition comes from HCL and TCS, among others.
Our international competitors include IBM, Dell and HP.
One of the major challenges we encounter is margin pressure due to competitive pricing.
Achieving mindshare and market share in a  crowded market place requires differentiated strategies on pricing, branding, delivery and products design.
We believe we are favorably  positioned based on our brand, quality leadership, expertise in target markets and our ability to create customer loyalty by delivering  value to our customers.
Discussion on Consolidated Financials (1) For the purpose of segment reporting, we have included the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in revenue.
Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations,  revenue, as reported in our statements of income, is Rs.
434,269 million and Rs.
469,545 million for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.

This was driven primarily by a  10.2% increase in revenue from our IT Services segment and  offset partially by a 12.3% decrease in revenue from our IT  Products segment.
The increase in IT Services revenues was  driven by growth in our Healthcare and Life Sciences industry  vertical, Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities industry vertical  and Global Media and T elecom industry vertical, as well as  depreciation of INR against USD.
Profitability In absolute terms, cost of revenues increased by 8.73%  primarily on account of increases in employee compensation  due to rupee depreciation, salary increases, stock compensation  awarded and increases in headcount during the year, and  increase in subcontracting /technical fees/third party  application fee.
As a result of the foregoing factors, our gross profit as  percentage of our total revenue from continuing operations  decreased by 38 basis points (bps).
Selling and Marketing Expenses Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total  revenue decreased from 6.68% for the year ended March 31,  2014 to 6.47% for the year ended March 31, 2015.
In absolute  terms, selling and marketing expenses increased by 4.71%,  primarily due to increases in travel expenses and depreciation,  amortization and impairment charges.
General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of  revenue increased minimally from 5.38% for the year ended  March 31, 2014 to 5.46% for the year ended March 31, 2015.
In  absolute terms, general and administrative expenses increased  by 9.82%, primarily due to increases in employee  compensation, legal and professional fees and travel expenses.
Results from Operations As a result of the foregoing factors, our results from operating  activities (operating margin) as a percentage of revenue has  decreased by 25 bps from 20.42% to 20.17%.
However, our  operating income increased by 6.79%, from Rs.
89,354 million   for the year ended March 31, 2014 to Rs.
95,423 million for the  year ended March 31, 2015.
Finance Expenses Our finance expenses increased from Rs.
2,891 million for the  year ended March 31, 2014 to Rs.
3,599 million for the year  ended March 31, 2015.
This increase is primarily due to increase  of Rs.
808 million in exchange loss on foreign currency  borrowings and related derivative instruments.
This increase  has been partially offset by a decrease in interest expense by  Rs.100 million during the year ended March 31, 2015.
Finance and Other Income Our finance and other income increased from Rs.
14,542 million  for the year ended March 31, 2014 to Rs.
19,859 million for the  year ended March 31, 2015.
This increase was due to an increase  in cash available for investments due to enhanced cash flows.
Additionally, gain on sale of investments increased by Rs.
2,251  million and interest and dividend income increased by Rs.
3,066  million during the year ended March 31, 2015 as compared to the  year ended March 31, 2014.

Our effective tax rate decreased  from 22.4% for the year ended March 31, 2014 to 22.0% for the  year ended March 31, 2015.
This decrease is primarily due to  write-backs during the year subsequent to completion of  assessments.
As a result of the foregoing factors, our profit attributable to  equity holders increased by Rs.
8,561 million or 11%, from Rs.
77,967 million for the year ended March 31, 2014 to Rs.
86,528  million for the year ended March 31, 2015.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy and Results We have a consistent hedging policy, designed to minimize the  impact of volatility in foreign exchange fluctuations on the  earnings and assets & liabilities.
We evaluate exchange rate  exposure arising from transactions and positions and enter into  foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such  exposure.
We follow established risk management policies,  including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward /  option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in  foreign currency.
As per the policy, the total hedges shall be 50%  to 100% of the next four quarters of inflows in addition to select  long term contracts which are beyond one year in tenor.
Our net  foreign exchange gains/ (losses) from continuing operations for  the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015 were Rs.
3,359 million  and Rs.
3,637 million respectively.

Cash from Operating Activities Cash generated by operating activities for the year ended March  31, 2015 increased by Rs.
10,365 million, while profit for the year  increased by Rs.
8,654 million during the same period.
The  increase in cash generated by operating activities is primarily  due to improved working capital management.

8,523 million as against Rs.
34,972 million for the  year ended March 31, 2014.
This increase is primarily due to an  increase in net proceeds of loans and borrowings amounting to  Rs.
31,649 million partly offset by increase in payment of  dividend amounting to Rs.
6,217 million.
Dividend: On April 21 2015, our Board proposed a final cash  dividend of Rs.
7 (US$0.11) per equity share and ADR.
The  proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at the next  Annual General Meeting, and if approved, would result in a cash  outflow of approximately Rs.
20,739 million, including corporate  dividend tax thereon.
This is in addition to the interim dividend  of Rs 5 ($0.08) per equity share and ADR declared  in January  2015.
After maintaining a steady dividend payout ratio of 30%,  33% and 31% for the years 2013-14, 2012-13 and 2011-12, we  have, considering the needs of liquidity and strategic  requirements, enhanced the dividend payout ratio in 2014-15 to  41% We maintain a debt level that we have established through  consideration of a number of factors including cash flow  expectations, cash required for operations and investment  plans.
We continually monitor our funding requirements, and   maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources,  as needed.
Please refer to Note 13 of our ‘Consolidated Financial  Statements under IFRS' for additional details on our borrowings.
Cash generated from operations is our primary source of  liquidity.
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents along  with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet  our working capital requirements as well as repayment  obligations with respect to debt and borrowings.
As of March 31, 2015, we had contractual commitments of Rs.
1,262 million related to capital expenditures on construction or  expansion of software development facilities, Rs.

20,007 million related to other purchase obligations.
Plans to  construct  development facilities are based on business  requirements.
In relation to our acquisitions, a portion of the purchase  consideration is payable upon achievement of specified  earnings targets in the future.
We expect that our cash and cash  equivalents, investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds  and the cash flows expected to be generated from our  operations in the future will generally be sufficient to fund the  earn-out payments and our expansion plans.
In the normal course of business, we transfer accounts  receivables, net investment in sale-type finance receivable  (financial assets).
The incremental impact of such transactions  on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31,   2014 and 2015 is not material.
Please refer Note 16 of our  ‘Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS' for additional  details.
Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected by many  factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing  operations of our businesses and some of which arise from  uncertainties related to global economies and the markets that  we target for our services.
We cannot be certain that additional  financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.
As of March 31, 2014 and 2015, our cash and cash equivalents  were primarily held in Indian Rupees, U.S.

In 2001 we added our first organized  community initiatives (Wipro Cares) followed by a program on  school education in 2002 (Wipro Applying Thought in Schools).
We started working methodically on Ecology & Environment in  2008.
In 2014, under the overarching umbrella of Education, we  added a significant new initiative on ‘Children with Disability’ .
This program, at a conceptual level, is an extension of our long  running and successful program for ‘Persons with Disability’  within Wipro.
This compelling imperative of boundary-less  thinking is a fundamental driving principle of all our programs.
We run all our social programs on a strong foundation of ethical  principles, good governance and sound management.
Our ‘Good  Citizen’ manifesto articulates a set of guiding principles that  inform our thinking and actions.
The manifesto covers a wide  range – a foundation of values as embedded in Spirit of Wipro,  compliance with laws and regulations, a robust framework of  corporate governance, proactive and strategic engagement  with key challenges of the environment and society, serving our  multiple stakeholders and working with proximate communities,  all in a manner that is thoughtful, deliberative and systemic.
The salient highlights of our initiatives for 2014-15 are articulated  below.
You will also find in this report a detailed summary of  our sustainability initiatives under the ‘Business Responsibility  Reporting’ section.
It must be emphasized that our sustainability  and social programs are wide ranging and global in scope.
For  a fuller understanding of these, you may want to refer to our  comprehensive annual sustainability reports based on GRI  principles.
These and various other details are available at the  websites, www.wipro.com and www.wipro,org  A.
Education  Our work in education is based on the guiding principles  that (a) It must contribute to systemic or institutional  improvement in education and / or (b) It should address the  needs of underserved and underprivileged sections and (c)  In all cases, the work must be deep and meaningful.
Our  programs span school and college education across India as  well as in the U.S. and address the themes of ‘Organizational  Capability Building’ , ‘Good Quality Educational Material’  , ‘Advocacy’ and ‘Sustainability in Education’ .
A.1 Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS) is a social  initiative working on building capacity in school education  reform in India.
Over the past 14 years, WATIS has worked  closely with 35 organizations working in improvement of  school education.
Our work, spread over 67 educational  projects, has involved over 2300 schools and 13,250  educators across 17 states reaching out to about 1 million  students.
A point to emphasize here is that the indirect  impact of our work is manifold the above numbers.
During 2014-15, six new partners were added in Assam,  Koppal in Karnataka, Hyderabad, Kerala and Mumbai.
Their work include improving the quality of education in  government schools, strengthening social science and  ecology education in schools and supporting education  of children from marginalized communities  A.2 Complementing the systemic engagements of WATIS  is the work of our trust, Wipro Cares that supports in a  more direct way, access to educational opportunities for  underprivileged and marginalized children.
For example,  our partner of many years in Pune, Door Steps Schools  runs mobile units that provides schooling to children of  migrant laborers working in construction sites in a city.
The  ten projects run by Wipro Cares in the cities of Bangalore,  Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai benefits  more than 50000 children.
A.3 During the year, we started a significant new initiative  for ‘Children with Disability’ .
In the first year, our programs  supported the educational and rehabilitative needs of  1350 underprivileged children with disability through  five projects in the cities of Bangalore, Pune, Jaipur and  Hyderabad.
Our focus is on early intervention and inclusive  education: the first element is crucial in the battle against  disability as early actions help prevent many subsequent  complications; the second element underpins the principle  that children with disability must grow in a school  environment that empowers them by helping integrate  with the mainstream.
A.4 We started a significant program in school education  in 2013 in the U.S.A.
While the expenditure associated with  this may not be allowable as CSR as per the Companies  Act 2013, this is an integral part of our global CSR strategy  and therefore something that merits disclosure.
The  program is currently running in Chicago, New Jersey,  New York and Boston.
We are partnering with University  of Massachusetts, Boston and Michigan State University.
Mercy College in New York and Montclair State University  in New Jersey are also involved.
The program works in close  collaboration in over 20 school districts wherein 250-350  teachers go through a 2-3 year fellowship with intense  support to develop their capacities to be better teachers  and change leaders.
The district administrators are a part  of the program.
We intend to expand these programs to  other cities in future.
The current commitment of Wipro  to these programs is about 7.8 million USD over a period  of 5 years.
This is a large and substantial commitment to  improving science and math in school education, one of  the largest such commitments made by a non US company.
A.5 earthian is a program that brings together two of our  key concerns: Education and Sustainability.
It comprises an  annual cycle where schools and colleges across the country  participate in an enriching learning program; selected  institutions then become part of a three year Continuing  Engagement Program.
In 2014-15, the program had an  outreach to 9000 institutions.
550 schools and colleges  submitted entries with 23 selected winners.

A.6 Developing workplace relevant engineering and  technology skills that is also up-to-date and relevant is  critical for a country like India where the IT Services industry  contributes to nearly 8% of the GDP .
Our efforts in this  direction go back several years and address two important  dimensions: (a) Skills development for students that is  based on a comprehensive framework of post-graduate  level education and (b) Capacity building among the  faculty of engineering colleges.
The Wipro Academy of Software Excellence (WASE)  program that helps Science graduates to study for a  Masters degree in Software Engineering (M.Tech).
Run in  partnership with the Birla Institute of Technology & Science  (BITS), Pilani, India, this unique program blends rigorous  academic exposure with practical professional learning  at the workplace, We run a similar program called WISTA  in collaboration with Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)  for science graduates without a mathematics background.
Since its inception in 1995, Wipro has supported and  enabled nearly 50000 students to graduate from the  WASE and WISTA programs with an MS degree in Software  Engineering.
During 2014-15, the total number of new  entrants into the two programs was 1710 while the  aggregate strength across four years was 12850.
Mission10X started in 2007 has the goal of improving  education in India’s engineering colleges.
Over the last six  years Mission10X has reached out to over 26,313 faculty  members across 1300+ engineering colleges in 27 states.
The work involves faculty capacity development, and  curricular improvement.
The initiative has also catalyzed  a group of 20 organizations working on the same space.
It  has also created a substantial on-line resource base which  is expanding B.
Primary Health Care and Communities  B.1 Along with education, access to primary health care is  a key determinant of an individual’s future trajectory in life,  including the ability to engage in productive livelihoods  and responsible citizenship, In India, nearly 600 million  people do not have access to basic health care which is  affordable and of good quality.
At Wipro, our approach in  this regard is to focus on the health needs of our proximate  communities around the major centers of our operations.
We run these programs through Wipro Cares, our public  trust.
Wipro Cares works with partners who oversee the delivery  of good quality primary health care services to underserved  communities covering more than 75000 people in 53  villages across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh &  Uttarakhand.
We follow an integrated approach that along  with the delivery of regular health services, lays emphasis  on building the capacity of the communities in developing  a higher degree of self-reliance to handle their own primary  health care needs.
B.2 Disadvantaged communities face several challenges  and one that visits them at regular frequency in our  country is natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and  cyclonic storms.
The already fragile basis of their livelihoods  gets further disrupted in the wake of a natural disaster.
Since 2002,we have responded in both monetary terms  and in-kind to several natural calamities wherein Wipro’s  employees have also risen to the occasion and played  a sterling role.
By design, we focus on the more difficult  challenge of long term rehabilitation of the affected  communities.
During 2014, we initiated two disaster rehabilitation  projects in Uttarakhand and Odisha in response to the  floods and cyclone events in 2013.
In line with our approach,  both these projects focus on long term rehabilitation and  strengthening of the affected communities.
In Uttarakhand,  in collaboration with very credible local partners with a  long track record, multiple activities on strengthening  local livelihoods were initiated.
20 village level farmer’s  group have been formed with the objective of training  them on alternate methods of farming.8964 fruit saplings  have been planted in farms belonging to 293 farmers  while 236 beneficiaries have been identified for vegetable  plantation.
Our work in Odisha touched the lives of 250  farmers and their families who were provided fishing nets  and awareness training around them, Village level Disaster  Committees were set up in 15 villages.
C. Ecology & Environment  Ecological sustainability is one of the defining challenges  facing humanity in the 21st century.
How we manage  the issues of climate change, water scarcity, biodiversity  loss and pollution will determine the trajectory of our  development.
Wipro’s engagement with these issues goes  back several years and is based on the dual approach of  (a) continually improving the energy, water, waste and  biodiversity footprint of our business operations and  (b) engaging on community-level actions and advocacy  on these issues.
We present below some interesting  illustrations of our work  C.1 We initiated the “Participative Community Water  Program” in the Sarjapur area in Bangalore which is  completely dependent on groundwater.
The initiative  seeks to involve proximate communities in a unique  citizen-led governance model of groundwater.
The  year saw the successful completion of the first phase of  developing a detailed groundwater aquifer map for a  33 sq km area around our Sarjapur campus.
The aquifer  map along with a citizen portal will help inform collective  decision making on groundwater management in a more  scientific manner 01 Directors Report_2015.indd   67 6/21/2015   4:09:42 PM 68 Annual Report 2014-15  C.2.
Our urban biodiversity program addresses the twin  goals of creating biodiversity in our urban campuses  while also using it as a platform for wider education and  advocacy, Our first project of a unique Butterfly Park in  the Electronic City campus in Bangalore was initiated two  years back and completed in early 2014.
In 2014-15 we  progressed as per plan on the next phase of an innovatively  conceived wetland biodiversity zone that will use recycled  water.
In our Pune campus, the first phase has been  completed with a tripling of the number of native species  from 59 to 167.
Both these projects will serve a larger  purpose of education on biodiversity and the plan going  forward is to link it with our earthian program for schools  on sustainability education.
C.3 Rapid development of renewable energy (RE) solutions  is a crucial element in combating climate change.
India has  put together a clear road map of adding RE capacity over  the next 10 years.
Business can play an important role in  both, the production ecosystem and through conscious  choices in purchasing RE in its own operations.
At Wipro,  renewable energy accounts for more than 20% of the  electricity footprint and in 2014-15, we procured 66 Million  units of RE translating into 52000 metric tons of greenhouse  gas emissions avoided.
C.4 Effective and efficient management of urban solid  waste is a pressing problem in all our cities.
While the  use of right technology, good governance and the active  participation of civil society are important determinants  of success, the work of the informal sector is often  unrecognized.
We initiated a project in Bangalore that will  provide skills upgrading to 260 workers in the informal  sector of waste along with access to better nutrition, safety  gear and health insurance.
C.5 We have been supporting a program in social forestry  in rural Tamil Nadu near Chennai for the past four years.
The program works towards the twin goals of afforestation  and improved livelihood options.
More than 80 farmers are  the beneficiaries of the income that will accrue from the  produce of more than a hundred thousand trees that have  been planted.
D. The power of engaged employees  Employees are integral to many of our social programs.
The Wipro Cares trust is built on a model of employee  contribution that is matched by Wipro.
Nearly one in three  employees or more than 48,000 Wiproites are contributors  to Wipro Cares making this possibly the largest such  initiative in India and one of the largest in the world.
During  2014-15, nearly 1600 employees also engaged with more  than 3600 hours of volunteer work, Employees have also  keen participants in other significant initiatives including  those on campus biodiversity and improving public  transportation services.
In conclusion, we recognize that this is a journey where  one learns all the time.
While on the matter of ethics and  values, we will hold ourselves up to the highest standards,  on matters of governance and management of our  CSR programs, we recognize that there could be many  opportunities for improvement.
We will continually self- reflect, act, and review all the time.

833 02 Corporate Governance_2015.indd   105 6/21/2015   4:12:03 PM 106 Annual Report 2014-15 Introductory Context  Our fourth Business Responsibility Report (BRR) published  along with the Annual Financial Report provides an overview of  Wipro’s sustainability program for the year 2014-15.
This report  is a summary of our sustainability program and must be read in  conjunction with our more detailed sustainability report which  is published separately every year.
Our Sustainability reporting was based on the GRI 3.1 framework  till 2013-14 and externally assessed at application level “A” for the  last seven years.
We are transitioning to GRI 4 framework from  the 2014-15 reporting year.
In preparing this overview, while drawing from our GRI reporting  experience, we have largely aligned it with the ‘National  Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs) on the Social, Environmental and  Economic responsibilities of Business” released by the Ministry  of Corporate Affairs in 2011.
•	 For	details 	of	the	NVGs, 	please 	refer 	http://ww w. mca.gov.in/Ministry/latestnews/National_Voluntary_ Guidelines_2011_12jul2011.pdf •	 Our	Sustainability	Reports	can	be	viewed	and	downloaded	 at	http://www.wipro.com/about-Wipro/sustainability/ Materiality & Scope The scope of this report covers all of Wipro Ltd. ’s business - unless  mentioned otherwise - and is for the financial year 2014-15.
The content for this section is driven by the twin pillars of  Stakeholder Inclusiveness  and Materiality Determination  i.e.
‘Who are our stakeholders?’ and ‘What issues are material to  them?’ The stakeholders, identification of nineteen material  aspects and their relative position in terms of relevance to Wipro  and	stakeholders	is	available	at	http://wiprosustainabilit yreport.
com/materiality-determination.
The principal sustainability topics covered in this report are  structured as shown in the table for clarity of understanding,  the corresponding NVG principle against each topic is  mentioned.
Further disclosures pursuant to Clause 55 of the Listing  Agreement are provided on our website at  www.wipro.com Sustainability Dimension Sustainability Dimension NVG Principle(s) Stakeholder Engagement 4 Corporate Governance 1 Workplace Sustainability  3, 5 and 4 Ecological Sustainability 6 Value Chain Sustainability 2 and 9 Education & Community 8 Advocacy & Outreach 7 As the larger sustainability context has changed and progressed  significantly over the last six years – stakeholders’ perceptions and  expectations have changed and assessments of sustainability  risks and opportunities have transformed.
Further, our  sustainability program has matured, which has helped us in  developing a deeper understanding of various aspects and  issues, and more clarity on the changes we could make in  our approach.
Therefore, in early 2014, we began the process  of reviewing our materiality framework and changing it as  strategically appropriate.
The materiality revision process is  ongoing and expansive, and takes a fresh look at the material  dimensions and recalibrate them afresh, without assumptions  or pre-determined notions.
As part of this process we are  engaging with multiple stakeholders, separately as well as  collectively, so as to get individual and group perspectives.
Stakeholder Engagement Management Approach: Defining who an organization’s primary stakeholders  are can be relatively straightforward within the business  ecosystem but complex when it comes to the larger social  and environmental contexts.
BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   106 6/21/2015   4:09:09 PM Wipro Limited 107 Our stakeholder group is comprehensive, and we seek to  engage with them on important social and ecological issues.
Our eight identified stakeholders are •	 Employees •	 Customers •	 Investors •	 Suppliers •	 The	Education 	ecosyst em:	Partners 	and	Academic 	 Institutes •	 Communities	and	Civil	Society	Networks •	 Government	and	Policy	Networks •	 The	Young	Citiz en	and	Futur e	Gener ations At Wipro, we have always viewed our Customers, Employees  and Investors as strategic partners and stakeholders.
While  the IT services industry model does not necessitate a deep  supply chain, the rapid expansion of this sector in the last two  decades has resulted in a variety of ancillary services e.g.
bus  transport, housekeeping, canteen, security.
Services Suppliers  and Contractors have thus become critical stakeholders for our  operations.
These support or ancillary services are especially  vulnerable to human rights and labour practices violations  due	to	socio-ec onomic	conditions/backgr ound.
Over	the	last	 decade, our programs in education and community care have  brought us in close engagement with two new stakeholders  –	Partners 	in	the	Education 	Ecosy stem	and	Pro ximate	 Communities.
Wipro engages closely with Government on  policy advocacy, both through industry networks as well as  directly.
The principal areas of engagement relate to energy,  water, e-waste, education policy and the recent CSR rules under  the Companies Bill 2012.
We think that the future must inform our thinking and actions  on sustainability more than anything else, as otherwise our  vision will stop short of being truly sustainable; therefore,  our	eighth	stakeholder 	is	‘the	Young	Citizen	and	Future	 Generations’ .
This stakeholder group captures the centrality  of our planetary actions to the lives of the current generation  of children and young adult who will have to live through and  negotiate any adverse environmental impacts in a few decades  from now.
While this group may not have a tangible and real  face to it, we try to use them as an anchoring guide for our  thinking and actions.
The summary representation of our eight stakeholders, the  modes and frequency of our engagement with them and the  major issues of engagement that have emerged over a period  of	time	are	disclosed	in	our	2013-14	Sustainability	Report .
http:// www.wiprosustainabilityreport.com/summary-stakeholder- engagement Corporate Governance Management Approach: An organization’s economic and social license to operate  depends on the soundness of its governance and management  practices.
The visual below showing the organizational  architecture of Wipro illustrates this point – most of the  boxes reflect a long-term orientation that a company needs  to assiduously build and ingrain into its DNA.
Sustainability Governance The centrality of Sustainability to Wipro’s vision and outlook is  reflected in the commitment and engagement with sustainability  issues by Wipro’s leadership team, starting with our Chairman.
The board is also involved in the oversight of our sustainability  & CSR initiatives and the Board Governance, Nomination &  Compensation Committee headed by an independent director  is the apex body that oversees our policy and programs.
Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) who is part of the  Corporate Executive Council, the senior most executive body  in the organization carries overarching responsibility for our  sustainability charter and reports to the chairman and the  Committee.
The strength of our sustainability governance is also  derived from the fact that multiple functions see themselves  as key stakeholders in its success; among these, the Global  Operations	team,	the	People	Function,	the	Inv estor	Relations	 team and the Legal team play a major role in several of the  programs.
The sustainability program is reviewed on a quarterly  basis by the Chairman and the Corporate Executive Council.

The COBC is applicable to all business  practices and employees, contractor employees and consultants  and it covers critical aspects like customer relations; protecting  customer information; supplier selection; conflicts of interest;  gifts, entertainment & business courtesies; communicating  with the public; confidential information; intellectual property,  competitive/business	intelligenc e,	protec ting	the	privac y	of	 employee and personal information; business records and  internal controls; safeguarding company assets; insider trading;  anti-trust and fair competition; anti-corruption; political  involvement/lobbying;	global	trade;	human	rights;	diversity	and	 non-discrimination; harassment-free workplace; safe and healthy  work environment; and sustainability and corporate citizenship.
We have a zero tolerance policy for noncompliance with the non- negotiable aspects of COBC e.g.
child labor, anti-corruption etc.
The	code	can	be	accessed	at	http://ww w.wipro.com/Documents/ investors/pdf-files/code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics.pdf.
The COBC is socialized at multiple points of an employee’s  lifecycle - it is first covered as part of the induction program  of new hires and subsequently, every employee has to take an  online test annually to assert their familiarity with the tenets  of the COBC.
Having a robust whistleblower policy that employees and other  stakeholders can use without fear or apprehension is a sine non  qua for a transparent and ethical company.
Wipro’s Ombuds- process allows and encourages any affected stakeholder to  report breaches of the COBC and any other matter of integrity  to the concerned Ombuds-person.
In conjunction with the  Prevention	of	Sexual	Harassment	policy,	the	Ombuds	process	 provides a strong framework of assurance and protection to all  our stakeholders through 24x7 access to the online portal and  helpline number..
In Wipro, our Chief Ombuds-person works with designated  Ombuds-persons in each Business Unit.
The process ensures  confidential and anonymous submissions regarding (i)  questionable accounting or auditing matters, the conduct  of which results in a violation of law by Wipro (ii) substantial  mismanagement of company resources (iii) Any instance of  sexual harassment or any other form of discrimination (iv) Any  violation of human rights as articulated in the COBC and as per  the principles of the U. N. Global Compact.
In 2014-15, a total  of 1093 complaints were received via the Ombuds process and  the action taken cases as of March 2015 was 88%.
Based on  self-disclosure data, 60% of these were from employees and the  balance were mainly anonymous and from other stakeholderlike  vendors and customers.
A total of 100 complaints of sexual  harassment was raised through Ombuds, of which 92 cases were  substantiated and appropriate actions were taken in all cases.

Employee Engagement & Empowerment Wipro has continually sought to implement practices to enhance  the engagement, capability and competitiveness of our talented,  global workforce.
These practices are aligned to different phases  of hiring, assimilation, learning, growth and retention and  shaped by the Spirit of Wipro values.
The Spirit of Wipro values  weave the thread that ties all Wiproites together and also shapes  leadership behavior.
Employees’ feedback on the Spirit of Wipro  values	is	a	key	component	in	our	Employee	Perc eption	Survey	 as well as in our Wipro Leaders’ Qualities 360-degree feedback  process.
While the Spirit of Wipro defines the core values of the  organization,	the	Wipro	Tenets	were	launched	in	FY	2013-14	 to explain the value system in action.
Advocacy of the tenets  continued to be the focus in 2014-15 through CEO and business  leaders’ communication, Tenet evangelist workshops and Tenet  immersion sessions.
Over the years, our focus on participative engagement has  increased and our programs have been more closely aligned to  cater to our diverse and multi-generational workforce.
Employee  feedback has led to the review of and changes in legacy  initiatives like the Unified Competency Framework (UCF) to make  it more relevant to the needs of the current and future workforce.
The erstwhile UCF certification is currently being revamped.
Through mailers, awareness sessions and announcements on the  intranet	and	forums	such	as	Yammer,	these	changes	are	being	 communicated to employees.
Our employee engagement programs are driven at multiple  levels	–	organizational, 	unit/team	and	individual 	and	also	 includes retainers and contractors on projects.
Besides our  awareness campaigns like email announcements, kiosks and  on-floor sessions, business and HR managers are key enablers to  employee engagement.
Defined metrics on connects like ‘Wipro  Meets’ , ‘All Hands Meet’ , one-to-one and team meetings are  embedded in the key performance areas of leaders and HR alike.
Employee Feedback Wipro is committed to engaging in direct and open  communication with all our employees.
Through multiple  formal and informal channels, employee feedback is solicited  throughout the year and actions initiated at micro and macro  levels.
People	metrics	form	a	key	parameter 	in	assessing 	 performance of leaders and HR practitioners and are tracked  and reviewed regularly.

Over 57,000 Wiproites are currently  Yammer	users	and	over	4700	public	and	priva te	groups	have	 been	formed.
Through	activities	like	cont ests,	‘YamJam ’	sessions,	 recognitions,	leadership	updates	and	special	inter est/functional	 groups,	use	of	Yammer	has	led	to	increased	networ king	and	 collaboration amongst employees separated by businesses and  geographies.
Yammer	has	also	enabled	employees	to	provide	 real-time feedback through online polls and ask queries directly  to	leaders	/	functional	teams.
Employee Advocacy Group (EAG)  The Employee Advocacy Group (EAG) is a 120 member  representative group managed by Wiproites to voice employee  suggestions.
EAG Members aim to pool employee ideas and  provide recommendations to improve company policies and  processes.

Ecological Sustainability Management Approach: Ecological sustainability is a cornerstone of our charter and  a major driver of our key programs.
Our approach is built on  the pillars of Energy and GHG mitigation, Water efficiency  and	Responsible	Wat er	man agement,	Pol lution	and	Was te	 management,	Biodiversity	and	Product	Stewardship.
The increasing centrality of issues like climate change and  water stress in the last few years has led organizations to  look beyond their boundaries.
While internal business drivers  like  resource efficiency, waste management and  pollution  mitigation have been the primary levers of any corporate   environmental program for many now, organizations have  come to realize that in order to make a real impact at a larger,  systemic level, one can no longer ignore the externalized  costs of ecological damage.
The responsible water program  and community programs on waste are two examples of  such programs.
Scope of Reporting India:	All	55	locations,	the	majority	of	operations	are	from	26	 owned locations representing 88% of our workforce.
As part of  the consolidation exercise, we have moved out from 8 leased to  existing owned locations in the reporting year.
Overseas:		83	locations,	which	includes	8	customer	data	cent ers.
Nearly all of the office locations overseas are leased.
Management system Our programs and management systems are pivoted and derived  from the Ecological Sustainability Commitment, available at  http://wipro.org/resource/Ecological_Sustainability_Policy.
pdf .
We have been following the guidelines of the ISO  14001 framework for more than a decade now as one of the  cornerstones of our Environmental Management System (EMS).
18 of our campus sites in India and 2 in Australia are certified to  the	standards	of	ISO	14001:2004.
Energy Efficiency & GHG Mitigation Our goal was to reduce the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG intensity  of	Wipro’s	operations	by	45%	over	a	4	year	period	:	from	2.42	MT	 per employee in 2010-11 to 1.3 MT per employee by 2014-15,  translating into a net reduction of nearly 60,600 tons for Wipro  IT business.
This target was applied to all of our campus facilities  and offices.
The goals for the next 5-10 years are currently being  framed using climate change based target setting methodology.
Energy Consumption: The total energy consumption, electricity  and back-up diesel generated, for office spaces across all global  operations in IT is 324 Mn Units (India contributes to 294  Mn units).
Data centers with in India and overseas (USA and  Germany) contribute to another 88 Mn units.
Office Space Energy Metrics: Energy efficiency measures  contributed to a 4 % decrease in office space energy intensity  from 2799 to 2686 units per employee per annum.
This is  primarily from (a) energy optimization measures, retrofit of  older equipment with more energy efficient equipment and  consolidation of operations accompanied by a transition from  leased to owned facilities with the resulting increase in overall  utilization of office space and better quality of maintenance  operations and (b) maintaining share of renewables at 22% of  the total office energy consumption.
Emissions Intensity: Our global office space emissions intensity  (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 1.74 tons per person per annum, a  decrease of 3.4% from last year.
This is still short of our five year  target of 1.3 tons, primarily due to constraints in scaling up our  renewable energy footprint.
03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   114 6/21/2015   4:09:10 PM Wipro Limited 115 Absolute Emissions: The dashboard below provides a summary  of our Global and India GHG emissions for Office spaces - from  Scope 1 (emission from direct energy consumption, like fuel)  and Scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity).
The figures  are net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions  for renewable energy procured.
The absolute Scope 1 and 2   emissions for 2014-15 has increased by around 5% primarily  due to increase in data center energy consumption by around  11 Mn units.
GHG Mitigation:  Our five year GHG mitigation consists of  three key elements – Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy (RE)  Purchase	and	Captive	RE;	of	this,	RE	procuremen t	will	contr ibute	 the maximum with 80% share to GHG emission mitigation  strategy.
Energy Efficiency: Over the preceding five year period, we have  implemented a variety of energy efficiency measures.
We were  one of the early adopters of Green Building Design with 19 of  our current buildings certified to the international LEED standard  (Silver,	Gold,	and	Platinum).
Since 2007, we have been working on a server rationalization and  virtualization program, through which we have decommissioned  old physical servers and replaced the processing capacity with  virtualization technology on fewer numbers of servers.
As of  March 2015, we have 2088 virtual servers running on 147 physical  servers – contributing to an energy savings of approximately 9  Million units annually, an increase of 3% over the previous year.
RE procurement:  For the reporting period of 2014-15, we  procured	65	Mn	units	of	Renewable	energy	through	PPAs	(Pow er	 Purchase	agreements)	with	priva te	producers ,	which	contr ibuted	 to approximately 22% of our total office space energy  consumption in the IT business.
However this fell significantly  short of our target of 130 Mn units for the reporting year.
While we have an ambitious renewable target, renewables do  bring in embedded environmental costs through materials and  land use change, including emerging socio-economic challenges  related to land acquisition and sustainability of promoters and  their financing.
One cannot discount the fact that the technology  itself is maturing and in many areas the infrastructure is not yet in  place to enable large scale evacuation and storage of renewable  power.
The	renewable	energy	trading/purchase	mechanism	 (REC- Renewable Energy Certificate) for open access consumers  like India is regulated to the extent that the prices are not market  determined and are fixed by the regulators.
Moreover each state  in India has its own mechanism on effecting access to open  access.
This has led to a gap in meeting our renewables targets.
It  can be said that it will take a few years before the market matures.
The mainstay of accessing RE for open access consumers like  us has been through direct power purchase agreement from  producers in select states.
In order to avoid double accounting,  we have taken adequate steps by including non-tradability of  80% 15% 5% GHG Mitigation Approach Energy Efficiency RE Generation RE Purchase GHG - Scope 1 and 2 Tons CO2 eq.

Captive RE: 	The	pilot	rooftop	Solar	PV	installations	at	3	of	our	 campuses followed by extensive use of solar water heaters in our  guest blocks and cafeterias have resulted in equivalent savings  of 1.6 Mn units of grid electricity.
Scope 3 Emissions: A summary of our Scope 3 emissions (other  indirect sources) is provided here.
Out of the 15 categories of  scope 3 reporting as per the new GHG corporate value chain  standard, we are presently reporting on all of the 8 applicable  categories.
The Scope 3 graph only includes emissions from Business  Travel, Commute, Waste and Logistics to enable year on year  comparison The overall emissions across all scopes is 406855 tons.
This does not include conveyance claims and some other minor scope 3  heads.
Within	this,	the	three	big	contr ibutors	to	our	GHG	emissions	are:	Electricit y	–	Purchased	and	Genera ted	(34%),	Business	Tra vel	 (21%) and Employee Commute (15%).
Business Travel:  The IT services outsourcing model requires  frequent travel to customer locations, mainly overseas, across the  delivery	life	cycle	and	contr ibutes	to	around	1/4th	of	our	over all	 emissions footprint.
This includes air, bus, train, local conveyance  and	hotel	stays .
Policies	on	usage	of	differen t	modes	of	trav el	 based on distance and time taken, need based travel approval  and shift towards processes which enable travel planning  by employees themselves are some of the cost and process  optimization measures implemented over past few years.
Employee Commute: Employees have various choices for  commuting informed primarily by distance, flexibility, work  timings, costs, city infrastructure and connectivity in the case  of group or public transport.
In addition to company arranged  transport (51%), employees utilize public transport (~35%),  with owned cars and two wheelers accounting for the balance.

Emissions during product use and end of life treatment of sold  products: Wipro ceased its hardware manufacturing business in  2013.
The number of units being sold is negligible and hence  going forward in-use emissions from products sold will not be  applicable.
03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   116 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM Wipro Limited 117 Water Efficiency and Responsible Use At Wipro, we view water from the three inter-related lens of  Conservation, Responsibility and Security; our articulated  goals are therefore predicated on these three dimensions.
•	 Water	Efficiency - Improve water efficiency (fresh water  use per employee) by 5% year on year •	 Water	Responsibility  - To ensure responsible water  management in proximate communities, especially in  locations that are prone to water scarcity •	 Water	Security	- Recognizing water availability as a  business risk, to proactively assess and plan for the water  security of the organization in a manner that is congruent  with other two goals.
Freshwater recycling and efficiency: The per employee water  consumption for the reporting year is 1.387 m3 per month as  compared to 1.46 in 2013-14, an improvement of around 7.6%.
We recycle 959620 m3 of water in 24 of our major locations,  (888828	in	2013-14)	using	Sewage	Trea tment	Plants	(STPs),	 which represents 35% (32% in 2013-14) of the total water  consumed.
The percentage of this recycled water as a percentage  of freshwater extracted is around 54%.
The reduction in  freshwater consumption has been primarily through demand  side optimization, reduction in pipeline leakages and increasing  water governance by building user awareness and involvement  of water plumbers.
We launched a program in 2013 with the aim to minimize  freshwater consumption by 20% over the following two years  through	an	integrated	approach: 1)  Implement Standard metering infrastructure and  procedures across campuses 2)  Demand side optimization (improving efficiency through  flow restrictors across campuses and arresting leakages), 3)   Improving recycling levels through ultra-filtration using it  for other non-contact purposes 4)  Integrating rain water harvesting into the consumption  side water cycle of the campus.
Sourcing of Water:  Water is withdrawn from four sources -  ground water, municipal water supplies, private purchase and  harvested rain water – with the first two sources accounting for  nearly 61% of the sourced water.
The majority of the balance 39%  is from private sources near our operational facilities.
The water  supplied by the municipal bodies and the industrial association  are in turn sourced primarily from river or lake systems.
Water  that is purchased from private sources can be traced to have  been primarily extracted from ground water.
Community Water Programs:  Wipro partners with experts  organizations, action groups and government bodies to  address issues affecting the communities in the vicinity of our  organizations.
As part of our Responsible Water program, we  aim to create a community centered participatory approach for  management of ground water.
Participatory	Aquifer	Mapping	(PAQM): Ground water is a  primary source of water in Bengaluru, especially for peripheral  areas of the city which are not connected to the city municipal  supply (BWSSB).
Around 40% of total water requirement of the  city is met through ground water, which is largely unregulated.
It is a scarce resource and many areas including the South east  areas (Electronics City- Sarjapur-Bellandur-Whitefield corridor)  are severely stressed.
There is a high reliance on private supply  (tanker) of water, the source of which is again mostly ground  water.
Ground water being a shared common pool resource,  the governance choices are complex – from unregulated to  centralised responses to community centered management.
PAQM	Program	Stakeholders Through this three year program which started in March 2014,  we aim to pilot a community centered participatory approach  to management of ground water.
The watershed area for this  program extends for approximately 35 square kilometers around  our corporate campus in Bangalore.
The	key	outcomes	of	the	program	from	the	first	year	are: a)	 On-	site	field	data	collection:		A	large	group	of	students	 from Christ University, Bengaluru along with earthian program  (www.earthian.in)  interns , involvement from employees,  PAQM ACWADAM MAPUNITYCGWB Builders Local Citizen  Groups Borewell  Drilling  Agencies Traditional  Borewell  Diggers BIOME Wipro Government -  Urban & Local  bodies 03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   117 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM 118 Annual Report 2014-15 were facilitated by International Union of Conservation Network  (IUCN) at Kolkata and Bangalore on Wetlands and Urban  Biodiversity.
Pollution and Waste Management  Our goals for pollution and waste management are the  following.
•	 100%	of	org anic	wast e	to	be	hand led	in-h ouse	at	owne d	 locations by end of 2014-15  •	 100%	of	paper ,	cardb oard,	hazardou s	and	e-w aste,	mixed	 metals/scrap	and	plastics	to	be	recy cled/	handled	as	per	 approved methods by end of 2014-15.
•	 Reduce	Mixed	solid	waste	intensit y	to	half	by	2017	(3	 year target) as compared to 2013-14 •	 Reduce	landfill	intensit y	to	half	by	2017	(3	year	target)	 as compared to 2013-14 Pollution	of	air and water poses one of the most serious threats  to community health and welfare.
Our waste management  strategies are centered on either (i) recycling the waste for  further use or (ii) arranging for safe disposal.
To operationalize  our strategy, we follow robust processes of segregating waste  into organic, inorganic, e-waste, hazardous, packaging, and  biomedical and other categories, which is then either recycled  in-house or through outsourced vendor arrangements.
90% of the total solid waste of 4562 tons generated from our IT  India operations is reused or recycled –through both, in-house  recycling units and through authorized vendor tie-ups.
The  balance, which is largely soiled tissue and mixed solid waste  and Mixed scrap (MSW) is landfilled.
Our plan is to reduce  MSW generation at source and further drive segregation into  recyclable organic-inorganics to increase diversion from landfills.
We are also piloting recycling options for difficult categories  like Thermocol and construction debris.
The comprehensive  external waste assessment we conducted across our locations  for electronic waste and solid waste streams pointed to areas of  improvement in governance and traceability of waste streams  across the recycler ecosystem.
We would work with our partners  and vendors in driving better practices and behaviours keeping  in mind both human and ecological impacts of any changes.

Biodiversity As an organization with large campuses in urban settings,  we are acutely conscious of our responsibility towards urban  diversity and have set for ourselves the following goals.
•	 To	convert	five	of	our	existing	campuses	to	biodiversity	 zones by 2017 •	 All	new	campuses	will	incorpor ate	biodiversity	principles	 into their design In our approach towards campus biodiversity, our program takes  an integrated approach towards the contribution in reducing  energy and carbon intensity and improving water retention  and harvesting.
The first stage of our campus biodiversity project - the butterfly  park – was completed in March 2013.
The park is witness to  hundreds of migratory butterflies who stop over in the park for  nearly a month in their 400 Km pre monsoon annual migration  from western to the Eastern Ghats in India.
The second phase  of the project, a ~3 acre Wetland park, is currently underway and  expected to be completed in 2015.
We have started work on biodiversity retrofit projects at our two  campuses	in	Pune	with	a	baseline	assessment	of	flora	and	fauna	 biodiversity.
This project envisages thematic gardens – aesthetic  and palm garden, spring garden, Ficus garden, spice and fruit  garden – through plantations of native spaces specific to the  local geography.
For one the pune campuses, the total number  of native species has nearly trebled from 49 to 167 in the first year.
The Electronics City biodiversity project featured as case study  in	a	CII	publication	released	at	Confer ence	of	Parties	at	Korea.
Wipro is one of the five member companies in India of “Leaders  for Nature (LFN)” , a joint initiative of IUCN, Confederation of  Indian Industries (CII), Hivos, and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).
In all these programs we work closely with expert partners  in biodiversity, conservation, ecological design and  communications.
Building employee connect through expert  talks, workshops and field visits to community research centers  in forests, is a critical aspect of the program.
Industry workshops  03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   118 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM Wipro Limited 119 Update on sub-category waste goals Sub-goals Update 100% of organic waste to be handled in-house in all owned  locations before end of 14-15  75% of waste is being handled in-house.

Internal audits are done as part of EHS.
A continuing external audit program is proposed to be started Reduce Mixed solid waste intensity to reduce by 50%  by 2017  with 13-14 as the baseline year Baseline of 13-14 is  3.26 kg per employee per annum  Target	of	2016-17:is		1.63	Kg	per	employee	per	annum  Actuals	as	of	2014-15:	3.16	Kg	per	employee	per	annum  Landfill intensity is unchanged at 3.13 Kg per employee per  annum E-waste audit recommendations to be actioned.
Pilot	study	program	covering	15	companies	in	Electronics	City	 region (Bengaluru) to start in 2015 We	monitor	diesel	generat or	stack	emissions	(NOx,	Sox	and	SPM)	and	indoor	air	quality	(CO ,	CO2 ,	VOC’s,	RSPM	are	the	key	parameters)	 across locations every month.
These meet the specified regulatory norms.
We continually assess operational risks to the environment and apply the precautionary principle in our approach to get insights and  plan – for example, the responsible water program and waste life cycle audits.
In the reporting period, there were no instances of  environmental fines imposed or negative consequences due to our operations.
We proactively monitor regulatory compliances with  respect to air, water and waste – and the emissions and waste generated by the organization are based on updated and approved  consents	as	on	date	from	respectiv e	Stat e	and	Centr al	Pollution	contr ol	boards.
We	also	have	not	receiv ed	any	show	cause/legal	 notices relating to the same.
We proactively respond to queries and clarifications received by regulatory bodies.

Businesses rely on this  natural capital to produce goods and deliver services.
They depend on natural non-renewable resources (for example, fossil fuels  and minerals) as well as natural renewable ecosystem goods and services (for example, freshwater and pollination).
Businesses  also rely on natural capital for its ability to absorb by-products of production such as pollution and water.
Business extraction  and production activities can damage natural capital with long term economic and social consequences.
These economic and social consequences manifest themselves as physical, regulatory and reputational risks for companies.
One  of the most useful ways for companies to account for these risks is to quantify and value the environmental impacts generated  across their value chains in monetary terms.
Traditional ‘single parameter’ environmental metrics such as cubic meters of water or hectares of land provide an indication  of the scale of dependency on ecosystem goods and services or environmental impacts.
However, they often fail to identify  optimization opportunities for business.
Natural capital valuation, on the other hand, provides a deeper insight because it factors  scale alongside critical environmental parameters such as regional water scarcity and the ecosystem services provided by land.
There are several global and country led projects underway which aim to develop environmental accounts and integrate them  with	traditional	national	accoun ts	(GDP)	including	India.
UNPRI,	in	2010,	estimated	the	environmen tal	costs	due	to	activities	of	 top   3000 companies at US$ 6 Trillion per year.
The Natural Capital Coalition (NCC), for example, is developing a Natural Capital  Protocol	to	provide	a	standardized	approach	to	natural	capital	accounting	and	valuation	for	businesses.
Wipro, in association with Trucost, completed its first natural capital valuation exercise for the previous financial year 2013-14.
The  valuation for 2014-15 will be completed by Aug 2015 – however it is unlikely to be significantly different.
The valuation looks at  our	global	operational	footprin t	-	from	energy	relat ed	emissions,	wat er	consumption,	air/wat er	pollution,	waste	generation	and,	 land use change, business travel, employee commute – as well as from the embedded natural capital in all goods and services  that we procure from our supply chain.
The natural capital embedded in goods and services is primarily based on valuation  methodology that is based on Trucost’s econometric Input-Output model which takes in spend across different sub-categories  of procurement.
Monetization of impacts is based on emerging models and a selection of global and local factors - hence certain  assumptions and accounting rules are inherent to the exercise.
The largest contributions came from GHG emissions (50%), water  abstraction (18%) and air pollution (19%).
The operational value chain stage accounted for 38% of Wipro’s total environmental  cost.
From a geography perspective, as expected, India accounts for 86% of the overall environmental cost.
For details of the  study refer to www.wiprosustainabilityreport.com/natural-capital-valuation/.
For Wipro, this study provides useful indicators to understand impacts and assess the value of our environmental programs.
For  external stakeholders like customers and analysts, these data points provide a completely transparent full life-cycle understanding  of our environmental footprint.
03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   120 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM Wipro Limited 121 Value Chain Sustainability  In	this	section	we	focus	on	our	engagement	with	two	major	stakeholders	in	our	value	chain:	suppliers	and	customers.
We	realize	that	 the impacts of our business do not end within our boundaries, but are felt across the ecosystem and stakeholders in the value chain.
Supply chain Sustainability Management Approach: The	supply	chain	sustainability	progr am	of	Wipro	rests	on	four	pillars:	ethical,	ecological ,	responsible	and	local.
Encompassing	 these pillars are governance and management frameworks, which help in communicating our expectations, build awareness  and set us on a path of continuous improvement.
PILLARS INITAITIVES Ecological:	Protecting	the	environment Natural Capital Accounting Study Ethical: 	Engaging 	beyond	compliance 	&	evaluating 	and	 controlling exposure to risks Responsible:	Ensure	ethical	labour	practices Supplier	Engagement	Program •	 Communicating	Code	of	Conduct •	 Audits	&	Assessments •	 Incorporation	in	procurement	criteria Partner	Employee	Engagement	Initi			ative	(GIS	business	unit) Diverse	and	Loc al:	Pro moting	div ersity	in	sup ply	cha in	and	 local sourcing Supplier	Diversity	Program Local	Procurement Performance Update Supplier Engagement Program: As the first step in our Supply  Chain Engagement program, it is now made mandatory for  the suppliers to accept and sign the supplier code of conduct  (SCOC).
Apart from communicating key requirements in business  practices, environmental and social aspects to the suppliers  through SCOC, Supplier meet with about 150 key Suppliers  of Wipro (IT business) was organized for the second time in  August, 2014.
A Supplier Awards program was also instituted  this financial year as part of Supplier Meet to recognize the key  contributions made by Suppliers.
A total of 12 awards across  multiple categories of awards based on supplier categories such  as Telecom, IT, Facilities, Business support services as well as  special category awards for innovation, sustainability, diversity  were given.
We have identified material issues across main procurement  categories – through desk based study conducted in 2013 as  well as a few internal and external audits over past two years.
Our focus is on human rights and labour practices and regulatory  compliance.
Our supplier engagement program integrates a  program of continuing evaluation, capacity building and risk  management.
We expect these steps to encourage responsible  behaviour from our partners.
We completed two independent audits which looked at security  service providers, waste recyclers and other facility management  service providers.
We also piloted food safety audits at two of  our campuses.
A dedicated vendor helpdesk handles supplier  queries on payment issues, policy clarifications and provides the  initial contact for grievance redressal.
Helpdesk received a total  of 3152 of vendor queries since January 2015, which reflects  the reach and effectiveness of our initiative.
The feedback from  our vendors received through this initiative helped us improve  our processes and initiate new steps like automation of sharing  payment advices, periodical validation of vendor credential  in our database as well as exchange of ideas between critical  vendors and our organization on possible process improvements  to ensure smooth interactions.
Our organization wide multi-lingual Ombuds process is available  24x7 (phone and internet enabled) for our Suppliers and  Contractors.
While a good proportion of ombuds process cases  are anonymous, based on self-disclosure, we know that there  were 33 complaints reported by suppliers during the year.
There  was an instance of serious supplier breach of our code of conduct  as a result four vendors have been blacklisted.
There have been  no instances related to anti-trust in the reporting period across  our business divisions.
Supplier Diversity: Wipro is an Equal Opportunity employer  and strongly advocates the same through its supply chain by  encouraging supplier diversity.
Qualified enterprises owned  by person with disability, women or member of minority  communities are identified and engaged with.
Diversity supplier  spend contributes to 5.2% of total central procurement tracked  spend for India operations.

Verego has rated us “Best in Class” across all the 5  areas	(Leadership,	Ethics,	People,	Community	and	Environmen t)	 and designated us as a “CSR Thought Leader” “ .
Education and Community Management Approach: Our social transformation initiatives are now more than a  decade old.
Over the years, our approach has been to engage  in critical social issues with sensitivity, rigor and responsibility.
Education and Community Care are the two areas that we  decided focus on when we started twelve years back.
The  reasons for this deliberate set of choices have the same  compelling validity today as they had then.
•	 Education	is	probably	the	most	important	catalyst	of	 social development which can bring about change that is  truly sustainable and durable over the long term; and  •	 It	is	a	fundamental	responsibility	and	tenet	of	corpor ate	 citizenship that every business should engage deeply with  its proximate communities and to try to address some of  their biggest challenges Measuring outcomes in social programs: In the sections  below, we have summarized work in different programs in  terms of Input, Output and Outcome.
This is the first attempt at  representing our work using such a framework.
Our inputs to the  program and the outputs from it have been easier to discern.
Deriving the outcomes has been more challenging.
We have tried  to assess the outcomes at two levels – the project or intervention  level and at the level of the partner organization.
The outcomes  have been drawn from our interactions with the field, project  reviews with partners and our partners’ own observations and  records from the field.
These have not been assessed or verified  independently.
In future we aim to do this as well as qualify the  long term impacts of some of our longer running programs.
CSR Spend: The CSR spend disclosed in Director’s Report is of  ` 1327.04  Mn.
We believe that our community engagement initiatives  should cover all our significant areas of operations.
The Science  Education	Fellow ship	(SEF)	Prog ram,	an	integ ral	part	of	our	 community and education program,  engages with and aims to  build teaching capacities in the disadvantaged communities of  three cities in the U.S. For more information on this programme,  refer	to	Page	No.

The	spend	on	SEF	progr am	for	2014-15	 was ` 79.1 Mn.
This amount is not accounted in the CSR Report  (Page:	66)	as	the	CSR	gui delines	in	the	Com panies	Act	201 3	 does not allow reporting of spend in countries outside India.
Wipro’s actual spend on CSR initiatives for 2014-15, including  this,  amounts to ` 1406.14 Mn.
Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS)  This financial year, Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS)  widened the scope of our programme to new domains  like primary school mathematics and integrated learning  programmes for rural youth.
Also extended our reach to newer  geographies through 6 new partnerships in the North-East,  Maharashtra,	Kerala,	Karna taka,	Punjab	and	Meghalay a.
Another	 significant step was the program focused on education for  children with disabilities which began this year with the objective  to establish models of inclusive education to include children  with disabilities into mainstream education.

03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   123 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM 124 Annual Report 2014-15 WATIS is a social initiative working on building capacities in  school education reform in India.
The intent is to contribute  towards systemic improvement of the Indian school education  system.
Our key strategy has been organizational capability  building of civil society organizations across the country, in order  to have a multiplier effect on education in India.
We partner  with civil society organizations and support them to develop  and enhance their capacity in working for systemic reform  in education.
We support organizations through project and  programmatic grants to develop and pilot innovative ideas and  practices and also to work with various stakeholders to build  capacity in the system, to implement these ideas and further  educational reform across different contexts and geographies  in the country.
Over the past 14 years, we have associated with 60 organizations  at different levels and worked closely with 35 organizations.
Our work with them has primarily been through 67 educational  projects, involving over 2300 schools and 13,250 educators  across 17 states reaching out to about 1 million students.
Wipro Science Education Fellowship  Program in the U.S.A. Wipro	Science	Education	Fellow ship	Prog ram	launched	in	March	 2013 is focused on improving Science and Math education  in schools primarily serving disadvantaged communities in  US cities.
The program is currently launched in Chicago, New  Jersey,	New	York	and	Boston	in	partnership	with	Michigan	Stat e	 University (MSU) and University of Massachusetts (UMass).
The  goal of the two year capacity development program is to improve  teaching capacity and promote science, technology, engineering  and math (STEM) education in their respective schools.
The process of selection of teachers for the Chicago program  began in Q1 of 2014.
The selected teachers started training  under the fellowship for a year which will be followed by another  year of follow-up sessions.
37 teachers (19 from NJ and 18 from  Boston) from the first cohort of the Boston program which began  in March 2013 have successfully completed their 1 year training  and	have	worked	on	their	‘Gro wth	Plan	Syst ems’	with	their	 UMass advisors.

Earthian - The Sustainability Program for  Schools and Colleges  Earthian Awards: In the 2014 – 2015 edition of earthian- the  annual	Sustainability	Prog ram	for	Schools	and	Colleges,	we	 reached out to more than 10000 schools and college and over  350 schools and 170 colleges participated in the event.
Owing  to our outreach initiatives, this edition became a highly inclusive  program with massive participation and even winners from  rural and semi-rural India.
The 10 best entries from schools and  colleges each were selected by an eminent jury with varied  experience in academia, research and civil society organization  and were presented with awards at the earthian award event  in February 2015.
CEP (Continuous Engagement Program): The 10 earthian  winning schools and colleges from the earlier 2013-14 edition  have	been	engaged	in	the	Continuous	Engagement	Prog ram	 (CEP)	offered	in	association	with	Wipro ’s	partner	ecosyst em	in	 education and sustainability.
The core focus of this engagement  is of driving sustainability thinking and action through the  learning process.
As part of the school engagement program, introductory  Sustainability workshops for schools have been completed in  14 schools across the country with the participation of 250  plus	teachers.
A	new	CEP	school	portal	is	now	live	with	over	80	 teachers across India pre-registered and officially inducted into  the	CEP	program.
For	college	students	from	winning	institutes,	 earthian offered five Internships with 3 organizations (Trucost,  BIOME	&	CSTEP)	who	are	domain	specialists	in	sustainability	 and related areas.
Also in line with our long term vision to further sustainability  education	in	India,	WIPRO	and	IIMB	embarked	on	a	broad	 collaboration of which an integral part is the curation of national  forum of leading Business Schools from across the country.
The first edition of this program - a ‘Symposium on Advancing  Sustainability Research and Education’ for B-schools saw the  participation of top 13 Business schools in India represented by  core faculty engaged in sustainability education.
Mission 10X In the financial year 2014-2015, 76 Academic Leadership  Workshops,	1003	Faculty	Empower ment	Workshops ,	91	UTLP	 Practitioner’s	workshops	and	614	Student	Engineering	Thinking	 workshops were organized under Mission10X programme.
Out  of the 54 Mission10X Technology Learning Centers (MTLCs)  operational in 12 states, 10 were established last year.
Overall  27,482 Engineering College Faculty have been trained and 1,300  colleges across the 29 states were covered through Mission10X  interventions.
Mission10X is a not-for-profit initiative of Wipro Limited which  was started on 5th Sept 2007 towards building the employability  skills of engineering students by training engineering college  teachers.
The first phase of Mission10X focused on training  teachers	on	Pedagogy	while	the	second	phase	has	focused	on	 “SMALLER	and	DEEPER	Engagement”	philosophy	where	a	set	 of selected Engineering colleges have been given a deeper  educational interventions.
The focus has been on creating the  21st Century skills amongst the learners who are predominantly  hired by the IT industry.
The following three essential attributes of  a	‘Graduate	engineer ’	are	cov ered	in	all	Mission10X	inter ventions: •	 Communication:	Ability	to	communicat e	with	others	for	 shared understanding in technical, behavioral, logistical and  practical concern.
03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   124 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM Wipro Limited 125 •	 Collaboration	(Team	work):	Ability	to	work	collabora tively	to	 explore possibilities to address the stated problem by drawing  knowledge from diverse professionals and backgrounds.
•	 Deeper	Learning:	Ability	to	learn	deeply	to	articulat e	a	 problem statement and analyze given data.
The needs of important stakeholders of engineering education  ecosystem such as principals, heads of the departments (HoDs),  faculty members and students are met through a program that  enhances overall learning incorporating structured engagement  and effective delivery systems.
Community Care - Wipro Cares   Wipro Cares is a program primarily focusing on developmental  challenges faced by communities in the domain of primary  health care, education, environment and disaster rehabilitation.
The communities we work with our largely proximate to where  Wipro has its presence.
2014-15 was an exciting year for Wipro Cares as we grew our  number of projects as well as added disability as an added  domain of engagement.
Our number of projects grew close to  three folds, from 11 in 2013-14 to 29 in 2014-15.
Out of the 29  projects, five were projects started under the ‘disability’ domain.
Primary Healthcare: Our primary health care projects typically  provide quality preventive and curative health care services to  underserved communities.
Through seven of our health care  projects, covering 75 villages across Maharashtra, Karnataka,  Andhra	Pradesh	&	Uttarak hand	we	are	providing	more	than	 75000 people access to primary health care.
Apart from  providing regular curative services ,the emphasis of these  projects are to build the capacities of the communities to  handle their primary health care needs, also leverage existing  government  infrastructure and schemes as a part of their health  rights.
Out of the seven health care projects, two new projects  that were started in 2014-15 were in Haridwar in Uttarakhand  and Aurangabad in Maharashtra.
Education: The education projects continued to provide  educational opportunities to underprivileged children, typically  children who are most marginalized due to their socio-economic  status, for example children of migrant laborers.
More than 50000  children benefited from the ten education projects in the cities  of	Pune,	Hyderabad,	Kolkata,	Mumbai	and	Chennai.
Out	of	the	 ten projects, six were added in 2014-15.
Disability:  In 2014, we included an additional theme of disability.
Through our ‘Education of children with disability’ projects, we  supported the educational and rehabilitative needs of 1350  underprivileged children with disabilities through five projects  in	the	cities	of	Bangalore,	Pune,	Jaipur	and	Hyder abad.
Under	 disability, our focus is on early intervention and inclusive  education to ensure that children with disabilities have access  to quality education and the opportunity to lead a life of dignity.
Social Forestry: Our project in social forestry has helped plant  more than a lakh trees, and has at the same time provided  livelihood to around 80 farmers.
In 2014 we also added the  aspect of adult literacy as a part of the social forestry project in  rural Tamil Nadu.
Another addition in 2014 was the inclusion of  solid waste management as a sub theme under the thematic  domain of Environment.
We are working on providing social and  nutrition security to waste workers along with upgrading their  skills to assist them in augmenting their livelihood and live a life  of dignity.
Our first project under the ‘solid waste management’  sub theme was started in Bangalore in 2014.
Disaster Rehabilitation: Through the years, we have supported  the causes of communities affected by Karnataka Floods, Bihar  Floods,	Japan	Tsunami,	Hurricane	Sandy	and	the	Philippines	 Cyclone.
In 2014-15 we supported communities affected by  the Uttarakhand Floods and the Odisha Cyclone in 2013.
In  Uttarakhand we initiated a project to work with 1000 families  on exploring alternative modes of livelihood to reduce their  economic dependence on tourism and increase their resilience  as a community.
In Odisha, we restored the livelihood of 250  families of the fishermen community by providing them fishing  nets and increasing their awareness on various existing social  security schemes.
These 250 families were from 15 villages of five  Gram	Panchayats	in	Polasara	Block	of	Ganjam	District.
Employee Engagement: Engaging employees continued to be  an integral part of Wipro Cares.
We encouraged employees to  volunteer with our partners, acting thus as catalysts in bringing  about positive change and also learning in the process.
We  currently have 15 volunteering chapters, seven in India and  nine overseas.
Wipro Cares organized a blood donation drive  for thallasaemics where 3256 units of blood were collected.
We  also continued celebrating ‘Joy of Giving @ Wipro, 2014’ across  WT,	WI,	WBPS,	WIN,	WCCLG	in	11	locations	in	India	and	UAE .
Advocacy and Outreach Management Approach: Given the fundamental axiom that sustainability is about  maximizing social and environmental ‘good’ , it requires an  engagement template that emphasizes informed advocacy  of the underlying issues amongst all stakeholders.
Each  stakeholder – Business, Government, Academia, and Civil  Society – brings a dynamic and energy to the table that is  unique and complementary.
We think that industry’s role must  go beyond its own boundaries and should be one that seeks  to vigorously promote advocacy of sustainability challenges.
In doing so, the conscious emphasis must be on the difficult  and the long term in preference to the easy and the short term.
Our areas of focus on policy and advocacy have centered on  Water, Energy and Climate Change, e-Waste, Education and  Diversity.
We work through industry platforms like CII, NASSCOM  as well as with research partners who carry expertise in these   domains.
Our primary identified stakeholders for public policy and  advocacy are 03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   125 6/21/2015   4:09:11 PM 126 Annual Report 2014-15 •	 Relevant	gover nment	ministries	and	departments ,	both	at	 the center and the states where we operate in ; Our interactions  have been largely with the Ministry of Environment and  Forests, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and Ministry  of Corporate Affairs •	 Industry	networ ks	and	associations	play	a	crucial	role	as	 catalysts for awareness, advocacy and action on the multiple  dimensions of sustainability; by providing a common platform  for industry representatives to share and exchange ideas  and practices, industry association can help foster a virtuous  cycle of feedback led improvement.
Industry networks also  lend strength and credibility in the dialogue process with  government on important matters of policy and directives.
The industry networks that we have been an integral part of  are: 	 •	 The 	CII-Godrej	Green	Business	Center	(GBC) 	•	 The 	CII-ITC	Center	for	Sustainable	Development •		 CII 	National	Environment	Committee •		 The 	Nasscom	working	groups	on	Gender	Diversity •		 The 	TERI-BCSD	forum •		 The 	CII	led	Indian	Business	for	Biodiversity	Initiativ e		   (CIIIBBI) •		 The 	Leaders	for	Nature	(LFN)	framewor k	of	the	India			    chapter of the International Union of Conservation     Networks (IUCN) •	 Research	and	Advocac y	NGOs:	 Issues like Energy, Climate  Change, Water, Biodiversity, Community Education, Health  etc.
require strong civil society involvement as the third pillar  along with government policy and business engagement.
NGOs and academic institutions, by combining the right  blend of field work and academic rigor can generate valuable  insights that can inform the work of practitioners, policy  makers and industry professionals.
Illustrative examples of  such	organizations	that	we	work	with	are	:	Carbon	Disclosure	 Project	in	the	area	of	Climate	Change,	BIOME	and	ACW ADAM	 in the area of Water, ATREE  and IUCN ( India chapter) in the  areas of Biodiversity , and our network of nearly 30 education  partners across the country.
The table below provides a summary of our major stakeholder engagements in advocacy and outreach Domain Brief highlights Water, Energy, Biodiversity,  Waste Management Energy: (i) In partnership with Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and IIM Bangalore, a research  study was done on the role of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector in  combating climate change.
The study report was released in October 2014 (ii) As a member of the TERI-BCSD	(	Business	Council	for	Sustainable	Developmen t) India  program, we participated in the program track on Energy Efficiency that seeks to advance best  practices on energy management and efficiency in different industry sectors Water continued to be a major area of collaborative focus for us in 2014-15.
The two  major advocacy platforms that we have been deeply involved in are summarized below   (i) Advancing the agenda of the Karnataka State Water Network (KSWN) along with the CII  Karnataka chapter.
The KSWN brings together stakeholders from government, academia, civil  society and business to address the most pressing issues in water in Bangalore and surrounding  areas.
Five area-wise clusters were formed with specific action plans drawn up for each  (ii)The Responsible Water program seeks to address the pressing issue of ground water in the  Sarjapur area in Bangalore.
It does this through a combination of scientific hydrogeology and  the involvement several citizen groups  as part of a unique decentralized governance framework Biodiversity:  Our participation in advocacy on biodiversity issues was through two national  levels forums – the CII-India Business for Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) and the Leaders for Nature  program from the India chapter of IUCN.
Our case study was featured in the IBBI publication that  was	released	at	the	COP	on	Biodiversity	in	Korea	in	Oct ober	2014,	Along	with	IUCN,	we	hosted	 an industry interaction on the Kolkata wetlands in our Kolkata center.
A similar interaction with  civil society was hosted at our Bangalore campus Waste Management: In collaboration with InfoActiv, an Australia based NGO organization  that focuses on e-Waste, we helped create a platform in the Electronic City Industrial area in  Bangalore, India.
This zone hosts a significant majority of IT companies and is therefore a source  of sizable amounts of e-Waste.
The platform will help align common focus areas, opportunities  and streamline the processes involved in the management of e-Waste from bulk consumers.
Apart from this, we continued to be part of the sub-committee on ‘Waste’ in the CII National  Environment Committee.
03_Business Responsibility Report_v6.indd   126 6/21/2015   4:09:12 PM Wipro Limited 127 Domain Brief highlights Horizontal areas in  Sustainability and CSR We continued to strengthen our participation in advocacy on the cause of corporate  sustainability as a whole  As Co-Chair of the CII-GBC Greenco forum (Bangalore chapter), the goal is to drive the adoption  of the ‘Greenco’ framework by industry at large in Bangalore and surrounding areas.
The Greenco  framework encourages companies to establish a multi-dimensional framework of ecological  sustainability	that	spans	the	areas	of	Energy,	Wat er,	Waste ,	Biodiversity	and	Produc t	Stew ardship.
We continued to actively participate in the debate around the CSR provisions of the Companies  Act 2013.
Our primary position has been that CSR as a mandate may not be the most effective  means of getting industry to engage on larger social issues.
We also believe that business  sustainability plays a critical role in moving the needle forward and must be included as part  of the provisions of the CSR rules.
Third, as a global corporate citizen, we think that CSR must  include community programs of all the countries that a company operates in and should not  be restricted to India School Education We supported a multi-state comparative study which is providing insights into how the  textbook markets operate in India; the outcomes of this study are expected to inform later  advocacy efforts.
Our work with partner organizations such as EZ Vidya to develop capacity in understanding and  supporting schools to do Continuous and Comprehensive Assessment (CCE) and SeasonWatch,  a national citizen science initiative, were covered in popular media Our social science program with Vikramshila was lauded as an exemplar way of imparting life  skills at a joint meeting organized by Jadavpur University and UNICEF The	proceedings	of	the	14th	annual	Partners ’	Forum	on	the	topic	of	‘Te xtbooks	and	Education ’	 and	of	the	13th	Partners ’	Forum	on	‘Assessmen ts	and	School	Education ’	have	been	published	 & distributed.
Summary videos of Forum sessions were also disseminated online through a  YouTube	channel Kamala Mukunda’s acclaimed book on child learning, ‘What did you ask at School Today’ , was  brought out in Hindi by Eklavya with our support.
The books has been distributed widely  among educational NGOs and also to over 500 District Institutes of Education and Training  (DIETs) across the country.

1st April 2014 to 31st March 2015.
Scope, Boundary  and Limitations of Assurance   The scope of work agreed upon with Wipro includes a moderate level of verification of the contents of the BRR including disclosures against nine principles of the  NVG, and reported in the Annual Report 2014-15 i.e.
review of the disclosures - policies, initiatives, practices and performance described in the Report as well as  references made in the Report.
The	reporting	boundary	covers	Wipro ’s	IT	business,	that	is,	Wipro	Inf otech,	Wipro	Technologies ,	Wipro	BPS	(Business	Pr ocess	Ser vices)	and	Wipro	Ec o	Energy	servic es.
During	the	verifica tion	process ,	there	were	no	limitations	encount ered	on	the	agreed	scope	for	the	engagement;	howev er,	the	financial	figures/data	disclosed	in	this	 Report is based on the financial data audited by the statutory auditors, and reported in the Company’s Annual Report 2014-15.
No external stakeholders were interviewed  as part of this assurance engagement.
Verification of data was was limited to review of aggregated data presented at the corporate office.
Methodology  This	assurance	engagement	was	planned	and	carried	out	in	accordance	with	VeriSustain	(DNV	GL	Pr otocol	for	Verifica tion	of	Sustainability	Repor ting).
The	Repor t	has	 been	evaluated	against	the	following	criteria:	 •	 Moderate	level	of	assurance,	as	set	out	in	VeriSustain;  •	 Alignment	of	the	BRR	to	the	NVG	principles	and	related	BRR	reporting	requirements	of	SEBI; As part of the engagement, we have verified the statements and claims made in the Report and assessed the robustness of the underlying data aggregation, information  flow	and	controls.
In	doing	so,	we	have:	 •	 Reviewed	the	Company’s	approach	to	addressing	the	BRR	requirements,	including	NVG	principles;  •	 Examined	and	reviewed	documents,	data	and	other	information	made	available	by	the	Company;	  •	 Visited	corporate	office	at	Sarjapur,	Bengaluru	to	conduct	verification;	  •	 Conducted	interviews	with	key	representatives	including	data	owners	and	decision-makers	of	the	Company;	  •	 Performed	sample-based	reviews	(for	moderate	level	of	verification)	of	the	mechanisms	for	implementing	the	Company’s	policies,	as	described	in	the	Report;  •	 Performed	sample-based	checks	of	the	processes	for	generating,	gathering	and	managing	the	quantitative	data	and	qualitative	information	included	in	the		  Report.
Conclusion  We have evaluated the Report against the reporting principles and framework with respect to materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, responsiveness, reliability,  neutrality	and	completeness.
In	our	opinion: •	 The	Report	aligns	itself	against	the	nine	principles	of	NVG	and	has	fairly	responded	to	the	reporting	framework	related	to	BRR;  •	 The	qualitative	and	quantitative	data	included	in	the	Report,	were	found	to	be	reliable,	identifiable	and	traceable;  •	 Report	along	with	the	references	made,	provides	a	fair	description	of	the	initiatives	taken	by	the	Company	from	the	Social,	Environmental	and	Governance			  perspectives;   •	 The	personnel	responsible	were	able	to	demonstrate	the	origin	and	interpretation	of	data.
On the basis of our verification methodology and scope of work agreed upon, nothing has come to our attention that would cause us not to believe that this report is  not materially correct and is not a fair representation of the data and information.
Opportunities for Improvement  The following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of the Company and are considered for drawing  our	conclusion	on	the	Report;	however	they	are	generally	consistent	with	the	management’s	objectives:	 •	 The	Company	may	report	sustainability	disclosures	relat ed	to	India	and	other	geo-locations	separat ely	for	the	benefit	of	stakeholders’	understanding	of	Wipro ’s		  sustainability perf ormance.
•	 The	scope	of	the	internal	audits	related	to	sustainability	could	be	expanded	to	include	social	aspects.
•	 Certain	policies	required	under	NVG	are	being	evolved	and	it	is	suggested	that	these	policies	may	be	defined	and	communicated	to	further	improve		 	  completeness of reporting against the policy requirements of the NVG.
•	 The	Report	may	explicitly	disclose	the	Company’s	position	statement	related	to	policies	against	the	requirements	of	reporting	on	“Principle -wise	(as	per	NVGs)		 	 BR 	Policy/policies”	under	“Section	D:	BR	Inf ormation”.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters  stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  with respect to the preparation of these financial statements  that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance  with the accounting principles generally accepted in India,  including the Accounting Standards specified under Section  133 of the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts)  Rules, 2014.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and  for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting policies;  making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls, that were operating  effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Those  Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the financial statements are free from material  misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial  statements.

Significant ac counting policies i.
Basis of preparation of financial statements  The financial statements are prepared in accordance  with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India  (GAAP) under the historical cost convention on the  accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments  which are measured on a fair value basis.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) read  with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014,  and the relevant provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 (“the 2013 Act”) / Companies Act, 1956 (“the 1956  Act”), as applicable, Accounting Standards (‘AS’) issued  by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI)   and other generally accepted accounting principles in  India.
All amounts included in the financial statements are  reported in millions of Indian rupees ( ` in millions)  except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated.
Due to rounding off, the numbers presented throughout  the document may not add up precisely to the totals  and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute  figures.
ii.
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at  the date of financial statements and reported amounts  of income and expenses during the year.
Estimates and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing  basis.
Revision to accounting estimates is recognised in  the year in which the estimates are revised and in any  future year affected.
iii.
Goodwill  The goodwill arising on acquisition of a group of assets is  not amortized and is tested for impairment if indicators of  impairment exist.
iv.
Fixed Asset   Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss, if any.
Costs include  expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of  the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  construction or production of qualifying assets are  capitalized as part of the cost.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted for as  separate items (major components) of property, plant and  equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property,  plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with these will  flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid for  acquisition less accumulated amortization and impairment  loss, if any.
Cost of fixed assets not ready for use before the balance  sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in-progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of fixed assets  outstanding as of each balance sheet date is disclosed  under long term loans and advances.
v.  Investments  Non-current investments are stated at cost less other than  temporary diminution in the value of such investments, if  any.
Current investments are valued at lower of cost and  fair value determined by category of investment.
The fair  value is determined using quoted market price/market  observable information adjusted for cost of disposal.
On  disposal of the investment, the difference between its  carrying amount and net disposal proceeds is charged or  credited to the statement of profit and loss.
vi.
Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods include  material cost and appropriate share of manufacturing  overheads.
Cost of inventories comprises all costs of  purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred  in bringing the inventories to their present location and  condition.
04_Wipro AR_Standalone Accnts_2015.indd   137 6/21/2015   4:11:15 PM Standalone Financial Statements 138 Annual Report 2014-15 vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities  Provisions are recognised when the Company has a  present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of obligation.
A disclosure for a c ontingent liability is made when there is  a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but  probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where  there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in  respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is  remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the  expected benefits to be derived from the contract are  lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the future  obligations under the contract.
viii.
Revenue recognition  The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware and  related services, business process services, sale of IT and  other products.
Services:   The Company recognizes revenue when the significant  terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have  been delivered and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method of recognizing the revenues and costs  depends on the nature of the services rendered: A.
Time and material contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and material contracts  are recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized  using the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage of completion is determined based on  project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total  estimated project costs required to complete the project.
The cost expended (or input) method has been used  to measure progress towards completion as there is a  direct relationship between input and productivity.
If the  Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure the  progress of completion or to estimate the total contract  revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only to the  extent of contract cost incurred for which recoverability is  probable.
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an  arrangement, the estimated losses are recognized in the  statement of profit and loss in the period in which such  losses become probable based on the current contract  estimates.
‘Unbilled rev enues’ represent cost and earnings in excess  of billings as at the end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned  revenues’ represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.
Advance payments received from customers for which no  services have been rendered are presented as ‘Advance  from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance Contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably  over the period of the contract using the percentage of  completion method.
When services are performed through  an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified  period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the specified period unless some other method  better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output  units is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term.
In such  contracts, revenue is recognized with respect to the  actual output achieved till date as a percentage of total  contractual output.
Any residual service unutilized by the  customer is recognized as revenue on completion of the  term.
D.  Others  	 •	 The 	Compan y	accoun ts	for	volume	discoun ts	and	 pricing incentives to customers by reducing the  amount of revenue recognized at the time of sale.
•	 The 	Com pany	acc rues	the	est imated	cos t	of	war ranties	 at the time when the revenue is recognized.
The  accruals are based on the Company’s historical  experience of material usage and service delivery  costs.
•	 Costs 	that	relat e	directly	to	a	contr act	and	incurred	 in securing a contract are recognized as an asset and  amortized over the contract term.
•	 Contract 	expenses	are	recog nised	as	expenses	by	 reference to the stage of completion of contract  activity at the end of the reporting period.
Products:  Revenue from sale of products is recognised when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership has been  transferred in accordance with the sales contract.
Revenue  from product sales is shown net of excise duty and net of  sales tax separately charged and applicable discounts.
Other income:  Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion method,  based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is rec ognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
04_Wipro AR_Standalone Accnts_2015.indd   138 6/21/2015   4:11:15 PM Standalone Financial Statements Wipro Limited 139 ix.
Leases  Leases of assets, where the Company assumes substantially  all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as  finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the lower  of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the  present value of minimum lease payments.
Lease payments  are apportioned between the finance charge and the  outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to  periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate  of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease rentals in respect of assets taken under operating  leases are charged to statement of profit and loss on a  straight line basis over the lease term.
In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross finance receivables, unearned  interest income and the estimated residual value of the  leased equipment on consummation of such leases.
Unearned interest income represents the excess of the  gross finance lease receivable plus the estimated residual  value over the sales price of the equipment.
The Company  recognizes unearned interest income as financing revenue  over the lease term using the effective interest method.
x.
Foreign currency transactions  The Company is exposed to currency fluctuations on foreign  currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions are  accounted in the books of account at the exchange rates  prevailing on the date of transaction.
Transaction:  The difference between the rate at which foreign currency  transactions are accounted and the rate at which they are  realized is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.
Translation:  Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities at period- end are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the  date of Balance Sheet.
The difference arising from the  translation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss,  except for the exchange difference arising on monetary  items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash flow  hedge or hedge of a net investment in a non-integral  foreign operation.
In such cases the exchange difference is  initially recognised in hedging reserve or Foreign Currency  Translation Reserve (FCTR), respectively.
Such exchange  differences are subsequently recognised in the statement  of profit and loss on occurrence of the underlying  hedged transaction or on disposal of the investment,  respectively.
Further, foreign currency differences arising  from translation of intercompany receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, the settlement of which  is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future,  are considered to form part of net investment in foreign  operation and are recognized in FCTR.
When a foreign  operation is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized  in FCTR is transferred to the statement of profit and loss as  part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The amended AS 11 provides an irrevocable option to the  Company to amortise exchange rate fluctuation on long  term foreign currency monetary asset/liability over the  life of the asset/liability or March 31, 2020, whichever is  earlier.
The amendment is applicable retroactively from  the financial year beginning on or after December 7, 2006.
The Company did not elect to exercise this option.
xi.
Financial Instruments  Financial instruments are recognised when the Company  becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  instrument.
Derivative instruments and Hedge accounting:  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in a  non-integral foreign operation and forecasted cash flows  denominated in foreign currency.
The Company limits the  effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following  established risk management policies including the use of  derivatives.
The Company enters into derivative financial  instruments, where the counterparty is primarily a bank.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward  contracts taken to hedge foreign currency risk of an existing  asset / liability is recognised in the statement of profit and  loss over the period of the contract.
Exchange differences  on such contracts are recognised in the statement of profit  and loss of the reporting period in which the exchange  rates change.
The Company has adopted the principles of Accounting  Standard 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition  and Measurement (AS 30) issued by ICAI except to  the extent the adoption of AS 30 does not conflict  with existing accounting standards prescribed by  Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and other authoritative  pronouncements.
In accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles set out in AS 30, changes in fair value of derivative  financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are  recognised directly in shareholders’ funds and reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence  of the hedged transaction.
Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective  portion of the hedges and derivative instruments that do  not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is  determined based on observable market inputs including  04_Wipro AR_Standalone Accnts_2015.indd   139 6/21/2015   4:11:15 PM Standalone Financial Statements 140 Annual Report 2014-15 currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency  volatility etc.
xii.
Depreciation and amortization  The Company has provided for depreciation using straight  line method over the useful life of the assets as prescribed  under part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013  except in the case of following assets which are depreciated  based on useful lives estimated by the Management: Class of asset Estimated  useful life Buildings 28 – 40 years Computer including telecom equipment and  software (included under plant and machinery)  2 – 7 years Furniture and fixtures  5 – 6 years Electrical installations (included under plant  and machinery)  5 years Vehicles  4 years  For the class of assets mentioned above, based on internal  technical assessment the management believes that the  useful lives as given above best represent the period over  which management expects to use these assets.
Hence  the useful lives for these assets are different from the  useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful  life on a straight line basis.
Payments for leasehold land are amortised over the period  of lease.
Fixed assets individually costing Rupees five thousand or  less are depreciated at 100% over a period of one year.
Assets under finance lease are amortised over their  estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is lower.
xiii.
Impairment of assets  Financial assets:  The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether  there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or  group of financial assets is impaired.
If any such indication  exists, the Company estimates the amount of impairment  loss.
The amount of loss for receivables is measured as  the difference between the assets carrying amount and  undiscounted amount of future cash flows.
Reduction,  if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
If at the balance sheet date there is any indication that  a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists,  the recognised impairment loss is reversed, subject to  maximum of initial carrying amount of the short-term  receivable.
Other than financial assets:   The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether  there is any indication that a non-financial asset including  goodwill may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable  amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset  belongs to is less than its carrying amount, the carrying  amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The reduction  is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
If at the balance sheet date  there is an indication that a previously assessed impairment  loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed  and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject  to a maximum of depreciated historical cost.
In respect of  goodwill, the impairment loss will be reversed only when  it was caused by specific external events of an exceptional  nature that is not expected to recur and their effects have  been reversed by subsequent external events.
xiv.
Employee benefits  Provident fund:   Employees receive benefits from a provident fund.
The  employee and employer each make monthly contributions  to the plan.
A portion of the contribution is made to the  provident fund trust managed by the Company, while the  remainder of the contribution is made to the Government  administered pension fund.
The Company is generally  liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the  government specified minimum rate of return.
Compensated absences:  The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated  absences.
The employees can carry forward a portion of  the unutilized accumulating compensated absences and  utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement  or termination of employment.
The Company records an  obligation for compensated absences in the period in  which the employee renders the services that increases  this entitlement.
The Company measures the expected  cost of compensated absences as the additional amount  that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused  entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the  reporting period.
The Company recognizes accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation  carried out by independent actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
Non-accumulating compensated  absences are recognized in the period in which the  absences occur.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains  and losses immediately in the statement of profit and loss  account.
Gratuity:  In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the  Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible  04_Wipro AR_Standalone Accnts_2015.indd   140 6/21/2015   4:11:15 PM Standalone Financial Statements Wipro Limited 141 employees, at retirement or termination of employment  based on the last drawn salary and years of employment  with the Company.
The gratuity fund is managed by the Life  Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), HDFC Standard Life,  TATA AIG life and Birla Sun-life.
The Company’s obligation  in respect of the gratuity plan, which is a defined benefit  plan, is provided for based on actuarial valuation carried  out by an independent actuary using the projected unit  credit method.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains  and losses immediately in the statement of profit and loss.
Superannuation:   Superannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme,  is administered by the LIC and ICICI Prudential Life  Insurance Company Limited.
The Company makes annual  contributions based on a specified percentage of each  covered employee’s salary.
xv.
Employee stock options  The Company determines the compensation cost based  on the intrinsic value method.
The compensation cost  is amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting  period.
xvi.
Taxes  Income tax:  The current charge for income taxes is calculated in  accordance with the relevant tax regulations.
Tax liability  for domestic taxes has been computed under Minimum  Alternate Tax (MAT).
MAT credit are being recognized if  there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay  normal tax after the tax holiday period and the resultant  asset can be measured reliably.
The excess tax paid under  MAT provisions being over and above regular tax liability  can be carried forward for a period of ten years from the  year of recognition and is available for set off against future  tax liabilities computed under regular tax provisions, to the  extent of MAT liability.
Deferred tax:  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the  future tax consequences attributable to timing differences  that result between the profit offered for income taxes and  the profit as per the financial statements of the Company.
Deferred taxes are recognised in respect of timing  differences which originate during the tax holiday period  but reverse after the tax holiday period.
For this purpose,  reversal of timing difference is determined using first in first  out method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax  rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the balance sheet date.
The effect on deferred  tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised  in the period that includes the enactment/substantive  enactment date.
Deferred tax assets on timing differences are recognised  only if there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future  taxable income will be available against which such deferred  tax assets can be realized.
However, deferred tax assets on  the timing differences when unabsorbed depreciation  and losses carried forward exist, are recognised only to  the extent that there is virtual certainty that sufficient  future taxable income will be available against which such  deferred tax assets can be realized.
Deferred tax assets are reassessed for the appropriateness  of their respective carrying amounts at each balance sheet  date.
The Company offsets, on a year on year basis, the current  and non-current tax assets and liabilities, where it has a  legally enforceable right and where it intends to settle such  assets and liabilities on a net basis.
xvii.
Earnings per share   Basic:   The number of equity shares used in computing basic  earnings per share is the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year excluding equity shares  held by controlled trusts.
Diluted:   The number of equity shares used in computing diluted  earnings per share comprises the weighted average  number of equity shares considered for deriving basic  earnings per share, and also the weighted average number  of equity shares that could have been issued on the  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as  of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity  shares are adjusted for any stock splits and bonus shares  issued.
xviii.
Cash flow statement  Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the effects  of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or  accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments.
The  cash flows from regular revenue generating, investing and  financing activities of the Company are segregated.

As per the plan, the Company’s India operations have  export obligations to the extent of net positive foreign  exchange (i.e.
foreign exchange inflow - foreign exchange  outflow should be positive) over a five year period.
The  consequence of not meeting this commitment in the future  would be a retroactive levy of import duties on certain  hardware previously imported duty free.
As at March 31,  2015, the Company has met all commitments required  under the plan.
Tax Demands:  Company received a tax demand for year ended March 31,  2001 arising primarily on account of denial of deduction  under section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (Act) in  respect of profit earned by the Company’s undertaking  in Software Technology Park at Bangalore.
The same issue  was repeated in the successive assessments for the years  ended March 31, 2002 to March 31, 2010 and the aggregate  demand is ` 46,515 (including interest of ` 13,673).
The  appeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate  authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by  the second appellate authority for the years up to March  31, 2007.
Further appeals have been filed by the Income  tax authorities before the Hon’ble High Court.
The Hon’ble  High Court has heard and disposed off the appeals up to  years ended March 31, 2004.
Order of the Hon’ble High  Court is not yet received.
On similar issues for years prior to years ended March 31,  2001, the Hon’ble High Court in Karnataka has upheld the  claim of the Company under section 10A of the Act.
For the  year ended March 31, 2008, March 2009, the appeals are  pending before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal).
For year ended March 31, 2010, the Dispute Resolution  Panel (DRP) allowed the claim of the Company under  section 10A of the Act.
The Income tax authorities have  filed an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March  31, 2011, the Company received the draft assessment order  in March 2015, on similar grounds as that of earlier years,  with a demand of ` 7,852 (including interest of ` 2,547) for  the financial year ended March 31, 2011.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the  order of the appellate authority/Hon’ble Karnataka High  Court upholding the claims of the Company for earlier  years, the Company believes that the final outcome of the  above disputes should be in favor of the Company and  there should not be any adverse impact on the financial  statements.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
The  resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have  a material and adverse effect on the results of operations  or the financial position of the Company.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true  and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group in  accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section  133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (particularly Accounting Standard  21, Consolidated Financial Statements).
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group  are responsible for  maintenance of adequate accounting records for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other  irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable  and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively  for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been  used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal  control relevant to the Holding Company’s preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order  to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether the  Holding Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness  of such controls.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the  accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial  statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India: (i)  in the case of the consolidat ed balance sheet, of the state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2015; (ii)  in the case of the consolidat ed statement of profit and loss, of the profit of the Group for the year ended on that date; and (iii)  in the case of the consolidat ed cash flow statement, of the cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.
Emphasis of matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to note 28 to the consolidated financial statements that describes the principles of  Accounting Standard (AS) 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements, applied by the Group on certain foreign currency  borrowing designated as a hedging instrument to hedge its net investment in a non-integral foreign operations, These principles of  AS 30, are yet to be notified under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.
Had the Group  not applied the principles of AS 30, the profit after taxation for the year ended March 31, 2015 would have been lower by ` 390 million.

The financial statements of the  parent company and its majority owned /  controlled subsidiaries have been combined on  a line by line basis by adding together the book  values of all items of assets, liabilities, incomes  and expenses after eliminating all intra-group  balances / transactions and resulting unrealized  gain / loss.
-  The e xcess of the cost to the parent of  its investments in a subsidiary over the  parent’s portion of equity at the date on  which investment in the subsidiary is made,  is recognised as ‘Goodwill’ .
When the cost to  the parent of its investment in a subsidiary is  less than the parent’s portion of equity of the  subsidiary at the date on which investment in  the subsidiary is made, the difference is treated  as ‘Capital Reserve’ in the consolidated financial  statements.
-  Minorit y interest in the net assets of consolidated  subsidiaries consists of:    a)  the amount of equity a ttributable to  the minorities at the dates on which  investment in a subsidiary is made; and    b)  the minorities share of mo vements in  equity since the date of parent-subsidiary  relationship came into existence.
Minorit y interest in share of net result for the  year is identified and adjusted against the profit  after tax.
Excess of loss, if any, attributable to the  minority over and above the minority interest  in the equity of the subsidiaries is absorbed by  the Company.
-  The consolida ted financial statements are  prepared using uniform accounting policies for  similar transactions and other events in similar  circumstances.
iii.
Use of estimates   The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make judgments, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of accounting  policies and the reported amounts of assets and  liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities  as at the date of financial statements and reported  amounts of income and expenses during the year.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis.
Revision to accounting estimates  is recognised in the year in which the estimates are  revised and in any future year affected.
iv.
Fixed asset   Tangible assets are stated at historical cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if  any.
Costs include expenditure directly attributable to  the acquisition of the asset.
Borrowing costs directly  attributable to the construction or production of  qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the cost.
When par ts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted for as  separate items (major components) of property, plant  05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   175 6/21/2015   4:12:47 PM Consolidated Financial Statements 176 Annual Report 2014-15 and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating  to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only  when it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with these will flow to the Company and  the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets are stated at the consideration paid  for acquisition less accumulated amortization and  impairment loss, if any.
Cost of fixed assets not ready for use before the  balance sheet date is disclosed as capital work-in- progress.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of  fixed assets outstanding as of each balance sheet date  is disclosed under long term loans and advances.
v.  Investments   Non -current investments are stated at cost less other  than temporary diminution in the value of such  investments, if any.
Current investments are valued at  lower of cost and fair value determined by category of  investment.
The fair value is determined using quoted  market price/market observable information adjusted  for cost of disposal.
On disposal of the investment,  the difference between its carrying amount and  net disposal proceeds is charged or credited to the  statement of profit and loss.
vi.
Inventories   Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net  realizable value, including necessary provision for  obsolescence.
Cost is determined using the weighted  average method.
Cost of work-in-progress and  finished goods include material cost and appropriate  share of manufacturing overheads.
Cost of inventories  comprises all costs of purchase and other costs  incurred in bringing the inventories to their present  location and condition.
vii.
Provisions and contingent liabilities   Provisions are recognised when the Company has  a present obligation as a result of past events, it is  probable that an outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can  be made of the amount of obligation.
A disclosure for a c ontingent liability is made when  there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of  resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a  present obligation in respect of which the likelihood  of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or  disclosure is made.
Provision for onerous contracts is recognized when  the expected benefits to be derived from the contract  are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting the  future obligations under the contract.
viii.
Revenue recognition   The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware  and related services, business process services, sale  of IT and other products.
Services   The Company recognizes revenue when the significant  terms of the arrangement are enforceable, services have  been delivered and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method for recognizing revenues and costs depends  on the nature of the services rendered:  A.
Time and materials contracts   Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts  are recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts   Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized  using the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage  of completion is determined based on project costs  incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project  costs required to complete the project.
The cost expended  (or input) method has been used to measure progress  towards completion as there is a direct relationship  between input and productivity.
If the Company does  not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress of  completion or to estimate the total contract revenues and  costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent of contract  cost incurred for which recoverability is probable.
When  total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of  profit and loss in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current contract estimates.
Unbilled revenues’ included in other current assets  represent cost and earnings in excess of billings as at the  end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned revenues’ included  in other current liabilities represent billing in excess of  revenue recognized.
Advance payments received from  customers for which no services have been rendered are  presented as ‘Advance from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably  over the period of the contract using the percentage of  completion method.
When services are performed through  an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified  period of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line  basis over the specified period unless some other method  better represents the stage of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units  is agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term.
In such contracts,  revenue is recognized with respect to the actual output  achieved till date as a percentage of total contractual  05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   176 6/21/2015   4:12:47 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Wipro Limited 177 output.
Any residual service unutilized by the customer is  recognized as revenue on completion of the term.
D.  Others  	 •	 The 	Compan y	accoun ts	for	volume	discoun ts	and	 pricing incentives to customers by reducing the  amount of revenue recognized at the time of sale.
•	 The 	Com pany	acc rues	the	est imated	cos t	of	war ranties	 at the time when the revenue is recognized.
The  accruals are based on the Company’s historical  experience of material usage and service delivery  costs.
•	 Costs 	that	relat e	directly	to	a	contr act	and	incurred	 in securing a contract are recognized as an asset and  amortized over the contract term.
•	 Contract 	expenses	are	recog nised	as	expenses	by	 reference to the stage of completion of contract  activity at the end of the reporting period.
Products:  Revenue from sale of products is recognised when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership has been  transferred in accordance with the sales contract.
Revenues  from product sales are shown net of excise duty and net of  sales tax separately charged and applicable discounts.
Other income:  Agency commission is accrued when shipment of  consignment is dispatched by the principal.
Interest is recognized using the time-proportion method,  based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is rec ognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
ix.
Leases  Leases of assets, where the Company assumes substantially  all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as  finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the lower  of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the  present value of minimum lease payments.
Lease payments  are apportioned between the finance charge and the  outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to  periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate  of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Lease rentals in respect of assets taken under operating  leases are charged to profit and loss account on a straight  line basis over the lease term.
In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes  revenue from the sale of products given under finance  leases.
The Company records gross finance receivables,  unearned interest income and the estimated residual  value of the leased equipment on consummation of such  leases.
Unearned interest income represents the excess  of the gross finance lease receivable plus the estimated  residual value over the sales price of the equipment.
The Company recognizes unearned interest income as  financing revenue over the lease term using the effective  interest method.
x.
Foreign currency transactions  Transaction:  The Company is exposed to currency fluctuations on foreign  currency transactions.
Foreign currency transactions are  accounted at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of  transaction.
Translation:  Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities at period- end are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the  date of Balance Sheet.
The difference arising from the  translation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss,  except for the exchange difference arising on monetary  items that qualify as hedging instruments in a cash flow  hedge or hedge of a net investment in a non-integral  foreign operation.
In such cases the exchange difference is  initially recognised in hedging reserve or Foreign Currency  Translation Reserve (FCTR), respectively.
Such exchange  differences are subsequently recognised in the statement  of profit and loss on occurrence of the underlying  hedged transaction or on disposal of the investment,  respectively.
Further, foreign currency differences arising  from translation of intercompany receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, the settlement of which  is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future,  are considered to form part of net investment in foreign  operation and are recognized in FCTR.
When a foreign  operation is disposed of, the relevant amount recognized  in FCTR is transferred to the statement of profit and loss as  part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Integral operations:  Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing at the date of the balance sheet.
Non-monetary items are translated at the historical rate.
The items in the statement of profit and loss are translated  at the average exchange rate during the period.
The  differences arising out of the translation are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss.
Non-integral operations:  Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing at the date of the balance sheet.
The items in the  statement of profit and loss are translated at the average  exchange rate during the period.
The differences arising  out of the translation are transferred to foreign currency  translation reserve.
05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   177 6/21/2015   4:12:47 PM Consolidated Financial Statements 178 Annual Report 2014-15   The amended AS 11 provides an irrevocable option to  the Company to amortise exchange rate fluctuation  on long term foreign currency monetary asset/liability  over the life of the asset/liability or March 31, 2020,  whichever is earlier.
The amendment is applicable  retroactively from the financial year beginning on or  after December 7, 2006.
The company did not elect to exercise the option.
xi.
Financial Instruments   Financial instruments are recognised when the  Company becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the instrument.
Derivative instruments and Hedge accounting:  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  on foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in  non-integral foreign operations and forecasted cash flows  denominated in foreign currency.
The Company limits the  effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by following  established risk management policies including the use of  derivatives.
The Company enters into derivative financial  instruments, where the counterparty is primarily a bank.
Premium or discount on foreign exchange forward  contracts entered into hedge foreign currency risk of an  existing asset / liability is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss over the period of the contract.
Exchange  differences on such contracts are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss of the reporting period in which  the exchange rates change.
The Company has adopted the principles of Accounting  Standard 30, Financial Instruments: Recognition and  Measurement (AS 30) issued by ICAI except to the  extent the adoption of AS 30 does not conflict with  existing accounting standards prescribed by Companies  (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2014 and other authoritative  pronouncements.
In accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles set out in AS 30, changes in fair value of derivative  financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are  recognised directly in Reserves and Surplus and reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss upon the occurrence  of the hedged transaction.
The Company designates derivative financial instruments  as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging  instruments and gains/losses on translation or settlement  of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated  as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations are  recognized in Reserves and Surplus to the extent that  the hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is  ineffective, changes in fair value are recognized in the  statement of profit and loss.
Changes in fair value rela ting to the ineffective portion of  the hedges and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge  accounting are recognised in the statement of profit and  loss.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is  determined based on observable market inputs including  currency spot and forward rates, yield curves, currency  volatility etc.
xii.
Depreciation and amortization   The Company has provided for depreciation using  straight line method over the useful life of the assets  as prescribed under part C of Schedule II of the  Companies Act, 2013 except in the case of following  assets which are depreciated based on useful lives  estimated by the Management: Class of asset Estimated   Useful Life  Building 28-40 years Plant and machinery 5 – 21 years Office equipment 3 - 10 years Vehicles 4 - 5  years Furniture and fixtures 3 - 10 years Electrical installations (included  under plant and machinery)2-7 years Computer equipment and  software (included under plant  and machinery)2 – 7 years  For the class of assets, based on internal technical  assessment, management believes that the useful lives as  given above best represent the period over which assets  are expected to be used.
Hence the useful lives for these assets are different from  the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II  of the Companies Act, 2013.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Fixed assets individually costing Rupees five thousand or  less are depreciated at 100% over a period of one year.
Assets under finance lease are amortised over their  estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is lower.
Payments for leasehold land are amortised over the period  of lease.
The estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible  assets for the current and comparative periods are as  follows:  Class of asset Estimated   Useful Life  Customer-related intangibles 5-10 years 05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   178 6/21/2015   4:12:47 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Wipro Limited 179  xiii.
Impairment of assets   Financial assets:   The Company assesses at each period end whether  there is any objective evidence that a financial asset  or group of financial assets is impaired.
If any such  indication exists, the Company estimates the amount  of impairment loss.
The amount of loss for receivables  is measured as the difference between the assets  carrying amount and undiscounted amount of future  cash flows.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
If at the balance sheet  date there is any indication that a previously assessed  impairment loss no longer exists, the recognised  impairment loss is reversed, subject to maximum of  initial carrying amount of the short-term receivable.
Other than financial assets:    The Company assesses at each period end whether  there is any indication that a non-financial asset  including goodwill may be impaired.
If any such  indication exists, the Company estimates the  recoverable amount of the asset.
If such recoverable  amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit to which the asset belongs to is  less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is  reduced to its recoverable amount.
The reduction is  treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
If at the balance sheet  date there is an indication that a previously assessed  impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable  amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at  the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of  depreciated historical cost.
In respect of goodwill,  the impairment loss will be reversed only when it was  caused by specific external events of an exceptional  nature that is not expected to recur and their effects  have been reversed by subsequent external events.
xiv.
Employee benefits   Provident fund:    Employees r eceive benefits from a provident fund,  a defined benefit plan.
The employee and employer  each make monthly contributions to the plan.
A  portion of the contribution is made to the approved  provident fund trust managed by the Company,  while the remainder of the contribution is made to  the government administered pension fund.
The  Company is generally liable for any shortfall in the  fund assets based on the government specified  minimum rate of return.
Compensated absences:   The employees of the Company are entitled to  compensated absences.
The employees can carry  forward a portion of the unutilized accumulating  compensated absences and utilize it in future  periods or receive cash at retirement or termination  of employment.
The Company records an obligation  for compensated absences in the period in which  the employee renders the services that increases this  entitlement.
The Company measures the expected  cost of compensated absences as the additional  amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of  the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the  end of the reporting period.
The Company recognizes  accumulated compensated absences based on  actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit  method.
Non-accumulating compensated absences  are recognized in the period in which the absences  occur.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains and  losses immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

The  compensation cost is amortised on a straight line  basis over the vesting period.
xvi.
Taxes   Income tax:   The current charge for income taxes is calculated  in accordance with the relevant tax regulations.
Tax  liability for domestic taxes has been computed under  Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).
MAT credit are being  recognized if there is convincing evidence that the  Company will pay normal tax after the tax holiday  period and the resultant asset can be measured  05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   179 6/21/2015   4:12:47 PM Consolidated Financial Statements 180 Annual Report 2014-15 reliably.
The excess tax paid under MAT provisions  being over and above regular tax liability can be  carried forward for a period of ten years from the year  of recognition and is available for set off against future  tax liabilities computed under regular tax provisions,  to the extent of MAT liability.
Deferred tax:   Defer red tax assets and liabilities are recognised for  the future tax consequences attributable to timing  differences that result between the profit offered  for income taxes and the profit as per the financial  statements of each entity in the Group.
Defer red taxes are recognised in respect of timing  differences which originate during the tax holiday  period but reverse after the tax holiday period.
For this  purpose, reversal of timing difference is determined  using first in first out method.
Def erred tax assets and liabilities are measured using  the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The  effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change  in tax rates is recognised in the period that includes  the enactment/substantive enactment date.
Defer red tax assets on timing differences are  recognised only if there is a reasonable certainty  that sufficient future taxable income will be available  against which such deferred tax assets can be realized.
However, deferred tax assets on the timing differences  when unabsorbed depreciation and losses carried  forward exist, are recognised only to the extent that  there is virtual certainty that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred  tax assets can be realized.
Defer red tax assets are reassessed for the  appropriateness of their respective carrying amounts  at each balance sheet date.
The Company offsets, on a year on year basis, it’s  current and non-current tax assets and liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right and where it  intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net  basis.
xvii.
Earnings per share    Basic:    The number of equity shares used in computing basic  earnings per share is the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year excluding equity  shares held by controlled trust.
Diluted:    The number of equity shares used in computing  diluted earnings per share comprises the weighted  average number of equity shares considered for  deriving basic earnings per share, and also the  weighted average number of equity shares that could  have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive  potential equity shares.
Dilutive poten tial equity shares are deemed converted  as of the beginning of the period, unless issued  at a later date.
The number of equity shares and  potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted for any  stock splits and bonus shares issued.
xviii.
Cash flow statement   Cash flows are reported using the indirect method,  whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any  deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts  or payments.

Adoption of AS 30  The Company has applied the principles of AS 30, as per  announcement by ICAI, to the extent such principles of AS  30 does not conflict with existing accounting standards  prescribed by Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014.   i)  As permitt ed by AS 30, the Company has designated  a USD-denominated foreign currency borrowing  amounting to USD 150 million as a hedging  instrument to hedge its net investment in a non- integral foreign operation.
ii)  Acc ordingly, the translation gain/ (loss) on the foreign  currency borrowings and portion of the changes in  fair value of IRS which are determined to be effective  hedge of net investment in non-integral operation  and cash flow hedge of foreign currency borrowings  aggregating to ` (524) for the year ended March 31,  2015 [2014: ` (705)] was recognised in translation  reserve / hedging reserve in shareholders’ funds.
The amount of gain/ (loss) of ` (390) for the year  ended March 31, 2015 [2014: ` (839)] recognised  in translation reserve would be transferred to profit  and loss account upon sale or disposal of the non- integral foreign operation and the amount of gain /  (loss) of ` (134) for year ended March 31, 2015 [2014:  ` 134] recognised in the hedging reserve would be  transferred to the statement of profit and loss on the  occurrence of the hedged transaction.
iii)  In accordance with AS 11, if the Company had  continued to recognize translation (losses)/ gains on  foreign currency borrowing in the statement of profit  and loss: 05_Wipro AR_Consolidated Accnts_2015.indd   191 6/21/2015   4:12:49 PM Consolidated Financial Statements 192 Annual Report 2014-15   a.  Foreig n currency borrowing of USD 150 Mn  would not have been eligible as a hedge  instrument for hedge accounting and changes in  the fair value of the foreign currency borrowing  would have to be recognized in the statement of  profit and loss.
As a result profit after tax would  have been lower by ` 390 for the year ended  March 31, 2015 (2014: ` 839).

For the years ended March 31, 2008, March 2009, the  appeals are pending before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal  (Tribunal).
For year ended March 31, 2010, the Dispute Resolution  Panel (DRP) allowed the claim of the Company under  section 10A of the Act.
The Income tax authorities have  filed an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March 31, 2011, the Company received the  draft assessment order in March 2015, on similar grounds  as that of earlier years, with a demand of ` 7,852 (including  interest of ` 2,547) for the financial year ended March 31,  2011.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the  order of the Appellate authority/Hon’ble Karnataka High  Court upholding the claims of the Company for earlier  years, the Company believes that the final outcome of the  above disputes should be in favor of the Company and  there should not be any adverse impact on the financial  statements.

These consolidated financial statements are the  responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements  based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements  are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of the Company as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three year period ended March 31, 2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by International  Accounting Standard Board.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Wipro  Limited’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated  Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated  May 23, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company overview  Wipro Limited (“Wipro” or the “Parent Company”), together with  its subsidiaries (collectively, “the Company” or the “Group”) is a  leading India based provider of IT Services, including Business  Process Services (“BPS”), globally.
Effective as of March  31, 2013, the Group completed the  demerger (the “Demerger”) of its consumer care and lighting,  infrastructure engineering and other non-IT business segments  (collectively, the “Diversified Business”) into Wipro Enterprises  Limited (“Resulting Company”), a company incorporated  under the laws of India.
The Diversified Business is presented  as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated  financial statements.
See Note 4 of these Consolidated Financial  Statements for more information regarding the Demerger.
Wipro is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in India.
The address of its registered office is Wipro Limited,  Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bangalore – 560 035, Karnataka,  India.
Wipro has its primary listing with Bombay Stock Exchange  and National Stock Exchange in India.
The Company’s American  Depository Shares representing equity shares are also listed  on the New York Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial  statements were authorized for issue by the Audit Committee  on May 23, 2015.
2.
Basis of preparation of financial statements  (i)  Statement of compliance and basis of preparation  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  and its interpretations (“IFRS”), as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
Accounting policies have  been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements correspond to the  classification provisions contained in IAS 1 (revised), “Presentation  of Financial Statements”.
For clarity, various items are aggregated  in the statements of income and statements of financial position.
These items are disaggregated separately in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements, where applicable.
All amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  are reported in millions of Indian rupees (Rupees in millions)  except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated.
Due to  rounding off, the numbers presented throughout the document  may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not  precisely reflect the absolute figures.
(ii)  Basis of measurement  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for  the following material items which have been measured at fair  value as required by relevant IFRS:-  a.
Derivative financial instruments;  b.  Available-for-sale financial assets; and  c.  The defined benefit asset/(liability) is recognised as the  present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value  of plan assets.
(iii)  Convenience translation (unaudited)  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been  prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the national currency of  India.
Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated  financial statements as of and for the year ended March  31,  2015, have been translated into United States dollars at the  certified foreign exchange rate of US$1 = ` 62.31, as published  by Federal Reserve Board of Governors on March 31, 2015.
No  representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have  been, could have been or could be converted into United States  dollars at such a rate or any other rate.
(iv)  Use of estimates and judgment  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in  conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that affect the application of  accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from  those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an  ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized  in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future  periods affected.
In particular, information about significant  areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in  applying accounting policies that have the most significant  effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial  statements are included in the following notes:  a)  Revenue recognition:  The Company uses the percentage of  completion method using the input (cost expended) method to  measure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price  contracts.
Percentage of completion method accounting relies  on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs.
This  method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates  of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of  the contract can be made.
Key factors that are reviewed in  estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of  future labor costs and productivity efficiencies.
Because the  financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts,  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   218 6/21/2015   4:10:14 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 219 contract progresses to completion.
When estimates indicate  that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period  in which the loss becomes probable.
b)  Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate  that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is  less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of cash  generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost  to sell.
The calculation involves use of significant estimates and  assumptions which includes turnover and earnings multiples,  growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future  cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and  market conditions.
c)  Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company  are India and the United States of America.
Significant judgments  are involved in determining the provision for income taxes  including judgment on whether tax positions are probable of  being sustained in tax assessments.
A tax assessment can involve  complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time  periods.
d)  Deferred taxes:  Deferred tax is recorded on temporary  differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted  or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The ultimate  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the  generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which  those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become  deductible.
The Company considers the expected reversal of  deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in  making this assessment.
The amount of the deferred income  tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in  the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the  carry-forward period are reduced.
e)  Business combination:  In accounting for business  combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an  identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from  goodwill.
Additionally, estimating the acquisition date fair value  of the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent  consideration assumed involves management judgment.
These measurements are based on information available at the  acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions  that have been deemed reasonable by management.
Changes  in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially  affect the results of operations.
f )  Other estimates: The preparation of financial statements  involves estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities  at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of  revenues and expenses for the reporting period.
Specifically, the  Company estimates the uncollectability of accounts receivable by  analyzing historical payment patterns, customer concentrations,  customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends.
If  the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, additional  allowances may be required.
Similarly, the Company provides  for inventory obsolescence, excess inventory and inventories  with carrying values in excess of net realizable value based  on assessment of the future demand, market conditions and  specific inventory management initiatives.
If market conditions  and actual demands are less favorable than the Company’s  estimates, additional inventory provisions may be required.
In all  cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost and net  realizable value.
The stock compensation expense is determined  based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will  eventually vest.
Non-marketable equity investments are initially recorded  at cost and subsequently measured at fair value.
Fair value  of investments is determined using the market and income  approaches.
The market approach includes the use of financial  metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as revenue,  earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financial  rounds and the level of marketability of the investments.
The  selection of comparable companies requires management  judgment and is based on a number of factors, including  comparable company sizes, growth rates, and development  stages.
The income approach includes the use of discounted  cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding  the investees’ revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the  risk profile of comparable companies.
Estimates of revenue and  costs are developed using available historical and forecast data.
3.
Significant ac counting policies  (i)  Basis of consolidation  Subsidiaries  The Company determines the basis of control in line with the  requirements of IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The Group  controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to affect those returns through its power over the  entity.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in  the consolidated financial statements from the date on which  control commences until the date on which control ceases.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.
Equity accounted investees  Equity accounted investees are entities in respect of which  the Company has significant influence, but not control, over  the financial and operating policies.
Interest in associates is  accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity  method, the investment is initially recorded at cost.
Subsequent  to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements  include the Company’s share of the profit or loss and other  comprehensive income (“OCI”) of equity accounted investees,  until the date on which significant influence ceases.
06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   219 6/21/2015   4:10:14 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 220 Annual Report 2014-15 Non-controlling interest  Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill)  of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the  Company’s equity.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders  may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non- controlling interest’s proportionate share of the fair value of the  acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement  basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis.
Subsequent  to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interest  is the amount of those interest at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling  interests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having  a deficit balance.
(ii)  Functional and presentation currency  Items included in the financial statements of each of the  Company’s entities (including equity accounted investees)  are measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which these entities operate (i.e.
the “functional  currency”).
These consolidated financial statements are  presented in Indian rupees, the national currency of India, which  is the functional currency of the Company.
(iii)  Foreign currency transactions and translation  a)  Transactions and balances  Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the  respective functional currencies using the exchange rates  prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains  and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions  and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the  reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results of operating activities except when deferred in other  comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedge and  qualifying net investment hedges.
Gains/(losses) relating to  translation or settlement of borrowings denominated in foreign  currency are reported within finance expense except foreign  exchange gains/(losses) on short-term borrowings, which are  considered as a natural economic hedge for the foreign currency  monetary assets and are classified and reported within foreign  exchange gains/(losses), net within results from operating  activities.
Non monetary assets and liabilities denominated in  foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated  at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets  measured at fair value such as equities classified as available for  sale are included in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
b)  Foreign operations  For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements,  the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations  that have a functional currency other than Indian rupees are  translated into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing at  the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at  the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences  arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income  and held in foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a  component of equity.
When a foreign operation is disposed off,  the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred to the  statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the  foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate prevailing  at the reporting date.
c)  Others  Foreign currency differences arising on the translation or  settlement of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a  net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in other  comprehensive income and presented within equity in the FCTR  to the extent the hedge is effective.
To the extent the hedge is  ineffective, such differences are recognized in the statement of  income.
When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed  off, the relevant amount recognized in FCTR is transferred  to the statement of income as part of the profit or loss on  disposal.
Foreign currency differences arising from translation  of intercompany receivables or payables relating to foreign  operations, the settlement of which is neither planned nor  likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of  net investment in foreign operation and are recognized in FCTR.
(iv)  Financial instruments  a)  Non-derivative financial instruments  Non derivative financial instruments consist of:  •	 financial 	assets,	which	include	cash	and	cash	equivalents ,	 trade receivables, unbilled revenues, finance lease  receivables, employee and other advances, investments  in equity and debt securities and eligible current and non- current assets;  •	 financial 	liabilities,	which	include	long	and	short-t erm	loans	 and borrowings, bank overdrafts, trade payables, eligible  current and non-current liabilities.
Non derivative financial instruments are recognized initially  at fair value including any directly attributable transaction  costs.
Financial assets are derecognized when substantial risks  and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been  transferred.
In cases where substantial risks and rewards of  ownership of the financial assets are neither transferred nor  retained, financial assets are derecognized only when the  Company has not retained control over the financial asset.
Subsequent to initial recognition, non derivative financial  instruments are measured as described below:  A.
Cash and cash equivalents  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on  hand and in banks and demand deposits with banks, which  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   220 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 221 can be withdrawn at any time, without prior notice or penalty  on the principal.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash  equivalents include cash on hand, in banks and demand deposits  with banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts that are repayable  on demand and are considered part of the Company’s cash  management system.
In the consolidated statement of financial  position, bank overdrafts are presented under borrowings within  current liabilities.
B.  Available-for-sale financial assets  The Company has classified investments in liquid mutual funds,  equity securities (other than equity accounted investees) and  certain debt securities (primarily certificate of deposits with  banks) as available-for-sale financial assets.
These investments  are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than  impairment losses, are recognized in other comprehensive  income and presented within equity, net of taxes.
The  impairment losses, if any, are reclassified from equity into  statement of income.
When an available for sale financial asset  is derecognized, the related cumulative gain or loss recognised  in equity is transferred to the statement of income.
C.  Loans and receivables  Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with  fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an  active market.
They are presented as current assets, except  for those maturing later than 12 months after the reporting  date which are presented as non-current assets.
Loans and  receivables are initially recognized at fair value plus directly  attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured  at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less  any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise trade  receivables, unbilled revenues, cash and cash equivalents  and other assets.
D.  Trade and other payables  Trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value,  and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective  interest method.
For these financial instruments, the carrying  amounts approximate fair value due to the short term maturity  of these instruments.
b)  Derivative financial instruments  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on  foreign currency assets, liabilities, net investment in foreign  operations and forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign  currency.
The Company limits the effect of foreign exchange rate  fluctuations by following established risk management policies  including the use of derivatives.
The Company enters into  derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is  primarily a bank.
Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value.
Attributable transaction costs are recognized in statement of  income as cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments  are measured as described below:  A.
Cash flow hedges  Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument  designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in other  comprehensive income and held in cash flow hedging reserve,  net of taxes, a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge  is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in  fair value are recognized in the statement of income and reported  within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within results from  operating activities.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets  the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively.
If the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss  on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging  reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash  flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash  flow hedging reserve is transferred to the statement of income  upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction.
If  the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, such  cumulative balance is immediately recognized in the statement  of income.
B.  Hedges of net investmen t in foreign operations  The Company designates derivative financial instruments as  hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Company  has also designated a combination of foreign currency  denominated borrowings and related cross-currency swaps as  a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
Changes in the  fair value of the derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses  on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated  borrowings designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign  operations are recognized in other comprehensive income  and presented within equity in the FCTR to the extent that the  hedge is effective.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective,  changes in fair value are recognized in the statement of income  and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net within  results from operating activities.
C.  Others  Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  neither designated as cash flow hedges nor hedges of net  investment in foreign operations are recognized in the statement  of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses),  net within results from operating activities.
Changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign  currency derivative instruments relating to borrowings, which  have not been designated as hedges are recorded in finance  expense.
06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   221 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 222 Annual Report 2014-15 (v)  Equity and share capital  a)  Share capital and share premium  The authorized share capital of the Company is ` 6,100,000,000  divided into 2,917,500,000 equity shares of `  2 each, 25,000,000  preference shares of ` 10 each and 150,000 10% optionally  convertible cumulative preference shares of ` 100 each.
Par  value of the equity shares is recorded as share capital and the  amount received in excess of par value is classified as share  premium.
Every holder of the equity shares, as reflected in the records of the  Company as of the date of the shareholder meeting shall have  one vote in respect of each share held for all matters submitted  to vote in the shareholder meeting.
b)  Shares held by controlled trust (Treasury shares)  The Company’s equity shares held by the controlled trust, which  is consolidated as a part of the Group are classified as Treasury  shares.
The Company has 14,841,271, 16,640,212 and 14,829,824  treasury shares as of March 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Treasury shares are recorded at acquisition cost.
c)  Retained earnings  Retained earnings comprises of the Company’s undistributed  earnings after taxes.
A portion of these earnings amounting to  ` 1,139 is not freely available for distribution.
d)  Share based payment reserve  The share based payment reserve is used to record the value  of equity-settled share based payment transactions with  employees.
The amounts recorded in share based payment  reserve are transferred to share premium upon exercise of stock  options by employees.
e)  Cash flow hedging reserve  Changes in fair value of derivative hedging instruments  designated and effective as a cash flow hedge are recognized  in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and presented  within equity in the cash flow hedging reserve.
f)  Foreign currency translation reserve  The exchange differences arising from the translation of financial  statements of foreign subsidiaries, differences arising from  translation of long-term intercompany receivables or payables  relating to foreign operations, changes in fair value of the  derivative hedging instruments and gains/losses on translation  or settlement of foreign currency denominated borrowings  designated as hedge of net investment in foreign operations  are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and  presented within equity in the FCTR.
g)  Other reserves  Changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets is  recognized in other comprehensive income (net of taxes), and  presented within equity in other reserves.
h)  Dividend  A final dividend, including tax thereon, on common stock  is recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the  shareholders.
An interim dividend, including tax thereon, is  recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the board  of directors.
(vi)  Property, plant and equipment  a)  Recognition and measurement  Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Cost  includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of  the asset.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction  of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost.
b)  Depreciation  The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over  the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis from the date  the assets are available for use.
Assets acquired under finance  lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the  shorter of estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease  term.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful  life of assets are reviewed and where appropriate are adjusted,  annually.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:  Category Useful life   Buildings 28 to 40 years Plant and machinery 5 to 21 years Computer, equipment and software 2 to 7 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 10 years Vehicles 4 to 5 years When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate  items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and  equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with these will flow to the  Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Deposits and advances paid towards the acquisition of property,  plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date and  the cost of property, plant and equipment not available for use  before such date are disclosed under capital work- in-progress.
(vii)  Business combination, Goodwill and Intangible assets  a)  Business combination  Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase  (acquisition) method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured  as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or  assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange  by the Company.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination  are measured initially at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business  acquisition are expensed as incurred.
06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   222 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 223 The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any  contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition.
Any subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent  consideration classified as liabilities, other than measurement  period adjustments, are recognized in the consolidated  statement of income.
b)  Goodwill  The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Company’s share  in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and  contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill.
If the excess is  negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in  the statement of income.
c)  Intangible assets  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost of  acquisition.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination  are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Following  initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less  accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.
The amortization of an intangible asset with a finite useful life  reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected  to be generated and consumed.
Intangible assets with indefinite  lives comprising of brands are not amortized, but instead  tested for impairment at least annually and written down to the  recoverable amount as required.
The estimated useful life of amortizable intangibles are reviewed  and where appropriate are adjusted, annually.
The estimated  useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current  and comparative periods are as follows:  Category Useful life  Customer-related intangibles 5 to 10 years Marketing related intangibles 5 to 10 years (viii)   Leases  The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains,  a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the  inception date.
The arrangement is, or contains a lease if,  fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a  specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to  use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified  in an arrangement.
a)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessee  Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the Company  assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are  classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalized at the  lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present  value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are  apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding  liability.
The finance charge is allocated to periods during the  lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining  balance of the liability.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments  made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of  income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
b)  Arrangements where the Company is the lessor  In certain arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue  from the sale of products given under finance leases.
The  Company records gross finance receivables, unearned income  and the estimated residual value of the leased equipment on  consummation of such leases.
Unearned income represents the  excess of the gross finance lease receivable plus the estimated  residual value over the sales price of the equipment.
The  Company recognizes unearned income as financing revenue  over the lease term using the effective interest method.
(ix)  Inventories  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realizable  value, including necessary provision for obsolescence.
Cost is  determined using the weighted average method.
(x)  Impairment  a)  Financial assets  The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there  is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired.
If any such indication exists, the  Company estimates the amount of impairment loss.
A.
Loans and receivables  Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized  using separate allowance accounts.
Refer Note 2 (iv) (f ) for further  information regarding the determination of impairment.
B.
Available for sale financial assets  When the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets declines  below acquisition cost and there is objective evidence that  the asset is impaired, the cumulative gain/loss that has been  recognized in other comprehensive income, a component of  equity in other reserves is transferred to the statement of income.
An impairment loss may be reversed in subsequent periods, if  the indicators for the impairment no longer exist.
Such reversals  are recognized in other comprehensive income.
b)  Non financial assets  The Company assesses long-lived assets such as property, plant,  equipment and acquired intangible assets for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not  be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the Company  estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group of  assets.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating  unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) and  its value-in-use (VIU).
If the recoverable amount of the asset  or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to  which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the  carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The  reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized  in the statement of income.
If at the reporting date, there is an  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   223 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 224 Annual Report 2014-15 indication that a previously assessed impairment loss no longer  exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the impairment  losses previously recognized are reversed such that the asset is  recognized at its recoverable amount but not exceeding written  down value which would have been reported if the impairment  losses had not been recognized initially.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives comprising of brands  are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least  annually at the same time and written down to the recoverable  amount as required.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the same  time and when events occur or changes in circumstances  indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating  unit is less than its carrying value.
The goodwill impairment test  is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of  cash-generating units which represent the lowest level at which  goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
An  impairment in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
(xi)  Employee benefits  a)  Post-employment and pension plans  The Group participates in various employee benefit plans.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as  either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.
Under  a defined contribution plan, the Company’s only obligation  is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further  contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay  all employee benefits.
The related actuarial and investment risks  fall on the employee.
The expenditure for defined contribution  plans is recognized as an expense during the period when the  employee provides service.
Under a defined benefit plan, it is  the Company’s obligation to provide agreed benefits to the  employees.
The related actuarial and investment risks fall on the  Company.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations  is calculated by an independent actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
During the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company had applied  IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) Employee Benefits and the  related consequential amendments.
IAS 19R has been applied  retrospectively in accordance with transitional provisions.
As a  result, all actuarial gains or losses are immediately recognized  in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and permanently  excluded from profit or loss.
Further, the profit or loss will no  longer include an expected return on plan assets.
Instead net  interest recognized in profit or loss is calculated by applying the  discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to  the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The actual return on the  plan assets above or below the discount rate is recognized as  part of re-measurement of net defined liability or asset through  other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
The adoption of  IAS 19R did not have a material impact on the consolidated  financial statements.
Also, the comparative information has  not been restated as the cumulative effect of the change in  the accounting policy is inconsequential to the consolidated  financial statements.
The Company has the following employee benefit plans:  A.  Provident fund  Employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a  defined benefit plan.
The employer and employees each make  periodic contributions to the plan.
A portion of the contribution  is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the  Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to  the government administered pension fund.
The Company is  generally liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the  government specified minimum rates of return.
B.  Superannuation  Superannuation plan, a defined contribution scheme is  administered by Life Insurance Corporation of India and ICICI  Prudential Insurance Company Limited.
The Company makes  annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each  eligible employee’s salary.
C.  Gratuity  In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, applicable  for Indian companies, the Company provides for a lump sum  payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination  of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of  employment with the Company.
The gratuity fund is managed  by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), HDFC Standard  Life, TATA AIG and Birla Sun-life.
The Company’s obligation in  respect of the gratuity plan, which is a defined benefit plan, is  provided for based on actuarial valuation using the projected  unit credit method.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains and  losses immediately in other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
b)  Termination benefits  Termination benefits are expensed when the Company can no  longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.
c)  Short-term benefits  Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an  undiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as the related  service is provided.
A liability is recognized for the amount  expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit- sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or constructive  obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided  by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
d)  Compensated absences  The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated  absences.
The employees can carry forward a portion of the  unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it  in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination  of employment.
The Company records an obligation for  compensated absences in the period in which the employee  renders the services that increases this entitlement.
The  Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences  as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a  result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   224 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 225 of the reporting period.
The Company recognizes accumulated  compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the  projected unit credit method.
Non-accumulating compensated  absences are recognized in the period in which the absences  occur.
The Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses  immediately in the statement of income.
(xii)  Share based payment transactions  Selected employees of the Company receive remuneration in  the form of equity settled instruments, for rendering services  over a defined vesting period.
Equity instruments granted are  measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the  date of grant.
In cases, where equity instruments are granted at  a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant  approximates the fair value.
The expense is recognized in the  statement of income with a corresponding increase to the share  based payment reserve, a component of equity.
The equity instruments generally vest in a graded manner over  the vesting period.
The fair value determined at the grant date is  expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of  such grants (accelerated amortization).
The stock compensation  expense is determined based on the Company’s estimate of  equity instruments that will eventually vest.
(xiii)   Provisions  Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present  obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required  to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of  the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of  the consideration required to settle the present obligation at  the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks  and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a  provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the  receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that  reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable  can be measured reliably.
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the  expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a  contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the  future obligations under the contract.
Provisions for onerous  contracts are measured at the present value of lower of the  expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected  cost of terminating the contract.
(xiv) Revenue  The Company derives revenue primarily from software  development, maintenance of software/hardware and related  services, business process services, sale of IT and other products.
a)  Services  The Company recognizes revenue when the significant terms of  the arrangement are enforceable, services have been delivered  and the collectability is reasonably assured.
The method for  recognizing revenues and costs depends on the nature of the  services rendered:  A.
Time and materials contracts  Revenues and costs relating to time and materials contracts are  recognized as the related services are rendered.
B.  Fixed-price contracts  Revenues from fixed-price contracts, including systems  development and integration contracts are recognized using  the “percentage-of-completion” method.
Percentage of  completion is determined based on project costs incurred to  date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required  to complete the project.
The cost expended (or input) method  has been used to measure progress towards completion as  there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
If the Company does not have a sufficient basis to measure  the progress of completion or to estimate the total contract  revenues and costs, revenue is recognized only to the extent  of contract cost incurred for which recoverability is probable.
When total cost estimates exceed revenues in an arrangement,  the estimated losses are recognized in the statement of income  in the period in which such losses become probable based on  the current contract estimates.
‘Unbilled revenues’ represent cost and earnings in excess of  billings as at the end of the reporting period.
‘Unearned revenues’  represent billing in excess of revenue recognized.
Advance  payments received from customers for which no services have  been rendered are presented as ‘Advance from customers’ .
C.  Maintenance contracts  Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over  the period of the contract using the percentage of completion  method.
When services are performed through an indefinite  number of repetitive acts over a specified period of time,  revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the specified  period unless some other method better represents the stage  of completion.
In certain projects, a fixed quantum of service or output units is  agreed at a fixed price for a fixed term.
In such contracts, revenue  is recognized with respect to the actual output achieved till  date as a percentage of total contractual output.
Any residual  service unutilized by the customer is recognized as revenue on  completion of the term.
b)  Products  Revenue from products are recognized when the significant  risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer,  continuing managerial involvement usually associated with  ownership and effective control have ceased, the amount of  revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic  benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company  and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the  transaction can be measured reliably.
06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   225 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 226 Annual Report 2014-15 c)  Multiple element arrangements  Revenue from contracts with multiple-element arrangements  are recognized using the guidance in IAS 18, Revenue.
The  Company allocates the arrangement consideration to separately  identifiable components based on their relative fair values  or on the residual method.
Fair values are determined based  on sale prices for the components when it is regularly sold  separately, third-party prices for similar components or cost  plus an appropriate business-specific profit margin related to  the relevant component.
d)  Others  •		 The 	Company	accoun ts	for	volume	discounts	and	pricing	 incentives to customers by reducing the amount of revenue  recognized at the time of sale.
•		 Revenues 	are	shown	net	of	sales	tax,	value	added	tax,	 service tax and applicable discounts and allowances.
Revenue includes excise duty.
•		 The 	Company	accrues	the	estimated	cost	of	warr anties	at	 the time when the revenue is recognized.
The accruals are  based on the Company’s historical experience of material  usage and service delivery costs.
•	 Costs 	that	relat e	directly 	to	a	contr act	and	incurred	 in securing a contract are recognized as an asset and  amortized over the contract term.
•		 Contract 	expenses	are	recog nised	as	expenses	by	refer ence	 to the stage of completion of contract activity at the end  of the reporting period.
(xv)  Finance expenses  Finance expenses comprise interest cost on borrowings,  impairment losses recognized on financial assets, gains/ (losses)  on translation or settlement of foreign currency borrowings  and changes in fair value and gains/ (losses) on settlement of  related derivative instruments except foreign exchange gains/ (losses), net on short-term borrowings which are considered as  a natural economic hedge for the foreign currency monetary  assets which are classified as foreign exchange gains/(losses),  net within results from operating activities.
Borrowing costs that  are not directly attributable to a qualifying asset are recognized  in the statement of income using the effective interest method.
(xvi) Finance and other income  Finance and other income comprises interest income on  deposits, dividend income and gains / (losses) on disposal of  available-for-sale financial assets.
Interest income is recognized  using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is  recognized when the right to receive payment is established.
(xvii) Income tax  Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax  expense is recognized in the statement of income except to  the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly  recognized in equity or in other comprehensive income.
a)  Current income tax  Current income tax for the current and prior periods are  measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or  paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income  for the period.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the  current tax amount are those that are enacted or substantively  enacted by the reporting date and applicable for the period.
The  Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized  amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or  to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.
b)  Deferred income tax  Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet  approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are  recognized for deductible and taxable temporary differences  arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amount in financial statements, except when  the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of  goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable  profits or loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent it is  probable that taxable profit will be available against which  the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of  unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates  and foreign branches where the timing of the reversal of the  temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the  temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed  at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to  allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset  is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax  laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date.
The Company offsets deferred income tax assets and liabilities,  where it has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets  against current tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by  the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity, or  on different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle  the current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax  assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.
(xviii) Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average  number of equity shares outstanding during the period adjusted  for treasury shares held.
Diluted earnings per share is computed  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   226 6/21/2015   4:10:15 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 227 using the weighted-average number of equity and dilutive  equivalent shares outstanding during the period, using the  treasury stock method for options and warrants, except where  the results would be anti-dilutive.
(xix) Discontinued operations  A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’s  business that represents a separate line of business that has  been disposed off or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired  exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued  operation occurs upon the earlier of disposal or when the  operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
A demerger that is a business under common control is outside  the scope of IFRS 3, Business Combination and IFRIC 17, Non- Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and  can be accounted using either carrying values or fair values.
The Company accounts for such demergers at carrying value.
New Accounting standards adopted by the Company:  The Company has, with effect from April  01, 2014, adopted  the following interpretation and amendments to accounting  standards.
IFRIC 21 – Levies  IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  January 1, 2014 and is applied retrospectively.
It is applicable  to all levies imposed by governments under legislation, other  than outflows that are within the scope of other standards (e.g.,  IAS 12 Income Taxes) and fines or other penalties for breaches  of legislation.
The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognizes a liability  when the activity that triggers the payment of levy, as identified  by the relevant legislation, occurs.
No liability needs to be  recorded towards levy that will be triggered by operating in  a future period.
It also clarifies that a levy liability is accrued  progressively only if the activity that triggers payment occurs  over a period of time, in accordance with the relevant legislation.
For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold,  no liability is recognized before the specified minimum threshold  is reached.
The interpretation requires these same principles to  be applied in interim financial statements.
This has no impact  on the Company.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial instruments  – Offsetting  Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities*  Amendments to IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements,  IFRS 12  – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 27 –  Separate Financial Statements – Investment Entities*  Amendments to IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets – Recoverable  Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets*  Amendments to IAS 39  – Financial Instruments: Recognition  and Measurement – Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of  Hedge Accounting*  * The adoption of these accounting standards including  consequential amendments did not have any material impact  on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
New accounting standards not yet adopted:  A number of new standards, amendments to standards and  interpretations are not yet effective for annual periods beginning  after 1  April 2014, and have not been applied in preparing  these consolidated financial statements.
New standards,  amendments to standards and interpretations that could have  potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of  the Company are:  IFRS 9 – Financial instruments  In July 2014, the IASB completed its project to replace IAS  39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  by  publishing the final version of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments .
IFRS 9 introduces a single approach for the classification and  measurement of financial assets according to their cash flow  characteristics and the business model they are managed in,  and provides a new impairment model based on expected  credit losses.
IFRS 9 also includes new guidance regarding the  application of hedge accounting to better reflect an entity’s  risk management activities especially with regard to managing  non-financial risks.
The new standard is effective for annual  reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, while  early application is permitted.
The application of IFRS 9 may  have a material impact on the classification, measurement and  presentation of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities.
The  Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on  the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
IFRS 15 supersedes all existing revenue requirements in IFRS  ( IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18 Revenue and related  interpretations ).
According to the new standard, revenue is  recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services  to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration  to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for  those goods or services.
IFRS 15 establishes a five step model  that will apply to revenue earned from a contract with a  customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type  of revenue transaction or the industry.
Extensive disclosures  will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue;  information about performance obligation; changes in contract  asset and liability account balances between periods and key  judgments and estimates.
The standard permits the use of  either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or  after January  1, 2017; early application is permitted.
In May  2015, the IASB, through an exposure draft, proposed changing  the effective date to periods beginning on or after January  1, 2018 instead of January 1, 2017.
The Company is currently  assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Company’s  Consolidated Financial Statements.

Demerger of diversified business and disc ontinued  operations  During the financial year 2012-13, the Company had initiated  and completed the demerger of its consumer care and lighting,  infrastructure engineering and other non-IT business segment  (collectively, “the Diversified Business”).
The scheme was  effective March 31, 2013 (“Effective Date”) after the sanction of  the Honorable High Court and filing of the certified copy of the  scheme with the Registrar of Companies.

Also refer note  7 to the consolidated financial statements.
Following the Demerger, the Company’s remaining two  operating segments are IT Services and IT Products.
Goodwill as at March 31, 2014 and 2015 has been allocated to  the following operating segments:  Segments As at March 31,   2014   2015   IT Services ` 62,772 ` 67,394 IT Products 650 684 Total ` 63,422 ` 68,078 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill relating to IT  Services segment has been allocated to the CGUs as follows:  CGUs As at March 31,   2014   2015   Banking Financial Services and  Insurance (BFSI)` 13,763 ` 14,015 Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) 13,496 14,080 Retail, Consumer, Transport and  Government (RCTG) 9,515 9,426 Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities  (ENU) 11,738 15,768 Manufacturing and High-Tech (MFG) 11,563 11,644 Global Media and Telecom (GMT) 2,697 2,461 Total ` 62,772 ` 67,394 Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in accordance with  the Company’s procedure for determining the recoverable value  of such assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill  is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level within the  Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management  purposes, and which is not higher than the Company’s operating  segment.
The recoverable amount of the CGU within IT Services segment is  determined on the basis of Fair Value Less Cost To Sell (FVLCTS).
The FVLCTS of the CGU is determined based on the market  capitalization approach, using the turnover and earnings  multiples derived from observable market data.
The fair value  measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the  inputs in the valuation techniques used.
The carrying value of goodwill allocated to the CGU within IT  Products segment is not significant.
The recoverable value of  this CGU has been determined using value-in-use (VIU).
The VIU  is determined based on discounted cash flow projections.
Key  assumptions on which the Company has based its determination  of VIU include estimated cash flows, terminal value and discount  rates.
Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions.
The use  of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that  is materially different from the value-in-use that would result if  the calculation was performed using before tax assumptions.
The  before tax discount rate is determined based on the value-in-use  derived from the use of after tax assumptions.
Assumptions Y ear ended March 31,   2014   2015   Terminal value long-term growth  rate 5% 5% After tax discount rate 16.5% 16.5% Before tax discount rate 22.6% 24.9% Based on the above, no impairment was identified as of March 31,  2014 and 2015 as the recoverable value of the CGUs exceeded the  carrying value.
Further, none of the CGU’s tested for impairment  as of March 31, 2014 and 2015 were at risk of impairment.
An  analysis of the calculation’s sensitivity to a change in the key  parameters (revenue growth, operating margin, discount rate  and long-term growth rate) based on reasonably probable  assumptions, did not identify any probable scenarios where the  CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.

Business combination  Summary of acquisitions made in 2013-14 is given below:  Opus Capital Markets Consultants LLC  On January 14, 2014, the Company had obtained control of Opus  Capital Markets Consultants LLC (“Opus”) by acquiring 100% of  its share capital.
Opus is a US-based provider of mortgage due  diligence and risk management services.
The acquisition has  strengthened Wipro’s mortgage solutions and complemented  our existing offerings in mortgage origination, servicing and  secondary market.
The acquisition was executed through a share purchase  agreement for a consideration of ` 4,589 (US$ 75 million) which  included a deferred earn-out component of ` 1,285 (US$ 21  million), dependent on achievement of revenues and earnings  targets over a period of 3 years.
This earn-out liability was fair  valued at ` 782 and recorded as part of preliminary purchase  price allocation.
During the current year, the Company concluded the fair value  adjustments of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on  acquisition.
Consequently, the fair value of earn-out liability was  recorded at ` 589.
Comparatives have not been retrospectively  revised as the amounts are not material.

Goodwill is not expected to be  deductible for income tax purposes.
During the current year, the fair value of earn-out liability was  determined to be ` 144 as a result of changes in estimates of  revenue and earnings over the earn-out period.
The revision of  the estimates has inter alia resulted in reduction in the carrying  value of intangibles recognized on acquisition.
Accordingly, a  net gain of ` 470 has been recorded in the statement of income.
The fair value of earn-out consideration was estimated by  applying the Discounted Cash Flow approach.
The fair value  estimates are based on discount rate of 7% and probability  adjusted revenue and earnings estimates.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, an amount of ` 39 has  been paid to the sellers representing earn-out payments for the  calendar year 2014.
Summary of acquisitions made in 2014-15 is given below:  ATCO I-Tek Inc.  On August 15, 2014, the Company obtained control of ATCO  I-Tek Inc., a Canadian entity, by acquiring 100% of its share  capital and certain assets of IT services business of ATCO I-Tek  Australia (hereafter the acquisitions are collectively referred to  as ‘acquisition of ATCO I-Tek’) for an all-cash consideration of  ` 11,420 (Canadian Dollars 204 million).
ATCO I-Tek provides  IT services to ATCO Group.
The acquisition will strengthen  Wipro’s IT services delivery model in North America and  Australia.
As part of conclusion of certain closing conditions, ` 349 has  been reduced from the purchase price.
Consequently, the  Company concluded the fair value adjustments of the assets  acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition.
The following table presents the allocation of purchase price:  Description Pre-acquisition  carrying amount   Fair value  adjustments   Purchase price  allocated   Assets       Cash `     71 `     —   `         71 Property, plant and equipment (including capital work-in-progress  and software) 1,689 (278) 1,411 Trade receivables 210 —   210 Other assets 296 —   296 Customer related intangibles —   8,228 8,228 Liabilities       Trade payables and accrued liabilities (798) —   (798) Deferred income taxes, net (138) (2,017) (2,155) Total 1,330 5,933 7,263 Goodwill     3,808 Total purchase price     `  11,071 06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   232 6/21/2015   4:10:16 PM Wipro Limited 233 Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 233 The goodwill of ` 3,808 comprises value of expected synergies  arising from the acquisition.
Goodwill is not expected to be  deductible for income tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, ATCO I-Tek has contributed  ` 6,301  of revenue and  ` 868 of profit after taxes.
If the acquisition  had occurred on April  1, 2014, management estimates that  consolidated revenue for the Company would have been `  472,142 and the profit after taxes would have been ` 87,503 for  twelve months ended March 31, 2015.

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and  liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
Fair value  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,  unbilled revenues, trade payables, current financial liabilities and  borrowings approximate their carrying amount largely due to  the short-term nature of these instruments.
A substantial portion  of the Company’s long-term debt has been contracted at floating  rates of interest, which are reset at short intervals.
Accordingly,  the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair  value.
Further, finance lease receivables that are overdue are  periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness  of customers.
Based on this evaluation, the Company records  allowance for expected losses on these receivables.
As of  March 31, 2014 and 2015, the carrying value of such receivables,  net of allowances approximates the fair value.
Investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are  classified as available-for-sale are measured using quoted market  prices at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held.
Fair  value of investments in certificate of deposits, classified as  available for sale is determined using observable market inputs.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined  based on observable market inputs including currency spot and  forward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.
Fair value hierarchy  Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level  1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Derivatives assets and liabilities:  The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  on foreign currency assets / liabilities, forecasted cash flows  denominated in foreign currency and net investment in foreign  operations.
The Company follows established risk management  policies, including the use of derivatives to hedge foreign  currency assets / liabilities, foreign currency forecasted cash  flows and net investment in foreign operations.
The counter  party in these derivative instruments is a bank and the Company  considers the risks of non-performance by the counterparty as  non-material.

Sale of financial assets  From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company  transfers accounts receivables, unbilled revenues, net investment  in finance lease receivables (financials assets) to banks.
Under the  terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over  the financial assets and transfer is without recourse.
Accordingly,  such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets.
Gains and  losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded  at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial  assets and fair value of servicing liability.
In certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse.
Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated  to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits  specified in the agreement with the banks.
These are reflected  as part of loans and borrowings in the statement of financial  position.
Financial risk management  General  Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or  to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price  of a financial instrument.
The value of a financial instrument  may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign  currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect  market risk sensitive instruments.
Market risk is attributable to all  market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments,  foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.
The Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of  investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating  activities in foreign currency.
The objective of market risk  management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company’s  earnings and equity to losses.
Risk Management Procedures  The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury  department, which evaluates and exercises independent control  over the entire process of market risk management.
The corporate  treasury department recommends risk management objectives  and policies, which are approved by senior management and  Audit Committee.
The activities of this department include  management of cash resources, implementing hedging  strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies,  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.
Foreign currency risk  The Company operates internationally and a major portion of  its business is transacted in several currencies.
Consequently,  the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through  receiving payment for sales and services in the United States  and elsewhere, and making purchases from overseas suppliers  in various foreign currencies.
The exchange rate risk primarily  arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances,  forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and  borrowings.
A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is in  the U.S. Dollar, the United Kingdom Pound Sterling, the Euro, the  Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion  of costs are in Indian Rupees.
The exchange rate between the  rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent  years and may continue to fluctuate in the future.
Appreciation  of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the  Company’s results of operations.
The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from  these transactions and enters into foreign currency derivative  instruments to mitigate such exposure.
The Company follows  established risk management policies, including the use of  derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to  hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency.
The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as  cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure  of forecasted highly probable cash flows.
The Company has  also designated foreign currency borrowings as hedge against  respective net investments in foreign operations.
As of March  31, 2014 and 2015 respectively, a ` 1 increase/ decrease in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the  U.S. dollar would result in approximately ` 1,212 and ` 1,495  decrease/increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar  denominated derivative instruments.

Interest rate risk  Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing,  including various revolving and other lines of credit.
The  Company’s investments are primarily in short-term investments,  which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk.
The  Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating  to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements,  which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a  notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest  rates.
As of March 31, 2015, substantially all of the Company’s  borrowings were subject to floating interest rates, which reset  at short intervals.
If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps  from March 31, 2015, additional net annual interest expense on  floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ` 640.  Credit risk  Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not  be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
To manage this,  the Company periodically assesses the financial reliability of  customers, taking into account the financial condition, current  economic trends, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of  accounts receivable.
Individual risk limits are set accordingly.
No  single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts  receivable as of March  31, 2014 and 2015, respectively and  revenues for the year ended March 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015,  respectively.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired  Cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets,  investment in certificates of deposits and interest bearing  deposits with corporates are neither past due nor impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents with banks and interest-bearing  deposits are placed with corporate, which have high credit- ratings assigned by international and domestic credit-rating  agencies.
Available-for-sale financial assets substantially  include investment in liquid mutual fund units.
Certificates of  deposit represent funds deposited with banks or other financial  institutions for a specified time period.
Financial assets that are past due but not impaired  There is no other class of financial assets that is past due but  not impaired except for receivables of ` 4,585 and ` 5,510 as of  March 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Of the total receivables, `  59,927 and ` 67,997 as of March 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively,  were neither past due nor impaired.
The Company’s credit period  generally ranges from 45-60 days.
The aging analysis of the  receivables has been considered from the date the invoice falls  due.
The age wise break up of receivables, net of allowances that  are past due, is given below:    As at March 31,    2014 2015  Financial assets that are neither past  due nor impaired`  59,927 ` 67,997 Financial assets that are past due but  not impaired      Past due 0 – 30 days 4,996 7,343  Past due 31 – 60 days 4,646 3,936  Past due 61 – 90 days 3,259 2,876  Past due over 90 days 21,733 16,307 Total past due but not impaired `  34,634 ` 30,462 Counterparty risk  Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable  securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market  contracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits.
Issuer risk is  minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated  in India based on Indian rating agencies.
Settlement and credit  risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with  counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions  with acceptable credit ratings.
Exposure to these risks are closely  monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters.
There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution.
The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon  credit analysis including financial statements and capital  adequacy ratio reviews.
Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will  not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a  reasonable price.

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified  and recorded separately at the time of an acquisition is recorded  by an adjustment to goodwill.
Other than these, the change in  deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the  statement of income.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company  considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred  tax asset will be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred  tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable  profits during the periods in which those temporary differences  and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible.
The Company  considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities,  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in  making this assessment.
Based on this, the Company believes  that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of  these deductible differences.
The amount of deferred tax asset  considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near  term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry- forward period are reduced.
Deferred tax asset amounting to `  2,096 and ` 1,858 as at March 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively  in respect of unused tax losses have not been recognized by  the Company.
06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   243 6/21/2015   4:10:18 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 244 Annual Report 2014-15 The tax loss carry-forwards of ` 6,920 and ` 6,509 as at March 31,  2014 and March  31, 2015, respectively, relates to certain  subsidiaries on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized  by the Company, because there is a lack of reasonable certainty  that these subsidiaries may generate future taxable profits.
Approximately, ` 5,869 and ` 4,971 as at March 31, 2014 and  March  31, 2015, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards  is not currently subject to expiration dates.
The remaining tax  loss carry-forwards of approximately ` 1,051 and ` 1,538 as at  March  31, 2014 and March  31, 2015, respectively, expires in  various years through fiscal 2035.
The Company has recognized deferred tax assets of ` 4,207 and  ` 3,763 in respect of carry forward losses of its various subsidiaries  as at March 31, 2014 and 2015.
Management’s projections of  future taxable income and tax planning strategies support the  assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will  be available to utilize these deferred tax assets.
Pursuant to the changes in the Indian income tax laws, Minimum  Alternate Tax (MAT) has been extended to income in respect  of which deduction is claimed under Section 10A, 10B and  10AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961; consequently, the Company  has calculated its tax liability for current domestic taxes after  considering MAT.
The excess tax paid under MAT provisions  over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward and  set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal  tax provisions.
The Company was required to pay MAT and  accordingly, a deferred tax asset of ` 1,844 has been recognized  in the statement of financial position as of March 31, 2014 and  2015, which can be carried forward for a period of ten years from  the year of recognition.
A substantial portion of the profits of the Company’s India  operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits  attributable to export operations and profits from undertakings  situated in Software Technology, Hardware Technology Parks and  Export Oriented units.
Under the tax holiday, the taxpayer can  utilize an exemption from income taxes for a period of any ten  consecutive years.
The tax holidays on all facilities under Software  Technology, Hardware Technology Parks and Export oriented  units has expired on March  31, 2011.
Additionally, under the  Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme, units in designated  special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005  will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of profits or gains  derived from the export of services for the first five years from  commencement of provision of services and 50 percent of such  profits and gains for a further five years.
Certain tax benefits are  also available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting  defined conditions.
Profits from certain other undertakings are  also eligible for preferential tax treatment.
The tax holiday period  being currently available to the Company expires in various  years through fiscal 2028.
The expiration period of tax holiday  for each unit within a SEZ is determined based on the number  of years that have lapsed following year of commencement of  production by that unit.
The impact of tax holidays has resulted  in a decrease of current tax expense from continuing operations  of ` 9,244, ` 11,043 and ` 11,412 for the years ended March 31,  2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, compared to the effective tax  amounts that we estimate we would have been required to pay  if these incentives had not been available.
The per share effect  of these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2014  and 2015 was ` 3.77, ` 4.50 and ` 4.65 respectively.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable  temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where  the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be  controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will  not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, deferred  income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries  amounting to ` 28,959 and ` 21,954 as of March 31, 2014 and  2015, respectively has not been recognized.
Further, it is not  practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred  tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.
The Company is subject to U.S. tax on income attributable to its  permanent establishment in the United States due to operation  of the U.S. branch.
In addition, the Company is subject to a 15%  branch profit tax in the United States on the “dividend equivalent  amount” as that term is defined under U.S. tax law.
The Company  has not triggered the branch profit tax until year ended March 31,  2015.
The Company intends to maintain the current level of net  assets in the United States commensurate with its operation and  consistent with its business plan.
The Company does not intend  to repatriate out of the United States any portion of its current  profits.
Accordingly, the Company did not record current and  deferred tax provision for branch profit tax.
20.
Dividends  The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees.
According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should  be declared out of accumulated distributable profits.
A  company may, before the declaration of any dividend, transfer a  percentage of its profits for that financial year as it may consider  appropriate to the reserves.
The cash dividends paid per equity share were ` 6, ` 8 and `  10 during the years ended March  31, 2013, 2014 and 2015,  respectively, including an interim dividend of ` 2, ` 3 and ` 5 for  the years ended March 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on April  21, 2015  proposed a final dividend of ` 7 (U.S.$ 0.11) per equity share and  ADS.
The proposal is subject to the approval of shareholders at  the ensuing Annual General Meeting of the shareholders, and  if approved, would result in a cash outflow of approximately  ` 20,739, including corporate dividend tax thereon.
The  proposed dividend has not been included as a liability in these  consolidated financial statements.
21.
Additional capital disclosures  The key objective of the Company’s capital management is  to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with the  focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer  confidence and to ensure future development of its business.
The  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   244 6/21/2015   4:10:18 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS Wipro Limited 245 Company focused on keeping strong total equity base to ensure  independence, security, as well as a high financial flexibility for  potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the  risk profile of the Company.
The Company’s goal is to continue to be able to return excess  liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual  dividends in future periods.
The Company has distributed an  interim dividend of ` 5 per equity share during the year ended  March  31, 2015.
The Board of Directors in their meeting on  April 21, 2015 proposed a final dividend of ` 7 (U.S.$ 0.11) per  equity share and ADS.
The proposal is subject to the approval of  shareholders.
The amount of future dividends will be balanced  with efforts to continue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.
The capital structure as of March  31, 2014 and 2015 was as  follows:    As at March 31,        2014   2015   % Change Total equity attributable  to the equity  shareholders of the  Company` 343,499 ` 407,982 18.77% As percentage of total  capital 87% 84%   Current loans and  borrowings 40,683 66,206   Non-current loans and  borrowings 10,909 12,707   Total loans and  borrowings 51,592 78,913 52.96% As percentage of total  capital 13% 16%   Total capital (loans and  borrowings and equity)` 395,091 ` 486,895 23.24% The Company is predominantly equity-financed.
This is also  evident from the fact that loans and borrowings represented  only 13% and 16% of total capital as of March 31, 2014 and 2015,  respectively.
Further, the Company has consistently been a net  cash company with cash and bank balance along with available  for sale investments being in excess of debt.
The company is not  subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Employee share options are dilutive potential equity  shares for the Company.
The calculation is performed in respect of share options to  determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at  fair value (determined as the average market price of the Company’s  shares during the period).
The number of shares calculated as above  is compared with the number of shares that would have been  issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

Commitments and contingencies  Operating leases:  The Company has taken office, residential  facilities and IT equipment under cancellable and non- cancellable operating lease agreements that are renewable on  a periodic basis at the option of both the lessor and the lessee.
The operating lease agreements extend up to a maximum of  fifteen years from their respective dates of inception and some  of these lease agreements have price escalation clause.
Rental  payments under such leases were ` 4,177, ` 4,583 and ` 4,727  for the year ended March 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively  in respect of continuing operations.
Details of contractual payments under non-cancelable leases  are given below:      As at March 31,  2014  2015  Not later than one year `         2,584 `        3,351 Later than one year but not later  than five years5,413 6,385 Later than five years 2,881 2,206   `      10,878 `     11,942 Capital commitments: As at March  31, 2014 and 2015, the  Company had committed to spend approximately ` 778 and `  1,262 respectively, under agreements to purchase property and  equipment.
These amounts are net of capital advances paid in  respect of these purchases.
Guarantees:  As at March  31, 2014 and 2015, performance  and financial guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the  Company to the Indian Government, customers and certain  other agencies amount to approximately ` 22,864 and ` 21,234  respectively, as part of the bank line of credit.
Contingencies and lawsuits: In March 2004, the Company received  a tax demand for year ended March 31, 2001 arising primarily on  account of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income  Tax Act, 1961 (Act) in respect of profit earned by the Company’s  undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bangalore.
The same  issue was repeated in the successive assessments for the years  ended March  31, 2002 to March  31, 2010 and the aggregate  demand is ` 46,515 (including interest of ` 13,673).
The appeals  filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities  have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second  appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2007.
Further  appeals have been filed by the Income tax authorities before  the Honorable High Court.
The Honorable High Court has heard  and disposed-off the appeals up to years ended March 31, 2004.
Order of the Honorable High Court is not yet received.
On similar issues for years prior to years ended March 2001, the  Honorable High Court in Karnataka has upheld the claim of the  Company under section 10A of the Act.
For the years ended  March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, the appeals are pending  before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Tribunal).
For year ended  March 31, 2010, the Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP) allowed the  claim of the Company under section 10A of the Act.
The Income  tax authorities have filed an appeal before the Tribunal.
For year ended March 2011, the Company received the draft  assessment order in March 2015, on similar grounds as that of  earlier years, with a demand of ` 7,852 (including interest of `  2,547) for the year ended March 31, 2011.
Considering the facts and nature of disallowance and the order  of the appellate authority/ Honorable Karnataka High Court  upholding the claims of the Company for earlier years, the  Company believes that the final outcome of the above disputes  should be in favor of the Company and there should not be any  material adverse impact on the financial statements.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which  have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
The resolution  of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a material and  adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial  position of the Company.
The Contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for  excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters amounts to  ` 2,560 and ` 2,338 as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Segment Information  Following the demerger of the Diversified Business (the  “Demerger”), the Company is organized by the following  operating segments: IT Services and IT Products.
IT Services:  The IT Services segment primarily consists of IT  Service offerings to customers organized by industry verticals  as follows: Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI),  06_US Gap IFRS_182-232.indd   255 6/21/2015   4:10:20 PM Consolidated Financial Statements Under IFRS 256 Annual Report 2014-15 Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS), Retail, Consumer, Transport  and Government (RCTG), Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities  (ENU), Manufacturing and High-Tech (MFG), Global Media and  Telecom (GMT).
For the year ended March  31, 2015, it also  includes Others which comprises dividend income and gains or  losses (net) relating to strategic investments, which are presented  within “Finance and other income” in the statement of Income.
Key service offering to customers includes software application  development and maintenance, research and development  services for hardware and software design, business application  services, analytics, consulting, infrastructure outsourcing  services and business process services.
Following the Demerger, to align with industry trends, the  Company has reported IT Services revenue and results by  industry verticals beginning with the year ended March 31, 2014.
The IT Services segment information for the comparative period  (year ended March 31, 2013) by industry class of customers is  not restated to reflect the above change since the meaningful  segregation of the data is impracticable.
However, as required  under IFRS 8, the Company has presented segment information  for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015 on both the old  basis and new basis of segmentation.
IT Products : The IT Products segment sells a range of Wipro  personal desktop computers, Wipro servers and Wipro  notebooks.
The Company is also a value added reseller of  desktops, servers, notebooks, storage products, networking  solutions and packaged software for leading international  brands.
In certain total outsourcing contracts of the IT Services  segment, the Company delivers hardware, software products  and other related deliverables.
During FY 2013-14, the Company  ceased the manufacturing of ‘Wipro branded desktops, laptops  and servers’ .
Revenue relating to the above items is reported as  revenue from the sale of IT Products.
The Chairman of the Company has been identified as the  Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) as defined by IFRS 8,  “Operating Segments.
” The Chairman of the Company evaluates  the segments based on their revenue growth and operating  income.
Assets and liabilities used in the Company’s business are not  identified to any of the operating segments, as these are used  interchangeably between segments.
Management believes that  it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures  relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful  segregation of the available data is onerous.
