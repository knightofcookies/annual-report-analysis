Emerging markets, including  India, had to face multiple  challenges of rising current  account deficit, depreciation  of the local currency and  additional pressure due to  capital outflows.
Despite global and domestic  challenges, Reliance continued its  growth path.
Reliance achieved a  record revenue of ` 4,01,302 crore  ($ 67 .0 billion) and net profit of  ` 21,984 crore ($ 3.7 billion).
We  became the first company in the  private sector to record revenues of  over ` 4,00,000 crore.
Reliance also  achieved its highest ever exports  of ` 2,75,825 crore ($ 46.0 billion)  during the year, contributing  a record 69% of revenues.
The  continued growth of exports is an  indicator of the growing demand  for our products and services across  the world.
Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director  5 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports4 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... 02-33  Company Overview 110% Capacity utilisation at the  Jamnagar refinery against  average utilisation rates of 85%  in North America, 76% in Europe  and 85% in Asia First  Private sector company in   India to record revenues of over   ` 4,00,000 crore  FY 2013-14 was another record- setting year for RIL.
Our Refining  business delivered the highest- ever profits with a sharp recovery  in gross refining margins towards  the end of the year.
Petrochemical  earnings grew significantly with  margin expansion across polymers  and downstream polyester  products.
The vertical integration across  the refining and petrochemicals  chain is a major advantage due to  assured feedstock, lower volatility  of margins and ability to take  advantage of the opportunity in  each product in the chain.
Domestic upstream production  was lower compared to the  prior year due to continuing  geological complexities.
The  shale gas business in the US grew  significantly during the year and  has become a material contributor  to our earnings.
We are now India’s largest retailer  and turned profitable this year.
We have also accelerated our  efforts to roll-out our state-of-the- art 4G services across the country,  which will add an exciting new  dimension to our consumer facing  service offerings.
Refining & Marketing Our Jamnagar refinery complex  continued to operate at over 1 10%  of the design capacity, processing  68.0 MMT of crude, testament to  our world-class assets and quality  of operations.
Global utilisation  rates, in comparison, were 85% in  North America, 76% in Europe and  85% in Asia.
This was supported  by stable middle distillate cracks,  favourable crude differentials and  currency movement.
In addition  to the market dynamics, Reliance's  performance was driven by its  operational excellence and well- executed strategies around crude  sourcing and product placement.
Continuing its emphasis on  processing the challenging and  most advantageous crudes, 64% of  the total crude processed during  the year was “advantaged”.
The  ability to operate at high utilisation  levels and optimise product slate  to suit market conditions enabled  Reliance to capture opportunities in  the market.
As a part of our continuing  efforts for energy conservation,  we are working on the petcoke  gasification project which is under  rapid execution.
This will provide  competitive energy costs for our  integrated refining complex at  Jamnagar and improve profitability.
Petrochemicals Earnings from the Petrochemical  business increased by 17 .5% on  the back of strong polymer and  downstream polyester margins  coupled with favourable exchange  rate movement.
This was partly  offset by weak fibre margins in the  second half of the year Demand growth in India for  petrochemical products during  FY 2013-14 was at a cyclical low  compared to the double digit  growth rates seen in the prior five  and ten year periods.
Domestic  polymer demand growth was  particularly weak at 3%.
Reliance  increased its polymer production  by 2% to 4.5 MMT and maintained  its leadership with a market share  of 40% in the domestic polymer  market.
Record Performance Reliance achieved a record  revenue of ` 4,01,302 crore   ($ 67.0 billion) and net profit  of ` 21,984 crore ($ 3.7 billion).
Achieved highest ever  refining earnings during   the year.

Domestic polyester demand  growth was at 6%.
Reliance commissioned its new  PFY facility at Silvassa which is the  most automated and one of the  most environment friendly plants  globally.
This is the first in the series  of expansions that have been  planned.
With the economy and  consumption being at the bottom  of the down-cycle, the RIL start-ups  would be ideally placed at a time  when demand would emerge.
Exploration and  Production In our domestic upstream business,  production from the KG-D6 block  continued to decline during  the year.
The fall in production  is mainly attributed to the  geological complexity and natural  decline in the fields and higher  than envisaged water ingress.
Several activities were therefore  undertaken to sustain production  and enhance recovery from the  existing producing fields.
During  the year, two significant discoveries  were made in the KG basin and  Cauvery basin.
Development  activities in the two CBM blocks  is gathering momentum.
The  new discoveries and the efforts to  enhance recovery will strengthen  India’s energy security.
Reliance continued to balance  its international portfolio by  evaluating new blocks and  assigning existing blocks.
Reliance’s  Shale Gas business continued  on its growth path and has now  achieved materiality in many  respects.
Our investments in the  US Shale Gas ventures have started  creating value for our shareholders.
This business achieved record  revenues and EBITDA for the year  with significant growth.
Reliance's  share of net sales was at 131 BCFe  in CY 2013, a growth of 54% y-o-y  on account of about 1.6 fold  increase in number of wells put on  production from end of CY 2012.
Consumer Businesses We are delighted that our retail  business continues to sustain its  leadership position across several  formats.
It has become India’s  largest retailer by revenues.
It  achieved the milestone of over 10  million square feet of retail space  during the year.
It also achieved  break-even on a net profit basis  during the year.

However, substantive  sections of the Act which deal with the general working of  companies stand notified.
With the coming into force of the Act several regulations  of the existing AoA of the Company require alteration  or deletions in several articles.
Given this position, it is  considered expedient to wholly replace the existing AoA by  a new set of Articles.
The new AoA to be substituted in place of the existing  AoA are based on Table ‘F’ of the Act which sets out the  model articles of association for a company limited by  shares.
Shareholder’s attention is invited to certain salient  provisions in the new draft AoA of the Company viz: (a) Company’s lien now extends also to bonuses declared  from time to time in respect of shares over which   lien exists; (b) the nominee(s) of a deceased sole member are  recognized as having title to the deceased’s interest in  the shares; (c) new provisions regarding applicati on of funds from  reserve accounts when amounts in reserve accounts  are to be capitalized; (d) new provisions relating to appointment of chief  executive officer and chief financial officer, in addition  to  manager and company secretary; (e) existing articles have been streamlined and aligned  with the Act; (f ) the statutory provisions of the Act which permit a  company to do some acts “if so authorized by its  articles” or provisions which require a company  to do acts in a prescribed manner “unless the  articles otherwise provide” have been specifically   included; and (g) provisions of the existing AoA which are already part of  statute in the Act have not been reproduced in the new  draft AoA as they would only lead to duplication – their  non-inclusion makes the new AoA crisp, concise and  clear and aids ease of reading and understanding.
The proposed new draft AoA is being uploaded on the  Company’s website for perusal by the shareholders.
None of the Directors / Key Managerial Personnel of the  Company / their relatives are, in any way, concerned or  interested, financially or otherwise, in the Special Resolution  set out at Item No.

OVERVIEW The global economy began its modest recovery in FY 2013- 14 with improved demand from OECD economies in the  second half of 2013.
While the trend is expected to accelerate  in the current year, the positive outlook is subdued by the  potential consequences of ‘tapering’ of some of the US  Federal Reserve’s Quantitative Easing (QE) policies which  were undertaken in the aftermath of global financial crises.
Emerging markets like India faced multiple challenges:  capital outflows, intense exchange rate pressures and  volatile current account movement.
A combination of  persistent inflation, fiscal imbalances, external sector  vulnerabilities and low investments resulted in sluggish  domestic demand growth.
Fiscal and monetary initiatives  taken by the Indian government and the Reserve Bank of  India (RBI) helped stabilise financial market conditions, but  the domestic macro-economic environment still remains  challenging.
Economic recovery in the US and Europe had a positive  impact on oil demand, which increased by 1.3 million  barrels per day (MMBPD) in 2013.
Crude oil prices fluctuated  extensively, driven by supply concerns in Libya, South  Sudan, West Africa and Iraq.
Higher US shale oil production  helped offset the impact of these disruptions with Brent  crude oil prices averaging marginally lower at $ 108.7 per  barrel in 2013.
Operating in a volatile and uncertain environment, Reliance  Industries Limited (RIL) demonstrated the resilience of its  business model.
RIL ’s best-in-class refining configuration  and integrated petrochemical business enabled it to deliver  robust profits in FY 2013-14.
The Company achieved:  zz Highest ever Revenue of ` 4,01,302 crore ($ 67.0 billion)  and Net profit of ` 21,984 crore ($ 3.7 billion) zz Record Exports of ` 2,75,825 crore ($ 46.0 billion) zz Record Refining business EBIT ` 13,220 crore   ($ 2.2 billion) zz Highest ever consolidated Revenue and Net profit of   ` 4,46,339 crore ($ 74.5 billion) and ` 22,493 crore   ($ 3.8 billion) respectively  zz Dividend of 95%, highest ever payout of ` 3,268 crore   ($ 545 million) Operationally, downstream segments continued to deliver  superior performance with operating rates of over 100%.
RIL processed 68.0 million tonnes (MMT) of crude oil at its  Jamnagar refinery complex.
The KG-D6 (JV) facility produced  2.31 million barrels (MMBL) of crude and condensate and  178.3 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas.
RIL ’s share  of gross JV production in US Shale was 154 BCFe in 2013  reflecting a growth of 52% over previous year.
The Company featured in the Fortune Global 500 list of  the world’s largest corporations for the tenth consecutive  year and was ranked 107th in terms of revenues and 128th in  terms of profits.
HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY EVENTS RIL delivered strong results across its refining, petrochemicals  and international E&P businesses whilst continuing to grow  and invest in its energy value chain.
In addition, substantial  progress was made in consumer-facing businesses - retail  and telecom.

Refining – Record earnings  The refining business had a record performance during  the year delivering the highest ever annual contribution  to the Company’s EBIT.
RIL ’s refining margins at $ 8.1/bbl  significantly outperformed regional benchmarks as the  superior configuration of its refineries enabled it to benefit  from stable middle distillate margins and widening light- heavy crude oil differentials.
Petrochemicals – New PFY plant  commissioned  Petrochemical business EBIT margins improved to 8.9%  from 8.3% in the previous year driving a 17.5% growth in  EBIT to ` 8,612 crore, with an improvement in polymer chain  margins.
Polyester Filament Yarn (PFY) plant at Silvassa was  commissioned successfully during FY 2013-14.
Three  products Partially Oriented Yarn (POY), Fully Drawn Yarn  (FDY) and Polyester Textured Yarn (PTY) are being produced  at the site and all units are now fully operational.
The new  PFY plant at Silvassa is one of the most automated and  environment friendly plants globally.
It is co-located with  RIL ’s existing texturizing facility at Silvassa eliminating the  packaging and logistics costs.
The entire production from  this facility has been successfully placed in the domestic  and international markets.
With the commissioning of  this ultra-modern PFY facility, RIL ’s total PFY capacity,  including the facilities at Recron (wholly owned subsidiary  in Malaysia) is now in excess of 1.5 MMTPA.
The polyester  facility is the first amongst a series of projects which will add  significantly to RIL ’s petrochemical volumes and enhance  cost-competitiveness.
Oil & Gas – New discoveries and growth in  Shale The US shale gas business is now a material contributor  to RIL ’s consolidated profits.
The shale business delivered  revenues of $ 819 million and EBITDA of $ 616 million in  2013 on the back of a 52% growth in volumes to 154 BCFe.
Proved reserves of shale gas increased 43% to 2.66 TCFe.
In May 2013, RIL and its partners made a significant gas and  condensate discovery (MJ-1) in the KG-D6 block of Krishna  Godavari basin, off the eastern coast of India.
This discovery  is expected to add to the hydrocarbon resources in the KG- D6 block.
In August 2013, RIL and BP also announced a new gas  condensate discovery off India’s east coast in the Cauvery  basin.
The discovery, in the deepwater block CY-D5, is  situated 62 kilometres from the coast in the Cauvery Basin  and is the second gas discovery in the block.
Retail business – India’s largest retail chain Reliance Retail has become India’s largest retailer by  revenues.
FY 2013-14 revenues grew 34% to ` 14,496 crore,  while EBITDA was at ` 363 crore.
The retail business also  achieved two major milestones in FY 2013-14.
It crossed  10 million square feet of retail space and broke even on a  net profit basis during the year.
The Company enhanced its  presence across various format sectors.
Reliance Retail now  operates 1,691 stores across 146 cities.
Reliance Jio – accelerated efforts to roll-out  4G services Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. (RJIL) successfully acquired the  right to use spectrum in 14 key circles across India in the  1,800 MHz band in the spectrum auction conducted by  Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Government  New polyester facility at Silvassa Record Earnings ` 22,493 crore  ($ 3.8 billion) highest ever consolidated  net profit  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 49 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports48 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... of India (GoI).
RJIL will use this spectrum in conjunction  with its pan India 2,300 MHz spectrum acquired earlier  to provide seamless 4G services using FDD-LTE on 1,800  MHz and TDD-LTE on 2,300 MHz through an integrated  ecosystem.
Following the acquisition, RJIL holds the largest  quantum of liberalised spectrum, with the longest residual   spectrum life.
Earlier in the year, RJIL received Unified License for all 22  Service Areas across India and became the first telecom  operator in the country to get a pan India license.
The  license allows RJIL to offer all telecom services including  voice telephony under a single license.
The Company has  migrated from its existing ISP license, along with Broadband  Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum, to the Unified License.

These agreements are aimed at avoiding  duplication of infrastructure, whilst also helping to preserve  capital and the environment.
The infrastructure tie-ups will  enable the accelerated roll-out of RJIL ’s state-of-the-art 4G  services.
Credit rating upgrade S&P upgraded RIL ’s international debt rating to BBB+ with a  ‘negative’ outlook, which is now two notches above India’s  sovereign rating.
The upgrade confirms RIL ’s strong financial  metrics and liquidity position in the sector.
RIL delivered superior financial performance with  improvements across key parameters.
Revenue from operations  of ` 4,01,302 crore ($ 67.0  billion), increased 8.1% on a y-o-y basis.
Higher prices  accounted for 7.7% growth in revenue and increase in  volumes accounted for 0.4% growth in revenue.
Revenues  were positively impacted by a sharp movement in exchange  rate, with a 10.4% depreciation of the Indian rupee vis-à-vis  the US dollar.
Exports were higher by 15.3% at ` 2,75,825  crore ($ 46.0 billion) as against ` 2,39,266 crore in FY 2012- 13. zz Refining business contributes 78% of revenues (including  inter-divisional transfer) and grew by 8.4% as compared  to previous year.
The growth in revenue was driven by  8.1% increase in prices and 0.3% higher volumes  zz Petrochemicals business accounted for 21% of revenues  and grew by 9.5% as compared to previous year.
The  growth in revenue was contributed by 8.6% increase in  price and 0.9% higher volumes zz Oil & gas business revenue declined by 26.7% as  compared to previous year largely on account of 39.7%  decline in production  Operating profit before other income and depreciation  increased marginally from ` 30,787crore to ` 30,877 crore  ($ 5.2 billion) in FY 2013-14 with higher contribution from  refining and petrochemical business, partly offset by lower  contribution from the upstream business.
Higher cost of  crude oil and other raw materials in rupee terms resulted  in a 7.6% increase in cost of raw materials to ` 3,29,313  crore ($ 55.0 billion).
Net operating margin was lower at  7.9% compared to 8.5% in the previous year due to reduced  contribution from oil & gas business.
Other income  was higher at ` 8,936 crore ($ 1.5 billion) as  against ` 7,998 crore in the previous year, largely on account  49 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports48 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... of higher investible surplus.
Other income includes interest  income of ` 6,472 crore and investment income of ` 2,348  crore.
Interest cost was higher at ` 3,206 crore ($ 535 million) as  against ` 3,036 crore in FY 2012-13.
With majority of the  Company’s borrowing in foreign currency, sharp rupee  depreciation during the year negatively impacted interest  costs.
This resulted in gross interest cost being higher at   ` 3,907 crore ($ 652 million) as against ` 3,421 crore in   FY 2012-13.
Interest capitalised was higher at ` 701 crore   ($ 117 million) as against ` 385 crore last year, on account of  the large on-going capex programme.
Depreciation (including depletion and amortisation) was  lower by 7.1% at ` 8,789 crore ($ 1.5 billion) as against   ` 9,465 crore in FY 2012-13.
This was primarily due to   lower depletion charges, in-line with decline in upstream oil  & gas production.
Tax expenses for the year increased to ` 5,834 crore ($ 974  million) as compared to ` 5,281 crore in the previous year.
Profit after tax  for the year was at ` 21,984 crore   ($ 3.7 billion) an increase of 4.7% over ` 21,003 crore in  the previous year.
Growth in net profit was led by higher  operating income from the refining and petrochemical  businesses, higher other income and lower depreciation.
The basic and diluted EPS for the year was ` 68.0 per share  as compared to ` 64.8 per share in FY 2012-13 registering a  growth of 4.9%.
The Board of Directors have recommended, subject to  approval of shareholders, a dividend of 95% amounting to  ` 3,268 crore ($ 545 million), including dividend distribution  tax.
This shall be the highest payout ever by RIL and balances  on-going capex commitments and shareholder interests.
Return on capital employed  was at 11.5% and return on  equity was at 12.9%.
Return ratios improved marginally  compared to the previous year with stronger performance  in refining and petrochemical businesses.
RIL ’s consolidated revenue from operations  for FY 2013- 14 was ` 4,46,339 crore ($ 74.5 billion), an increase of 9.3%  on a y-o-y basis.
Consolidated profit after tax was at   ` 22,493 crore ($ 3.8 billion), an increase of 7.7% against   ` 20,879 crore in the previous year.
EPS on consolidated  basis for the year was at ` 76.5 as against ` 70.7 in the  previous year.
Key contributors to incremental consolidated  revenues and profit were the US shale operations and  domestic retail business.

RIL ’s gross debt to equity ratio including long-term  and short-term debt as on 31 st March, 2014 stood at 0.45,  net debt to equity ratio was 0.01, and net gearing was 0.8%.
RIL moved from a net cash position at the beginning of  the year, to a marginal net debt level during the course of  the year as it drew down on funding to part finance the  expansion of its petrochemical capacities and setting up the  new gasification plant and refinery off-gas cracker over the  next two to three years.
The Company continued to efficiently manage its short- term resources by placing them in liquid instruments and  highly rated securities, such as bank fixed deposits, CDs,  Government securities and corporate bonds.
RIL raises  capital resources in line with its strategy of extending the  average maturity of its long term debt, at a competitive cost  and tying up financing at early stages of project execution.
RIL continuously undertakes liability management to  reduce cost of debt and to diversify its liability mix.

RIL ’s financial discipline and prudence is reflected in the  strong credit ratings ascribed by rating agencies.
In May 2013, S&P upgraded RIL ’s international debt rating  to BBB+ with a ‘negative’ outlook which is two notches  above India’s sovereign rating.
S&P’s rating upgrade  took cognizance of RIL ’s plans to invest significantly in  growing its businesses over the next 3 years.
S&P believes  that the expansion program would further strengthen  RIL ’s competitive position and profitability.
The upgrade  confirms RIL ’s strong financial metrics and liquidity position  in the sector.
Moody’s has rated RIL ’s international debt at investment  grade Baa2, with ‘positive’ outlook which is one notch above  India’s sovereign rating.
RIL ’s long-term debt is rated AAA by CRISIL and ‘Ind AAA’ by  Fitch, the highest rating awarded by both these agencies.
Similarly, RIL ’s short-term debt is rated P1+ by CRISIL, the  highest credit rating assigned in this category.
RIL ’s superior credit profile is reflected in its lending  relationships, with over 100 banks and financial institutions  having commitments to RIL.
In continuation of the fund raising programme initiated  in FY 2012-13, RIL tied up facilities of around $ 3.15 billion  equivalent to part finance the petrochemical expansions  and petcoke gasification projects through landmark  transactions.
During FY 2013-14, RIL signed $ 500 million equivalent  facilities backed by two Export Credit Agencies (ECAs)  which included $ 300 million facility from Export Credits  Guarantee Department (ECGD), the UK ECA, and $ 200  million equivalent facility from The Compagnie Française  d’Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur (COFACE), the  French ECA.
These facilities will be drawn over the next  two to three years as the projects progress and will have  a door-to-door tenor of over 10 to 13 years.
These deals  were accorded ‘Better than Sovereign’ rating by both the  ECAs.
This is the first time these agencies accorded such a  rating to any corporate in their history, re-emphasising RIL ’s  creditworthiness in international debt markets.
For the ECA deals, RIL has received the ‘TFR Deals of the Year’  award for 2013 from Trade and Forfaiting Review, ‘Deals of  the Year 2013’ award from Trade Finance Magazine and ‘GTR  Best Deal of 2013’ award from Global Trade Review and ‘TFX  Perfect 10 Deals of the Year’ award for 2013 from Trade and  Export Finance.
The syndicated loan deal of $ 1.75 billion equivalent  completed during the year represented the largest bank  group in Asia in the last two years.
The deal enjoyed a  strong participation of 30 international banks, despite  turbulent market conditions.
This unsecured syndicated  loan has a tenor in excess of five years and has one of the  longest tenors for a senior unsecured corporate loan in Asia   this year.
Additionally, loans aggregating $ 900 million were raised  through a mix of club and bilateral loans during a period  of extreme volatility in INR/USD currency with the INR  witnessing sharp depreciation.
One of the loans (8.75 years  tenor) probably has the longest tenor for a senior unsecured  corporate loan in Asia in 2013.
During FY 2013-14, Reliance Holding USA Inc. (RHUSA)  through its wholly owned subsidiary tied up five year  revolving reserve based lending facility with a maximum  commitment of $ 300 million to finance the capital  expenditure.
With this, the total reserve based lending  commitments of RHUSA across its subsidiaries aggregates  to a maximum of $ 1.3 billion.
In addition to this, another  wholly owned subsidiary of RHUSA executed a five year  unsecured term loan facility with a maximum commitment  of $ 350 million.

Business Performance REFINING AND MARKETING Market environment and outlook – Global  Crude oil Oil mark ets broadly followed trends of recent years and  prices remained within the range established therein.
New refining capacity in the Middle East, Asia and increased  utilisation of the resurgent US industry led to a weaker  refining margin environment.
However, the flexibility and  capability in the Reliance system in terms of feedstock run,  product flexibility and efficient product placement, coupled  with a weaker rupee allowed R&M to deliver a record  performance in FY 2013-14.
Global economy and oil demand  The macro-economic environment began to show signs  of recovery, led by the OECD countries.
Major economic  indicators from USA demonstrated positive sentiments  and the country posted strong GDP numbers across the  quarters.
The EU zone, which had witnessed a recession in  2012, recovered in 2013-14.
Emerging markets in contrast  struggled to sustain their high growth rates and deal with  inflationary pressures.
China in particular looks to have  moved to a more moderate growth path.
Against this mildly positive economic backdrop, oil demand  grew by 1.3 MMBPD to 91.4 MMBPD.
Non-OECD countries  led by China contributed to almost the entire oil demand  growth.
Relatively sluggish economic activity and increasing  energy efficiency has led to a decline in absolute demand in  developed economies.
Oil supply On the supply side, overall supply increased by 0.6 MMBPD,  led by Non-OPEC supply which grew by 1.3 MMBPD during  2013 reducing the call on OPEC.
Geo-political tension and social unrest in several major oil  exporting countries in the Middle East and Africa impacted  oil supplies.
As a result, there were periods when over 3  MMBPD were removed from the market.
The US shale oil revolution has led to a surge in the North  American oil production, contributing significantly to the  OECD oil supplies.
In 2013, US oil production (including  NGLs) increased by 1 MMBPD to 10.3 MMBPD, contributing  to fundamental changes in global oil trade flows.
The  increased US oil production is replacing Latin American and  West African crude imports into US, resulting in increased  flows to Asia.
Oil prices  Countervailing factors impacted oil markets in 2013.
The  geo-political environment continued to remain volatile  leading to supply disruptions.
Despite reduced call on  OPEC, geo-political concerns on supply outlook together  with actual disruptions, kept Brent oil prices in the $ 90 to   $ 115 per barrel range that has been established over recent  years.
Some de-bottlenecking in crude transportation  infrastructure, including huge growth in rail facilities, partly  helped US crude prices recover versus Brent and Dubai.
However, WTI is likely to continue to trade at a discount to  global benchmarks due to infrastructure and regulatory  constraints.
In FY 2013-14, Brent to WTI crude differential  narrowed to $ 8.6/bbl as compared to $ 18.1/bbl in   FY 2012-13.
Refining margins The dominant impact on global margins and trade flows  was the increase in US product exports, mainly as a result  of higher operating rates, ramp-up of new facilities and  Superior Credit Profile Best  Borrower  of the Year 2013  in Asia – Finance Asia Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 53 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports52 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... addition of some simple refining capacity.
New capacity  also came on-stream in China and in the Middle East – with  the Jubail refinery ramping up production during the year.
On the positive side - impact of material closures in the  Atlantic region last year, high incidences of unplanned  outages and delayed commissioning of refineries, provided  some support to margins.
Demand for refined products was  also higher than estimates at the beginning of the year.
On  an annualised basis margins were weaker as compared to  the previous year.
The year witnessed significant divergence in regional  margins.
US refineries benefitted from low energy and  cheap feedstock prices.
While the narrowing of Brent- WTI differential had a negative impact, absolute refining  margins in the US continue to be at high levels.
Growth in  demand emanated largely from the Eastern hemisphere,  providing support to Asian margins, including Reliance.
European refining margins witnessed dual pressure on  account of increased import availability from the US and ME  region and weak local demand.
Continued margin pressure  on European refining system could lead to further capacity  rationalisation.
RIL refining margins outperformed Singapore benchmark,  widening the premium over the benchmark to $ 2.2/bbl  during FY 2013-14.
RIL benefited from its ability to run  advantaged feedstock, flexibility to upgrade low value  products and the capacity to switch production to the most  valuable product as the market evolved.

In 2013, middle distillate demand grew by over 450 KBD,  contributing almost 35% of global oil demand growth.
In  line with seasonal patterns, gasoil cracks started low in  the first quarter but gained strength through the year as  demand picked up.
Demand for gasoil remained supported  by growing industrial activity and a colder-than-expected  winter in the US.
Subsidies on diesel in most of the emerging  Asian economies continue to support strong demand  growth.
Jet witnessed a low margin environment throughout the  year amid ample supplies and warmer weather in North  Asia, where kerosene is used for heating.
Indian diesel demand shrank by 1%, the first decline in over  a decade.
This was partly in response to the slowdown in  industrial activity and in part due to the removal of subsidies  to the commercial sector.
Light distillates Light ends witnessed a mixed year.
Gasoline cracks remained  subdued through the major part of the year, except the US  driving season and the last quarter of the year.
The cracks  averaged lower at $ 12.7/bbl during the year as compared  to $ 15.4/bbl in the previous year.
Naphtha cracks held  relatively stable during the first half of the FY 2013-14 amid  an increase in naphtha demand from Asian petrochemical  sector while the overall naphtha supply swelled.
Cracks  improved during the second half of the year on back of firm  petrochemical demand.
Freezing temperatures across US provided significant  support to light-ends during the winter period.
Material  increase in use of propane for heating in US resulted in  higher LPG prices globally.
This supported naphtha prices  as an alternate feedstock for crackers.
Fuel oil  Fuel Oil (FO) cracks were strong in the first quarter of FY  2013-14, due to restricted supply of blending components  to produce on-spec marine fuels.
Cracks were also  supported by reduction in Russian exports of Straight Run  Fuel Oil due to t he start of new upgrading capacities.
On  Port facility at Jamnagar 53 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports52 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... the demand side, teakettle refineries reduced throughput  and used crude as feedstock due to poor margins, capping  further gains.
However, FO cracks collapsed in the second  half of the year, on account of weak bunker demand in  Asia, higher stocks and below average Japanese power  sector demand.
Cracks improved marginally in January due  to seasonal winter demand, lower inflows from west and  improved demand as feedstock from teakettle refineries  ahead of Lunar New Year.
Subsequently, cracks have drifted  lower on flat bunker demand.
RIL is able to upgrade its heavy liquid products into higher  value products, and largely tends to benefit in weakness of  fuel oil as it lowers the prices of heavy crude oil.
Crude differentials A key determinant of complex refining margins has been  the differential between light and heavy crudes.
Arab   Light – Heavy crude differential widened to $ 4.2/bbl in  FY 2013-14 as compared to $ 3.6/bbl in the previous year.
Heavier crudes, particularly from Latin American sources  were also available at significantly higher differentials  during FY 2013-14 with incremental light oil supply in  North America.
While new refineries that are getting built  are increasingly complex and require heavy crudes as  feedstock, crude production increase is more on the lighter  side over the next few years supporting wider Light-Heavy  differentials in the coming years.
New refinery additions and expansions in existing refineries  were partly offset by closures in the US, Europe and Japan,  leading to a net capacity addition of about 0.9 MMBPD; oil  demand growth was higher at 1.3 MMBPD, with a reversal  of the declining trend in OECD demand witnessed over the  last three years.
These refinery closures also resulted in improved average  refinery utilisation rates in North America (84.8% in 2013  compared to 84.1% in 2012).
However, in Europe, utilisation  rates (76.4% compared to 79.8% in 2012) decreased due to  weak margins.
Asian operating rates were at 85.4%.

R&M segment had a record year with the highest ever  annual EBIT of ` 13,220 crore.
Gross Refining Margin (GRM)  averaging $ 8.1/bbl, as against $ 9.2/bbl in FY 2012-13.
EBIT  increased on account of stable middle distillate cracks,  improved light-heavy crude differentials and favourable  currency movement.
Though refining margins remained  weaker compared to last year, RIL performed significantly  better than the benchmark Singapore GRM which averaged  at $ 5.9/bbl during the year.
RIL refineries processed 68 MMT  of crude oil during the year, at an operating rate of 110%.
It  processed 10 new crude grades during the year, taking the  total number of crudes processed to 128.
Total exports of refined products reached $ 41.1 billion  during the year compared to $ 39.3 billion for the previous  year.
Overall, effective utilisation of secondary processing  units, innovative approach to optimise logistics cost and  utilisation, production flexibility to swing to higher net-back  products and sourcing of best value feed stock enabled RIL  to sustain its performance even in a challenging margin  environment.
Retail distribution network  GAPCO group owns and operates large storage facilities  and has a retail distribution network in Tanzania, Uganda,  Rwanda and Kenya.
It has significantly improved its standing  in the East African market and has emerged as a key supplier  to the neighbouring countries.
During 2013, 3.2 million Kilo  Litres (mkLs) of petroleum products were sold, up from 1.74  mkLs in 2012.
On the domestic retail side, nearly 300 retail outlets  are operational, mainly in Southern and Western India.
There have been some positive signs in the market, with   step-wise price deregulation, but resuming operations in all  geographies and scaling up of sales will be possible after  complete implementation of market determined prices for  gasoline and diesel.
Capex and growth plans Petcoke gasification project – utilising the “bottom  of barrel” One of RIL ’s key strategies, going forward, is setting up  the petcoke gasification project which is expected to put  RIL ’s energy and hydrogen costs at par or better than the  refineries in the US, where natural gas prices have fallen  dramatically with the shale revolution.
The project is  designed to deliver a step change reduction in energy costs,  substituting imported LNG with Coke /Coal.
The project is based on the “E-gas technology” (owned by  CB&I) and is currently in the execution stage.
Engineering  and Procurement activities are nearing completion and  construction activities are progressing rapidly.
Delivery of  key units has started at the site.
Construction of the petcoke  storage dome in Gasification complex is in the final stages  of completion.
RIL is aiming for a phased start-up of the  gasifiers.
Manpower resources and construction plans are  aligned to execute the project on schedule.
The coke gasification project is designed to run on both  coal and petcoke, giving RIL the flexibility to optimise based  on relative economics.
RIL is looking for various sourcing  options for petcoke from the refiners in India, Middle East  and North America.
RIL is also evaluating coal import  options from key coal exporting countries – Australia,  Indonesia and South Africa.
The gasification assets, delivered with Reliance’s project  execution capabilities, are expected to enhance its refining  profitability significantly.
This project is expected to make  RIL ’s energy costs competitive with the best in the industry.

PETROCHEMICALS RIL is one of the most integrated petrochemicals producers  globally, with operations ranging from the production of  feedstock and intermediates to end products in both the  polyester and polymer chain.
This vertical integration from  refining to petrochemical end products imparts RIL with  the fundamental strength of feedstock safety, scalability,  product diversification and economies of scale.
RIL has a balanced portfolio of naphtha and gas based  crackers, along with matching downstream capacities.
RIL ’s  petrochemical products portfolio includes polymers (PE, PP ,  PVC), fibre intermediates (PX, PTA, MEG), polyester products  (PFY, PSF, PET), elastomers and solvents.
The combination of world-scale capacity and deep  integration has a positive impact on the Company’s  operating margins and reduces exposure to the cyclicality  of markets and raw material prices.
The Company believes  that this strategy is also important in maintaining domestic  market leadership in its major product lines and is a source  of competitive advantage.
RIL constantly focuses on technology, cost improvements  and safe practices, whilst continuing to invest in high  growth opportunities.
Market Environment Olefins and Polymers  Ethylene is the base raw material used in manufacturing  of polymers like Polyethylene (PE), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  and polystyrene, and chemicals like ethylene oxide and  ethylene glycols.
The development of US shale gas reserves has had a  profound impact on the global chemical industry.
With  prices for ethane, the primary US ethylene feedstock,  down 60% versus its historical averages, the US is today  the second lowest cost region in the world to produce  chemicals (after the Middle East).
Today, 69% of US ethylene  is produced from ethane versus 17% from propane and 6%  from naphtha.
In contrast, Europe and Asia, which have  limited amounts of natural gas, developed as crude oil  based chemical producing regions.
Naphtha, a derivative of  crude oil, is the primary ethylene feedstock in these regions.
Global ethylene operating rates improved marginally to  85.8% in 2013, higher than the five-year average of 85.4%.
Ethylene prices and margins increased globally, supported  by stable crude oil and naphtha prices, along with tight  supply due to regional cracker turnarounds.
Asian ethylene  margins improved during the year led by firm PE demand,  despite high ethylene prices.

The current  expectation for incremental capacities in 2014 is 37% lower  as compared to early 2013 estimates of 7.3 MMTPA.
Major  project delays are largely in the North East Asian region.
The  global ethylene cycle is likely to stay strong over the next  3-4 years with the next major wave of capacity addition  (US shale gas based) expected from 2017-18.
This could  be further delayed due to engineering and construction  bottlenecks.
Even with key pieces of equipment likely to  be built offshore, availability of skilled labour is likely to  be a limiting factor for the rate and cost at which new US  ethylene capacity comes on-line.
The global thermoplastics market in 2013 was estimated at  208 MMT.
PE accounted for 39%, Polypropylene (PP) 27%  and PVC 19%, respectively, of the global thermoplastic  market.
Demand for these polymers (PE, PP , PVC) grew  by 3.4% during 2013 driven by North America, China and  marginal improvement in European market.
The demand  for these polymer products is likely to grow at CAGR of  approximately 4% over the next five year period.

Year-average deltas were positively impacted  as higher propylene inventories in the region and lower  downstream activity in China which kept feedstock prices  lower.
In 2014, propylene supply is expected to lengthen in  Asia as new crackers in China and Taiwan start production.
HDPE deltas improved significantly during the year from   $ 482/MT to $ 595/MT.
Deltas were strong due to firm  product prices with limited supply and range bound  naphtha prices.
Ethylene prices were higher due to lower  supply from South East Asia on account of heavy cracker  maintenance schedule.
Additionally, olefin shipments  from Middle East were limited due to port congestion and  start-up of downstream polymer units.
China’s drive for  self-sufficiency continues to reshape Asia’s olefin trade and  margin environment with increased regional availability.
However, the global ethylene cycle continues to be poised  favourably with operating rates likely to remain high to  meet demand growth.
PVC deltas declined (from $ 535/MT to $ 468/MT) as there  was substantial rise in EDC prices due to higher ethylene  prices on account of higher feedstock cost and tight supply.
EDC prices and supply were also affected by lower chlorine  availability in the US market (co-product chlorine was  impacted due to weak caustic markets) amidst rising US  PVC demand.
Globally, improvement in the US construction  sector is likely to enhance manufacturing activity and  demand for PVC-based products like profiles, among others.
Polyester and Fibre Intermediates Polyester markets faced challenges during the year as  capacity growth outpaced demand growth.
Despite price declines of 6-7%, downstream polyester deltas  were stable to marginally lower than last year on account  of lower feedstock costs.
Higher cotton price (up 6% y-o-y)  was also a major factor during the year, as it led to widening  of the price differential in favour of polyester.
Amongst the downstream polyester products, PET had a  relatively better year.
The global overcapacity has forced a  few large producers to shut operations at some sites in USA  and Europe.
Heavy rationalisation of operations resulted  in steady prices during the year, and supported higher  margins of $ 221/MT against $ 171/MT in the previous year.
Polyester markets are expected to witness capacity growth  in excess of demand growth.
These excess capacities are  likely to impact operating rates and profitability.
Polyester  producers having presence in end products and fibre  intermediates are relatively better placed due to integrated  chain economics.
Across western economies demand improved, but it was  still marked by discretionary buying and cautious optimism.
Asia’s share in global consumption stands at 37%.
China  accounts for 30% of the global capacity and 55% of the  global capacity growth of 2.8 MMT in 2013.
Recycled PET usage growth almost halved with only North  America witnessing stable growth.
PET markets are likely to  witness higher capacity growth over demand, which may  result in softening of deltas.
The key consuming sector –  beverages – is sensitive to discretionary spending trends  and weather, which could have an adverse impact on  consumption.

The margins declined from the previous year as  naphtha prices remained firm, and acceptability of PX prices  by the strained PTA sector remained weak, amidst divergent  views about the impact of the impending new capacity  start-up.
Large-scale PX capacity expansions are planned  for 2014.
However many of the new capacities are based  on high cost feedstock such as heavy condensate, heavy  naphtha and mixed xylenes which would impair operations,  leaving primarily the integrated and the low cost based  operations with a competitive advantage.
High industry capacity impacted prices and margins for PTA,  which for most part of the year remained below break-even  levels, exerting severe pressure on operating economics.
PTA capacity growth is expected to continue to surpass  demand growth, albeit at a slower rate.
Plant operations  not falling under the top two quartiles of cost curve would  continue to witness rationalisation, either as shut downs or  lower operating rates.
Operating rates are likely to remain  low; however, margins could improve as increased supply  of PX will ease price pressure.
MEG markets were balanced with a capacity growth of 1.5  MMT against a demand growth of 1.2 MMT in 2013.
Average  prices and margins remained stable and operating rates  were slightly higher at 82%.
Though markets remained  balanced, it was subject to speculation and polyester buyers  resorted to holding lower stocks along with co-feedstock  PTA.
Chinese port stocks increased steadily during the  year, reaching around 1 MMT at year end.
This increase  pressurised margins, pulling them below the five-year  average.
MEG markets are expected to maintain a stable  operating rate.
Chemicals and Elastomers  During the year, the global chemical business scenario was  mixed with high feedstock prices and low demand growth;  but with low capacity addition.
In the elastomers segment globally, the auto industry is  going through a difficult period, which is impacting PBR,  SBR and Butyl rubber consumption.
With Asia’s subdued  demand and major capacity additions, margins remained  under pressure.
In FY 2013-14, the Indian auto sector  contracted for the first time in the last decade, which  impacted, the primary consumer of synthetic rubbers.
Benzene:  Globally, benzene markets remained tight,  supporting margins above their five-year average level.
Margins for the year averaged at $ 400/MT, around 9%  higher y-o-y.
Although margins remained healthy, global  operating rates were around 66% with a production of 44  MMT during 2013.
Raw material shortage in the US and  Europe and poor refinery economics impacted benzene  production.
The demand from styrene sector (accounting  for 50% of Benzene demand) remained firm.
Asian operating  rates remained healthy, and the region was a major exporter  to other markets.
Domestic consumption was almost flat as  no new major consumption unit was commissioned.
Benzene markets are likely to witness a capacity growth  of 2.5 MMTPA, mostly in Asia and US benzene demand is  expected to recover in alignment with its economic revival.
Increasing use of light feedstock (shale gas) is likely to limit  feedstock availability for benzene production, resulting in  tight supply and firm prices.
Butadiene:  In 2013, butadiene global capacity was 13.4  MMT with 78% operating rate.
Demand grew at 3% based on  the previous year driven by PBR, Styrene Butadiene Rubber  (SBR), ABS and SB Latex, primarily catering to automobile  industry.
SBR and PBR markets in Asia have had a poor run last year  and demand is yet to recover.

This has put pressure on butadiene prices; on a Y-o-Y  basis butadiene price have fallen by around 30% in the  region.
There has been no corresponding fall in butadiene  feedstock prices; which has led to erosion in margin for  butadiene manufacturers.
Indian butadiene demand grew by 3% to 116 KTA as against  capacity of 300 KTA, making it a net exporter in the global  markets.
Domestic demand growth is expected to increase  due to the start-up of new synthetic rubber plants planned  for in the near future.
Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB):  LAB is mostly consumed as  surfactant intermediate for detergents.
Global LAB capacity  is around 3.8 MMTPA with 85% capacity utilisation.
While the  global demand growth is at 2%, for Asia it is 5%, indicating  emergence of Asia as a key LAB consumption region.
Middle  Eastern countries have a very limited domestic LAB market  whilst India being at close proximity becomes their natural  export market.
This allows for low priced imports to be  available in the country.
The current Indian LAB capacity is 520 KTA while the overall  demand is of around 500 KT.
LAB demand in India grew by  2.5% during the year.
Additional capacity expansions in  Saudi Arabia and China as well as renewed availability of  Iranian material are expected to put pressure on domestic  LAB manufacturers.
Polybutadiene Rubber (PBR):  PBR is used mainly in the  automobile sector.
Global PBR consumption for FY 2013-14  remained weak due to lower off-take from the automobile  sector.
There was significant capacity addition in China  during 2013, which, coupled with the slowdown in global  economy kept the operating rates of PBR plants at lower  levels (approximately 72%).
Major manufacturers in China  and Korea operated at even lower rates of 50-60% due to  weak regional demand.
During FY 2013-14, automobile sales in India excluding  2-wheelers witnessed de-growth.
Despite this slowdown,  PBR consumption in India increased by 8% due to strong  demand from the replacement market.
Indian Petrochemical market Polymers: The Indian polymer market growth is closely  linked to GDP growth.
The Indian per capita plastic  consumption is advancing at 1.5 times its GDP growth  making India among the world’s fastest growing polymer  markets with a five-year CAGR of 10.7% (2008-2013).
Despite  strong growth over last few decades, the Indian market  remains under-penetrated.
Increasing industrialisation  and stable economy is likely to propel India’s per capita  consumption of polymers.
During FY 2013-14, polymer demand in India grew by 3%.
This was driven by 5% growth in PP , 2% growth in PVC and  1% growth in PE demand.
Petrochemical demand growth in  India during FY 2013-14 was low compared to last 5 and 10  year average growth rates.
The lower demand growth can  be attributed to economic slowdown, deferment of capital  expenditure by the government on infrastructure, currency  volatility and liquidity crunch caused by higher interest  rates.
Overall, PP demand was moderately higher as there was  growth in some of the end-use packaging applications.
However, PP demand was negatively affected by poor  demand from cement packaging and automobile sector.
In PVC market, pipe demand was flat due to extended  monsoon and high inventory of finished goods.
During  the year, India imported around 1 MMT of PVC in line  with previous year’s imports.
Overall, PE demand was soft  as end-use sector consumption was affected by slower  growth in infrastructure, fertilizer sectors and roto-moulded  products.
PVC domestic demand growth during 2013-18 is  expected to be at 6.7% CAGR.
However, long-term growth  prospects are positive on account of the government’s  focus on infrastructure development and low per capita  consumption.
During the year, 0.7 MMTPA of polymer capacity was added  in India (mainly in PP and PVC).

During the same  period, around 3.5 MMTPA of total polymer capacity is likely  to be added, including RIL ’s on-going capacity expansions.
Polyester:  Indian all fibre textile mill consumption in 2013  was estimated at 9 MMT, 7% up over previous year.
Of this,  cotton and polyester are major textile fibres consumed,  and account for almost 90% of all fibre consumed.
In India,  the current share of cotton and man-made fibre demand  is around 55:45 compared to around 35:65 globally.
Indian  all fibre demand is expected to reach a market size of  around 13 MMT by 2020 and 17.5 MMT by 2030.
India is  ideally positioned to see an impressive stage of growth  with favourable demographics and dependent population  rate growing slower than the workforce.
In line with global  trends this would pave the way for larger man-made fabric  base, benefiting the polyester industry at large.
The domestic polyester industry witnessed mixed market  sentiments during FY 2013-14, reflecting an overall  moderate and cautious growth pattern.
During the year,  domestic polyester demand grew by 6% on y-o-y basis, led  by 7% growth in PFY, 6% growth in PET and 2% growth in  PSF.
The first quarter of the year witnessed healthy demand  growth for all polyester variants due to seasonal upturn and  active restocking activities.
However, in the second quarter  of the fiscal, the polyester demand turned cautious amidst  volatility in the feedstock prices and the Indian Rupee.
Fully Drawn Yarn (FDY) markets, however, witnessed  good growth due to import substitution and growing  applications in warp knits and embroidery segments.
PET  market growth was stunted owing to the longer monsoons  and prolonged winter, while PSF growth was affected due  to the replacement by recycled fibres and filament yarns in  certain market segments.
During FY 2013-14, Indian textile and clothing exports  increased by 14% y-o-y.
Textile industry-friendly policies  and schemes were announced by the GoI and several states  to encourage the sector’s value-addition and growth.

Capex and growth plans India’s PE demand in 2013 was 3.5 MMT and is projected  to grow at 6-8% annually.
The market remains supply- constrained whilst higher domestic availability and new  applications are expected to augment demand.
Last year,  India imported 1.3 MMT of PE to meet rising demand.
Reliance is expanding PE capacity by 1 MMTPA at Jamnagar.
In addition, to help meet the growing needs of polyester  business, Reliance is setting up a world scale MEG plant  at Jamnagar.
These state-of-the-art technology plants will  be supplied ethylene from a new cracker being built at the  63 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports62 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... same site.
The new cracker has a capacity of 1.4 MMTPA and  will use refinery off gases as feedstock.
This is likely to be  among the world’s largest ethylene crackers and will reap  the benefits of economies of scale.
Additionally, by virtue  of complex integration with Company’s existing refineries  at the same site, the plant will be in the top quartile in  terms of global cost competitiveness.
Currently, significant  construction activity is underway at the site and long-lead  items have been ordered.
RIL is undertaking de-bottlenecking activities for PP at  Jamnagar and for PVC at Dahej.
RIL is undertaking a large expansion across the polyester  value chain, taking advantage of feedstock linkages and  domestic market growth.
During the year, RIL commissioned  one of the most automated PFY facilities in the world  at Silvassa.
The commissioning of this facility marks the  beginning of the mega petrochemical expansion of RIL.
Other expansions in the polyester chain include 2.3 MMTPA  of PTA 2.3 MMTPA of PX and 0.6 MMTPA of PET which are  progressing as per scheduled timelines and are expected to  be commissioned in phases over the next two years.
With  these expansions, RIL is expected to emerge as the third  largest producer of PTA and the second largest producer  of PX in the world.
With the coordination in expansion  of feedstock and downstream polyester products, the  feedstock security and consumption markets have been  addressed, and RIL will continue to benefit from the chain  delta economics.
All expansions are world scale and use  state-of-the-art technology which ensures advantageous  cost of operations alongside savings in packaging and  logistic costs.
Being strategically located close to the  consumption centres, allows for easy access and benefits  the targeted markets with an economical and reliable  source of raw materials.
The surplus capacity in the intermediates business has  impacted both prices and margins in the past year.
However  with the economy and consumption being at the bottom  of down-cycle, RIL start-ups would be ideally placed at a  time when demand would emerge.
In addition to this the  limited exposure to externalities would sheath the impacts  allowing maximum benefits in the integrated chain.
The petrochemical capacity additions are aimed at serving  growing Indian consumption and will further strengthen  RIL ’s leadership position in the domestic market.
The new SBR project (150 KTPA) and PBR project (40 KTPA)  are progressing well and are expected to commence  production in FY 2014-15.
Additionally, RIL has broken  ground for its 100 KTPA butyl rubber facility in partnership  with Sibur at Jamnagar.
This is a significant step towards  the Company’s commitment to service India’s growing  automotive sector by bringing in complex technologies.
OIL AND GAS EXP LORATION AND  PRODUCTION BU SINESS Market environment and outlook  Crude oil 2013 witnessed a rebound in global oil demand, which  increased by 1.3 MMBPD, tracking the economic recovery  in the US and Europe.
Supply concerns in Libya, South  Sudan, West Africa and Iraq were offset by higher US shale  oil production resulting in Brent crude oil prices averaging  marginally lower at $ 108.7/ barrel (bbl) during 2013 as  compared to $ 111.6/bbl in 2012.
During the year 2013,  the US emerged as the second largest producer of crude  oil behind Russia as a consequence of higher shale oil  production.
The success story of shale was driven by the  policy of free market pricing of gas, mineral rights vested  with land owners and excellent rail/pipeline infrastructure  to evacuate gas and liquids.
Petrochemical  Investment 1.4 MMTPA refinery off-gas cracker  to be among the world’s  largest ethylene crackers Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 65 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports64 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... As the underlying economic fundamentals for the global  economy maintain their momentum, oil demand in 2014 is  expected to increase by 1.3 MMBPD (Source: IEA), keeping  prices range bound.
Oil markets entered 2014 with the  lowest commercial oil inventories in over twenty years, for  the three major OECD markets — US, Europe and Japan.
Spare capacity is also low and largely concentrated in the  Middle East whilst incremental supply is likely to be driven  by US crude production.
Oversupply of light sweet crude in  the US Gulf Coast market has pushed out US imports of Oil,  effectively disconnecting Brent prices from WTI/LLS prices.
In the US market, crude oil production growth is expected to  remain strong, primarily concentrated in the Bakken, Eagle  Ford and Permian regions.
EIA forecasts the US production  to increase from 7.4 MMBPD in 2013 to 9.1 MMBPD by 2015.
WTI crude prices remain strong in view of geo-political  tensions and continuous reduction in Cushing inventories.
US natural gas The importance of natural gas is expected to grow  considerably owing to abundant supply, competitive supply  costs vis-à-vis liquid fuels and environmental advantages  over other fossil fuels.
Since the turn of the century, global  gas use has expanded on average by 2.7% annually – faster  than oil or nuclear energy.
In the US markets also, the growth in natural gas production  is likely to continue in the near term, driven by sustained  growth in rich gas or associated gas of liquid area.
US  natural gas production grew by 1.2% y-o-y in 2013 reaching  a level of 66.53 B CF / D. Growing domestic production over  the past several years has displaced some pipeline imports  from Canada, while exports to Mexico have increased.
EIA  projects United States to be net exporter of gas beginning  in 2018.
The market has responded to this growth by adding  processing capacities and other necessary infrastructure   for gas.
Gas prices in the US market, which are quite sensitive to  weather have seen strengthening over last three years.
A  warmer than normal 2011/12 winter resulted in gas prices  to average $ 2.83/MMBTU in 2012, but the severe 2013/14  winter (the 3 rd  coldest winter on record) resulted in a sharp  increase in gas prices.
Supported by low gas storage levels,  prices are sustaining levels of $ 4.50 to $ 5.00/MMBTU and  this is reflected in analysts’ price estimate outlook for 2014.
Supply chain As per research estimates, global E&P capital expenditure  will grow from around $ 451 billion in 2013 to reach $ 656  billion by 2020.
Out of the current capex figure, nearly $ 127  billion is earmarked for offshore development and this is  expected to touch $ 224 billion by 2020.
Demand is picking  up in regions including North America (unconventional),  East Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
Of these,  Asia and the Middle East are amongst the fastest growing  regions in the world for upstream capital expenditure and  account for nearly 27% of all the upstream expenditure in  the world.
Availability of rigs, particularly deepwater rigs  remained constrained, and day rates stayed firm.
The industry also suffers from manpower shortages and  currently has a high level of vacancies in key disciplines and  is confronted with an expertise gap.
Market environment - India India’s gas demand is expected to treble over the next  decade, rising from 150 million metric standard cubic  metre per day (MMSCMD) to exceed 517 MMSCMD by 2022  (Source: PNGRB).
This demand escalation would be driven  by multiple factors: environmental concerns, convenience  of use and cost advantage over other fossil fuels.
Indian LNG imports are also expected to increase three- fold by around 2020.
Currently, India imports 34% of its gas  needs at prices indexed to oil.
Indian LNG prices are likely to  be indexed to oil for the foreseeable future, driven by global  benchmarks and higher costs of new projects in Australia  and East Africa.
According to the IEA, to meet energy security needs, India  needs upstream investment of nearly $ 176 billion from  2013 to 2035.
This implies an annual investment of about  $ 8 billion.
The IHS CERA estimates (issued in April 2013) show that  nearly 91 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas in India’s basins can  be unlocked at $ 12+ per MMBTU.
An enabling regulatory  environment and a regime for free market pricing may  facilitate enhanced investments and a robust energy  security landscape.
As part of the tr ansition towards free market pricing, during  the year, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)  approved a new gas pricing formula for a period of five  FPSO, KG-D6 Block 65 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports64 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... 100 80 60 40 20 0 Indian Gas Resource Potential 91 TCF of gas resource can be unlocked  at price of $ 12+ per MMBTU  8 10 12 12+ Gas price in $/MMBTU TCF 30 55 80 91 years based on the recommendation of the Rangarajan  Committee Report on “the Production Sharing Contract  Mechanism in Petroleum Industry” .
The Domestic Natural  Gas Pricing Guideline, 2014 has been notified by the  Government which will be applicable to all natural gas  produced domestically, irrespective of source.
Oil & Gas business and competitive  position RIL ’s upstream business covers the complete chain of activity  starting from acquisition to exploration, development  and production.
The Company has a balanced portfolio of  conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resource  plays with significant presence in deep-water blocks off the  East Coast of India and US shale regions of Eagle Ford and  Marcellus.
Partnerships represent an important dimension of the E&P  business.
RIL and its partners channelise expertise and  work closely together to target high quality prospects and  optimise existing and future development plans.
RIL has gained significant experience and expertise in  conventional deepwater drilling and horizontal drilling  in North America’s shale plays.
A large repository of data  acquired over the last two decades of exploration and  development supports an extensive knowledge base  gathered through consistent investment in technology  and people.
Leveraging this database and experience, the  Company has re-organised and restructured the upstream  business into three distinct sectors - Conventional, Coal Bed  Methane (CBM) and Shale Gas.
Such an initiative ensures  that the sectoral risks and dynamics are clearly understood  and separately managed to maximise value and growth.

Expanding resource base through successful  exploration initiatives  RIL along with JV partners made two significant hydrocarbon  discoveries in FY 2013 -14, i.e.
Discovery (D-55) in well MJ1  drilled in the block KG-D6 situated in the Krishna Godavari  basin and Discovery (D-56) in exploration block CY-D5  situated in the Cauvery basin.
Discovery D-55 – Discovery in development area of  block KG-D6 (D1-D3 field): The KG-D6-MJ1 well was drilled  in a water depth of 1,024 metres, and to a total depth of  4,509 metres, to explore the prospects of a Mesozoic Synrift  Clastic reservoir, lying over 2,000 metres below the already  producing reservoirs in the D1-D3 gas fields.
Formation  evaluation indicates a gross gas and condensate column in  the well of about 155 metres in the Mesozoic reservoirs.
In  drill stem testing, the well flowed at 30.6 million standard  cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) and 2,121 Barrels of Oil per  Day (BOPD).
The discovery, named ‘D-55’ , has been notified  to the GoI.
Discovery D-56 – Discovery in block CY-D5:  As part of the  minimum work program in this block, exploratory well CY- III-D5-S1 which was drilled in a water depth of 1,743 metres,  to a total depth of 5,731 metres, with the primary objective  of exploring Mesozoic-aged reservoirs has resulted in gas  condensate discovery.
The formation evaluation indicated a  gross gas and condensate column in the well of about 143  metres in the Mesozoic-aged reservoirs.
In drill stem testing, the well flowed at 35.2 MMSCFD and  413 BOPD.
The discovery, named ‘D-56’ , has been notified  to the GoI.
This is the second discovery in the block which  will enable scope for integration of all discoveries for early  monetisation.
Portfolio management During the year, as part of on-going portfolio management,  RIL has relinquished 4 exploration blocks including KG- DWN-2004/4, MN-DWN-2004/1, MN-DWN-2004/2 and KG- DWN-2005/2.
Progress towards next wave of development projects KG-D6 R-Cluster Development: Management Committee approval  for the Field Development Plan (FDP) has been received.
This is part of the next wave of projects in KG-D6 with  ultimate recoverable reserves of around 1.2-1.4 TCF.
The  expected gas production rate will be in the range of 12  MMSCMD, significantly increasing utilisation of existing  KG-D6 facilities.
As part of the development activity, the  Concept and FEED have been completed and the sourcing,  contracting for the long lead items for the projects have also  been initiated.
Appraisal of MJ1 discovery As part of the appraisal program, the first appraisal well  was successfully drilled.
It has encountered approximately  130 meters of hydrocarbon column.
For effective reservoir  characterisation, a high end seismic activity was completed.
Based on current understanding, this discovery is a material  one and all efforts are being made to accelerate the  commerciality assessment of this significant discovery for  expeditious monetisation.
Satellite / Other Satellite discoveries Since the approval of Optimized Field Development Plan  (OFDP) for 4 Satellite discoveries, the JV, based on drilling  of development well and D1-D3 field performance has re-  calibrated the reservoir models.
With respect to the Other Satellite discoveries (D29,  D30 & D31), the Declaration of Commerciality (DOC) is  pending with Management Committee for review awaiting  resolution on Drill Stem Testing (DST) issue.
The JV has  already submitted a proposal to do DST in the wells and is  hopeful of an early resolution of the issue.
Meanwhile, JV has undertaken Concept updation,  Geotechnical, Geophysical & Geohazard Surveys and Front  End Engineering Design (FEED).
With the purpose of efficiently developing these  Discoveries an integrated scheme of development is being  conceptualised.

Production volumes for the year were lower  on account of geological complexity, natural decline in the  fields and higher than envisaged water ingress.
This decline  is partially offset by additional gas production from the new  development well MA-08.
As a part of the CBM development programme, RIL is drilling  more than 200 wells and setting up two Gas Gathering  Stations and 8 Water Gathering Stations in Phase-I.
The  land acquisition is at an advanced stage – more than 50%  of Phase-1 scope has been completed.
Currently 3 rigs are  in operation with drilling and completion activities having  commenced from November 2013.
RIL has drilled 90 surface  and 72 production holes and 51 hydro fracturing jobs have  been completed.
Concept and FEED for Surface Facilities is  completed and Detailed Engineering is underway.
Shahdol – Phulpur gas pipeline project Petroleum And Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has  issued the Grant of Authorisation in June 2013 to Reliance  Gas Pipeline Limited, a subsidiary of RIL, for a natural gas  pipeline from Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh to Phulpur in  Uttar Pradesh (hook-up point with GAIL ’s HVJ pipeline) to  transport gas from RIL ’s CBM blocks.
Land acquisition has been completed for all critical  installations and obtaining of Right of Use (ROU) for laying  the pipeline is under way.
Basic engineering (FEED) is  completed and detailed engineering is in progress.
Ordering  for long lead items has been completed and awarding of  construction contract is in the final stages.
Measures taken for sustaining production from  existing fields As part of multiple initiatives to sustain production  and enhance recovery from the D1-D3 and MA fields,   RIL successfully drilled and completed a development  well MA-08 in MA field and commenced production from  January 2014.
This has resulted in additional gas production  of approximately 2.2 MMSCMD.
Other enhanced gas recovery projects underway include:    i) water shut off jobs and side track activities in the existing  shut in wells, and ii) Engineering and construction activities  for booster compression – target completion in 2015.
Panna-Mukta JV The Panna-Mukta JV carried out significant drilling activities  during the current year, drilling six wells in the PL area  and six infill wells in the PJ and PG areas.
These activities  yielded additional volume that helped in partially arresting  production decline.
As part of the Mukta field development, the Joint  venture submitted and received approval for Mukta “B”  development from the Management Committee.
The  estimated recoverable reserves from Mukta “B” area is  approximately 3.56 MMBBL of oil and 9.16 BCF of gas during  the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) period.
First oil from  this development is expected in FY 2015-16.

The decrease  in the production volumes for the year was due to a   17-day shutdown for field maintenance activities including  commissioning of new SPM system coupled with natural  decline.
The Tapti field delivered 0.3 MMBBL of condensate  and 27.3 BCF of natural gas in FY 2013-14; 48% and 38%  declines in condensate and natural gas respectively.
The  decrease was due to the under-performance of new wells,  as well as the natural decline in reserves.
During the year, the Tapti field witnessed lower production  from the existing wells due to natural decline.
Also, the  results of the new infill wells drilled were not encouraging.
Consequent to this, JV re-assessed the reserve estimates  through an independent consultant and revised the  ultimate recoverable reserves.
The JV is preparing for  abandonment of this field in consultation with GoI.
International business In line with its strategy of portfolio balancing by expanding  its international asset base and investing in regimes having  attractive internationally competitive terms, RIL participated  in the Myanmar bid round.
RIL was selected for two offshore blocks (M17 and M18)  located in offshore Myanmar in water depths up to 3,000 ft  and together encompassing an area of 27,600 sq.

North American Shale Gas – Operations Background The successful shale gas revolution in North America has  changed the global energy landscape.
Industry continues to  discover new plays and operators continue to find economic  ways of exploiting this resource.
The US market is business  friendly and actionable with an abundance of financing  options that make it possible for leaner and smaller players  to gain a position of importance in the market.
RIL has leveraged its cost leadership experience in its shale  joint ventures and with its truly global outlook has quickly  become a sustainable and a major shale gas player.
Reliance  has, till date, invested $ 7.0 billion in its joint ventures with  Pioneer Natural Resources, Carrizo and Chevron.

JV.
The overall capex during the year was $ 1.4 billion, lower  by 35% over the previous year on account of reduced carry  obligations and moderated development pace at Marcellus.
Several initiatives were taken up to ensure sustainable  growth of the business by increasing resource recovery,  reducing costs and higher productivity.
New development  concepts such as down spaced wells, drilling in upper  Eagle Ford and upper Marcellus were pursued.
These  will positively impact reserve accretion as well.
Cost and  recovery optimisation initiatives like multi well-pad drilling  and longer laterals were successfully pursued.
In CY 2013, the RIL-Shale Gas Operations (RIL-SGO) posted a  43% reserve accretion with year-end proved reserves at 2.66  TCFe.
These Proved reserves are about 30% of total resource  base underscoring significant development upside.
Reserves were positively impacted by benefits of additional  well locations in Pioneer and Carrizo joint ventures marking  development upside.
During 2013, the joint ventures drilled 252 wells and put  237 wells on production taking the cumulative number of  producing wells to 622 at the end of the year as compared to  385 producing wells at the end of 2012.
Reliance witnessed  an improvement in efficiencies and cost reductions in  development activities for 2013 over the previous year.
The  focus was on leveraging knowledge on acreage sweet spots  and preserving optionality on dry gas acreage.

Pioneer Upstream JV JV has been notably successful in pursuing high   value growth.
Producing well count increased from 246 at  year-end 2012 to 371 at year-end 2013, which was a major  factor in the growth in production volumes.
The JV produced  207 BCFe of products through the year (gross) and achieved  an exit rate of 662 MMCFeD.
The share of liquids increased to  64% in 2013 reflecting growth in activity in oil-rich acreage.
On-going development thrust on infill drilling, down spaced  and upper Eagle Ford development provided for additional  potential locations leading to growth in proved reserves by  34% at year-end 2013.
Chevron Upstream JV The JV saw production growing over 100% from previous  year at 91 BCFe and achieved an exit rate of 328 MMCFeD.
The JV witnessed impressive growth in proved reserves  going up 79% from year-end 2012 to year-end 2013.
JV is  pursuing paced development in view of the challenging  pricing environment while retaining optionality on acreages  through low cost lease renewals.
Carrizo Upstream JV In view of a challenging price differential environment,  Carrizo JV deferred bringing some wells online as per  original schedule which led to curtailment in production.
In  spite of this, the JV production of 40 BCFe reflected a 78%  increase over the previous year and the JV achieved an exit  rate of 138 MMCFeD at the end of 2013.
Carrizo JV focused  on portfolio optimisation through the sale of suboptimal  acreage in Sullivan County in the fourth quarter of CY 2013.
While year-end 2013 reserves were largely unchanged,  Carrizo added potential well locations due to Upper  Marcellus development plan down spacing.
Update on domestic gas pricing,  arbitration and other legal issues Domestic Gas Pricing The Contractor was entitled to a revised gas price from  1st April 2014.
The government notified “The Domestic  Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014” on 10 th January 2014.
The  notification required the Government to intimate quarterly  prices on the basis of the approved formula.
In view of  the Model Code of Conduct which is in place for the  Parliamentary Elections, the Government approached the  Election Commission for permission prior to notifying the  applicable process for quarter 1 st April to 30 th June 2014.
The Election Commission has advised after taking into  account all relevant facts that the intimation of the price  of gas sales for the quarter be deferred.
In view of the  Election Commission recommendation, the MoPNG has  directed the Contractor to continue to charge the earlier  prices even after 1 st April 2014.
Accordingly, the Contractor  is selling gas to its customers at the price of $ 4.2/ MMBTU,  on a provisional basis.
The Contractor is entitled under the  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 71 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports70 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... PSC to receive market prices for all gas produced and sold  from the block.
The restriction on charging the revised gas  price is not in line with the PSC and the Contractor reserves  its rights and remedies to claim the revised gas price from   1 st April 2014.
KG-D6 Arbitration and other legal issues RIL has commenced an arbitration against the Government’s  decision to disallow recovery of costs incurred by the  Contractor in the development of facilities constructed for  production of gas from the D1 and D3 fields in the block  KG-D6.
RIL approached the Supreme Court for appointment  of a third arbitrator following the failure on the part of  the arbitrators appointed by the Contractor and the  Government to appoint a third arbitrator.
Consequently, the  third arbitrator has been appointed by the Supreme Court.
Public Interest Litigations (PIL) were filed by Gurudas  Dasgupta and an NGO called Common Cause before the  Supreme Court.
The PILs primarily seek quashing of the  decisions of the Government to revise the gas price and  action against the Contractor for failure to relinquish area  and for hoarding gas.
As both the PILs raised substantially  the same claims, the Supreme Court tagged both the  petitions to be heard together.
These PIL are currently being  heard by the Supreme Court.
PMT Arbitration Arbitration Hearing took place in London from   19 th  November to 27 th  November 2013 and a number  of issues (including Interpretation of Cost recovery  provisions, interpretation of provision related to calculation  of Investment Multiple and profit sharing, Powers and  functions of Management Committee and method of  determining the amount of royalty) were heard and  award has been reserved.
A final hearing has been fixed  for 15 th  June to 3 rd  July 2015.
Further RIL/BG’s SLP before  the Supreme Court (challenging Delhi High Court’s order  admitting GoI’s petition for setting aside a partial final award  handed down by PMT arbitration tribunal) has been heard  by the Supreme Court and the judgment has been reserved.
Major Subsidiaries RETAIL BUSINESS Market environment India’s economy has been plagued by persistent slowdown  since 2012.
Combination of domestic and global factors  are responsible for the downturn.
Spiralling inflation and  rising interest rates over the past few years have subdued  both investment and consumption in the economy.
Global  downturn also cast its shadow, making consumers cautious  in their spending behaviour.
Discretionary spending among urban consumers was also  impacted by escalating food prices.
Growth in private final  consumption expenditure (PFCE) of 2.5% in 3Q of FY 2013- 14 (2Q FY 2013-14: 3%) was the second lowest growth  observed in the last 37 quarters.
(Source: Central Statistics  Office – 3 rd  Quarter GDP Estimates, February 28, 2014).
The result is a bleak domestic scenario in which consumer  confidence and business optimism have remained below  expectations.
India’s Retail industry, estimated at over $ 500 billion in  2012 (Source: Deloitte – Indian Retail Market Opening More  Doors, January 2013), has evolved considerably in the last  few years.
However, organised retail is still in its infancy  stage with 12 million kirana shops strengthening the  sector’s backbone.
While modern retail is resilient to economic cycles owing  to its fundamental growth drivers, improvements in the  overall consumer sentiment will drive industry growth in  the foreseeable future.
Organised retail will help accelerate  India’s economic growth and job creation.
During the year, developments on the policy front provided  an opportunity for global retailers to make investments and  participate in the sector’s growth story.
Outlook A two trillion dollar economy catering to a billion-plus  population, more than half of which is below the age of 30.
Such a scenario, a rarity in the world’s demographic profile,  represents the foundation for India’s retail sector growth.
India’s organised retail is witnessing a new surge of  optimism and is projected to touch a 20% share of the total  retail market by 2020 vis-à-vis 8% now.

Reliance Digital continued to refine the ReConnect range  of the own-label brand.
It included new products and  categories to suit all budgets and requirements.
During the  year, the most notable achievement has been the launch  of ReConnect LED televisions in collaboration with Harman  Kardon.
ReConnect contributed up to 18% penetration for  several CDIT product families representing steady increase  in the own label penetration.
Digital format sector continued its rapid expansion during  the year.
It added over 140 stores to its tally of 139 stores at  the beginning of the year.
Brands During the year, Reliance Brands through its joint venture  with Iconix USA, Iconix Lifestyle India, made available three  well-known international brands viz; London Fog, Umbro  and Cannon for discerning Indian consumers.
The business added Quiksilver ( www.quiksilver.in) to its  e-commerce portfolio, supplementing the earlier launch of  Stevemadden (www.stevemadden.in) Hamleys, the experiential toys retailing format, added 5  stores to its portfolio during the year.
It is now the largest  franchised operation of the London-based iconic retailer.
Widening its store network of brands already in its portfolio,  Reliance Brands opened the first stores for Dune and Stuart  Weitzman during the year.
Jewellery During the year, jewellery demand remained sluggish  owing to weak macro environment, sticky inflation and poor  consumer sentiment.
Unfavourable regulatory landscape  also led to volatility in gold prices.
Regulatory changes  severely curtailed gold imports, resulting in scarcity and  spiralling cost of imported gold.
The inevitable outcome  was higher gold prices and weak consumer demand.
Reliance Jewels was focused on consolidating operations of  its portfolio of over 50 stores.
The objective was to improve  its performance against various operational parameters and  build a robust growth platform.
Several new product lines  were introduced during the year.
Relaxation of control on gold imports and reduction in  import duty shall be the key growth catalysts in the coming  period.
Growth plans Format developments Offerings in the portfolio were consistently re-evaluated  and as a result some key developments were witnessed: a) In line with emerging scenarios, the business withdrew  its offering of TimeOut in the books and music category.
The books and music industry is undergoing consistent  evolution catalysed by technology and the way  consumers perceive these categories in a technology- driven era.
Reliance Retail recognised the growing influence  of electronic information media on this category.
Therefore, Reliance Retail realigned its offerings in  this segment and discontinued the books and music  format.
b) Another key development at Reliance Retail during the  year was the discontinuation of the non-vegetarian  food offering, ‘Delight’ , echoing consumer sentiments.
Reliance Retail is in a unique position to capitalise on the  growing opportunity in India.
Continued expansion is the  way ahead.
The roadmap is clear -- it will be achieved by  growing in existing markets and foraying into unexplored  markets.
The objective is simple, ‘Elevating Lives and  Rekindling Aspirations’ , for all Indians.
The business is poised to launch multi-channel shopping in  the coming year.
The potential of e-commerce combined  with the network of physical store locations will offer  tremendous choice and convenience at a great value to the  consumer.
Digital sector would be one of the growth verticals for the  coming year.
Expansion of Digital Express Mini format to  newer geographies that represents potential for mobility  devices would be a priority for the Company.
To augment  this growth, ResQ would expand its presence and enable  Reliance Digital Express store Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 77 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports76 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... more and more consumers to experience and benefit from  the interplay of communication and technology.
Reliance Market would remain a priority for network  expansion as it continues to empower the kiranas and helps  the farmers and small manufacturers to benefit from the  modern distribution system.

However, the growth in broadband connections has not  been commensurate with the enormous growth of India’s  telecommunication industry.
India has only around 14.5  million broadband (Source: TRAI) connections, excluding  internet access by wireless phone subscribers, which is very  low compared to other European and Asian countries.
Spectrum acquisition and infrastructure tie  ups RIL ’s subsidiary, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited(RJIL) is  the only private player with Broadband Wireless Access  (BWA) spectrum in all the 22 telecom circles of India, plans  to provide reliable fast internet connectivity through  the 20 MHz, contiguous, pan-India BWA spectrum.
In  addition, in the recently concluded spectrum auctions,  RJIL successfully acquired 1800 MHz spectrum across 14  key circles to strengthen in-building coverage in LTE.
In  addition to connectivity, RJIL also plans to enable end-to- end solutions that address the entire value chain across  various digital services in key domains of national interest  such as, education, healthcare, security, financial services,  government-citizen interfaces and entertainment.
In  October 2013, RJIL received Unified License for all 22 service  areas across India and became the first telecom operator  in the country to get pan India Unified License.
The license  allows RJIL to offer all telecom services including voice  telephony under a single license.
RJIL has migrated its  existing ISP license along with BWA spectrum to the Unified  License to provide all services allowedunder the license.
RJIL was allotted Mobile Switching Centre Code (MSC),  Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code  (MNC) for mobile access services across all 22 circles by the  Department of Telecommunications (DoT) providing it with  about 22 million mobile phone numbers across India.
In line with the Government’s policy decision of delinking  spectrum allocation from the licenses and offering access  spectrum based on auction process, the GoI has been  conducting spectrum auctions for the access spectrum  from time to time.
In the recently concluded spectrum  auction, RJIL successfully acquired the right to use spectrum  in the 1800 MHz band in 14 key circles across India at a total  cost of ` 11,054 crore.
This spectrum has been acquired  in all metro and Category A circles and all key Category B  and C circles over a contiguous block of 5 MHz.
With this  acquisition, RJIL will be the holder of the largest quantum  of liberalised spectrum (spectrum in any band can be used  for delivering any services deploying any technology).
With  the longest residual spectrum life, RJIL plans to use this  1800 MHz spectrum, in conjunction with its pan India 2,300  MHz spectrum to address the expected surge in demand for  digital services as well as to enhance in-building coverage.
RJIL plans to provide seamless 4G services using FDD-LTE on  1800 MHz and TDD-LTE on 2300 MHz through an integrated  ecosystem.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Pte.
Limited, Singapore, a subsidiary  of RJIL, was granted a Facility Based Operator (FBO) license  in Singapore which will allow it to buy, operate and sell  undersea and/or terrestrial fibre connectivity, set up its  internet point of presence, offer internet transit and peering  services as well as data and voice roaming services in  Singapore.
RJIL has adopted a partnership based model for telecom  infrastructure for 4G wireless and fibre based high speed  broadband services.

Reliance Jio - Field testing Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 79 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports78 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... RELIANCE HARYANA SEZ LTD Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd (RHSL), is a JV between RIL ’s wholly  owned subsidiary, Reliance Ventures Limited (RVL), and  Government of Haryana through Haryana State Industrial &  Investment corporation Ltd (HSIIDC) for developing SEZs / Model Economic Township project and other infrastructure  facilities in Haryana.
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial  Services Limited (IL&FS) became a strategic partner in the  MET project in January 2011.
In view of the economic scenario the development of  SEZs became unviable and in January 2012, RHSL offered  to return 1383.68 acres of land acquired from HSIIDC for  setting up SEZs.
HSIIDC is in the process of taking back said  land from RHSL and exit the JV.
RHSL has commenced development of the phase I of the  Model Economic Township and units of Panasonic and  Denso are already operational.
Land consolidation is in  the process and it is expected that over the next one year  the Company will be applying for the development of  approximately 1000 acres of land.
RHSL has engaged itself in various CSR activities in the field  of health care by providing mobile health services to 18  villages, free eye and dental camps, women empowerment  and training, technical education and skills development  and creation of village infrastructure in the project area.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT RIL actively stimulates entrepreneurship throughout the  organisation and encourage its people to identify and  seize opportunities.
The current economic environment  in combination with significant growth ambitions of the  Reliance Group carries with it an evolving set of risks.
RIL  recognises that these risks need to be managed to protect its  customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders  to achieve its business objectives and enable sustainable  growth.
Risk and opportunity management is therefore a  key element of the overall RIL strategy.
This section provides  an overview of the key strategic risks, the RIL risk & control  framework, and its approach to risk management.
Creating Value through Risk Management RIL operates in diverse industries and global markets and  therefore requires a balanced approach to risk management.
An integrated system of risk management and internal  controls framework which is tailored to the specific RIL  segments and businesses is deployed taking into account  various factors such as the size and nature of the inherent  risks and the regulatory environment of the individual  business segment or operating company.
This framework  undergoes continuous improvements to allow RIL  management to optimise its management of risk exposures  while taking advantage of business opportunities.
RIL ’s View on Risk Risk Appetite RIL ’s risk appetite is linked to its strategic approach and is  based on the stance it has taken across five areas: zz Strategic:  RIL manages strategic risk in the pursuit of  profitable growth in both mature and emerging markets.
Given the volatile markets and economic climate in  which it operates, the adaptability of its people, its  service offering and its infrastructure are key zz Operations:  To strive to minimize all people and safety  risks and take a balanced approach to other operations  risks, taking into account the risk and reward profile of  key business decisions zz Financial: To maintain a prudent financing strategy,  even when undertaking major investment and therefore  taking controlled risks in this area zz Reporting:  RIL believes that accurate and reliable  information provides a competitive advantage and is  key to effective management of its business.
It therefore  accepts minimal risk in relation to reporting risks zz Compliance:  To comply with laws and regulation is  fundamental to maintaining its license to operate in the  various industries that it operates in Risk Factors RIL ’s focus is on those risks that threaten the achievement of  business objectives of the Group over the short to medium  term.
An overview of these risks is provided hereafter,  including the actions taken to mitigate these risks and any  related opportunities: Strategic Risks Prices and Markets RIL ’s financial performance is subject to the fluctuating prices  of crude oil & gas and downstream petroleum products.
Prices of oil & gas products are affected by supply and  demand, both globally and regionally.
Factors that influence  the supply and demand include operational issues, natural  disasters, political instability, economic conditions etc.
For  example lower prices will mean lower revenues for RIL ’s  upstream production and as a result the long term projects  may become less profitable.
Additionally, this may also have  the impact on reserves booking.
Prolonged unfavourable  conditions could also result in, cancellation of projects  79 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports78 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... or impairment of assets.
Since RIL operates an integrated  hydrocarbon business some of these risks can be offset by  gains in other parts of the Group.
In addition, RIL proactively  hedges these exposures.
Competitive Forces While RIL seeks to compete on the basis of product  differentiation, it operates in commodity-type markets.
It is  therefore important to manage its costs to ensure it has an  edge in pricing over its competitors.
Surplus refining capacity in India, augmentation of refining  capacities by PSUs and the additions of new refining  capacity in Asia, notably in China and the Middle East will  increase competition in the region potentially impacting  GRM in its Refining and Marketing business.
As a risk  mitigating strategy, RIL continues to diversify its product  portfolio and also develop new export markets.
It is also  investing in projects to strengthen cost competitiveness.
Brand and Reputational risks RIL is one of the leading brands in the country, hence its  brand and reputation is an important asset.
The Group has  defined the Code of Conduct and Operating Model that  govern how all employees in RIL and its Group companies  operate.
Compliance with these codes of conduct,  organisational policies and other regulatory compliance  and governance requirements are key to protect   Reliance’s reputation.
Political instability, acts of terrorism, government  policies Social or civil unrest, within India or internationally can  have an impact on the Group’s operations.
Potential  developments that may impact its business operations  include government pricing policy of petroleum products,  piracy on high seas, any changes to Indo-US economic  policy, acts of terrorism or civil unrest that may have an  impact on safe operation of its facilities and transportation  of its products.
Political unrest and tensions in the Middle East, North  Africa can cause short term fluctuations in crude oil prices  and crude availability.
To mitigate the risks resulting from  non-availability of crude and feedstocks, the Company  has a diversified crude sourcing strategy from multiple  geographies (Asia, Middle East, West Africa, Latin / South  America and North Africa) under both short term and long  term arrangements.
Operations Risks Changing Technology and Obsolescence Risk The changing technologies and the natural ageing of  existing facilities pose the risk of production plants  becoming obsolete and uneconomic.
Aged plants are  prone to unplanned shutdowns and increased maintenance  and operating costs.
Deployment of new technologies and  on-going maintenance processes are key to enhancing the  reliability of operations and reduction in operating costs  while improving the safety of operating conditions while  extending the useful life of assets.
Evolving HSSE risks The RIL Group is exposed to a wide spectrum of health,  safety, security and environmental risks (HSSE), given the  diversity and complexity of the industries RIL operates in.
The exploration and production of oil & gas, transport of  the hydrocarbons and their further refining and processing  is regulated by various HSSE related regulations across the  geographies where RIL operates.
A major HSSE incident,  such as fire, oil spill, security breach can result in loss of  life, environmental degradation and overall disruption in  business activities.
RIL follows an HSE Policy that “Safety of  persons overrides all production targets” , which incentivises  all employees to strive for excellence in safety management  for the benefit of its employees, customers and the  communities in which they live.
RIL has set itself the goal  of ‘zero injuries and accidents‘ .
The Group conducts HSSE  audits to get assurance on HSSE managements frameworks  protocols and regulatory compliances.
Financial Risks Treasury Risks Treasury risks include, amongst others, exposure to  movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The Group is exposed to fluctuating dollar and euro prices.
While a majority of the Company’s purchases and sales are  denominated in US dollars, the Company is exposed to  currency risk where the realisation of sales proceeds is in  local currencies.
The Group seeks to maintain a financial framework to ensure  that it is able to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity  and financial capacity.
This framework constrains the level of  capital at risk for the purposes of position taken in financial  instruments.
RIL uses debt instruments like commercial  paper and bonds to raise capital.
The main Treasury risks  include interest rate risks and foreign exchange risk.
Interest Rate Risks RIL borrows funds in the domestic and international markets  to meet long-term and short-term funding requirements.
It  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 81 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports80 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... is subject to risks arising from interest rate fluctuations both  LIBOR and Rupee based interest rates since majority of RIL ’s  borrowing are floating rate debt.
Foreign Exchange Risks RIL has majority of operations in the markets which are  priced in directly or indirectly in US dollars.
As a result the  functional currency for most of the RIL Businesses is dollar  with a reporting currency in INR.
The major currency to  which RIL is exposed is US Dollar.
Consequently RIL is  exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when it  enters into transactions which are not denominated in INR,  when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are  translated at the reporting date and as a result of holding  net investment in operations which are non-INR.
Commodity Related Risks Commodity risk management is an important component  of RIL ’s supply and distribution function.
The Company is  exposed to risks arising from: zz Timing risk resulting from mismatch between pricing in  of crude and feedstocks and pricing out of petroleum  products zz Absence of liquidity in the market and ability to hedge  known exposures zz Basis risk resulting from differences between the pricing  basis for the physical purchases / sales and the pricing  basis of the underlying hedging instruments used to  hedge the financial exposures created from the physical  trades The Company has put in place Treasury and Commodity  risk management policies which provide the framework for  decision making with respect to currency exposures and  commodity trading positions.
Reporting Risks Estimation of provisions and reserves The estimation of proved oil & gas reserves involves  subjective judgements and determinations based on  available geological, technical, contractual and economic  information.
These estimates may change depending on  availability of new information from production and drilling  activities, or changes in economic factors like change in  pricing of crude oil, projection of foreign exchange rates,  natural decline in the field and unexpected geological  complexity etc.
The published provisions and reserves may  also be subject to correction due to errors in application of  published rules and change in guidance.
Any downward  adjustment would indicate lower production volumes in  the upstream business.
Compliance Risks The evolution of the regulatory environment across the  globe has resulted into increased regulatory scrutiny that  raises minimum standards required at Reliance.
This signifies  the alignment of corporate performance objectives, whilst  ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
RIL  recognises that regulatory requirements can be both a  threat and a source of competitive advantage and therefore  it will: zz Strive to understand the changing regulatory standards  so as to strengthen its decision making processes and  integrate these in its business strategy of each of the  industries in which it operates zz Drive business performance through the convergence  of risk, compliance processes and control mechanisms  to ensure continued operational efficiency and  effectiveness zz Exploit significant opportunities arising out of changing  regulatory landscape to realign business processes and  strategies How RIL Manages Risk Reliance’s Board of Directors is responsible for the direction  and oversight of the Group, its governance principles as  well as the establishment of a system of internal control  to mitigate material business risks.
The Reliance Executive  Committee is responsible for the design and operation  of the Reliance System of Internal Control which includes  Risk Management and Internal Control frameworks and for  reviewing its effectiveness.
The System of Internal Control is designed to manage  the risks that may prevent RIL from achieving its business  objectives and to provide reasonable assurance that all  material misstatements, frauds or violations of laws and  regulations will be prevented.
The RIL system of internal  control which includes: a) Governance Structures and Policies zz  Establishing and communicating a common vision,  mission, values and strategies by top management  (strategy setting) zz  Establishing appropriate performance  management systems and processes to drive the  achievement of Group objectives (performance  management) zz  Establishing expected and acceptable behaviours  while pursuing the achievement of business  objectives through a code of conduct (tone from  the top) 81 02-33  Company Overview 165-270  Financial Statements 271-284  Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164  Statutory Reports80 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... zz  Delegation of authorities which establishes  levels of autonomy at the various levels in the  organisation b) Risk Management and Internal Control zz Policies and procedures which codify requirements  with respect to the management of risks and  opportunities zz Risk management processes which manage the  key business risks of the Group and each Business  segment zz Operational controls embedded within the  business processes to enable the achievement of  business objectives zz Information systems which support the decision  making processes at all levels of the organisation c) Independent Internal and External Assurance d) Board and Business Oversight mechanisms Governance Structures and Policies The setting of clear and effective business objectives for  the Group is a key aspect of the system of internal control.
RIL ’s Group strategic framework sets out its Group strategy,  financial framework and how it manages risk.
RIL has clearly  defined its vision, mission and core values.
Its Group strategy  focuses on safety and centres on playing to its competitive  strengths.
Senior leadership plays a critical role in ensuring  conformance with RIL ’s stated business principles and   core values.
Risk Management and Internal Control RIL has introduced several improvements to Integrated  Enterprise Risk Management, Internal Controls Management  and Assurance Frameworks and processes to drive a common  integrated view of risks, optimal risk mitigation responses  and efficient management of internal control and internal  audit activities.
This integration is enabled by all three being  fully aligned across Group wide Risk Management, Internal  Control and Internal Audit methodologies and processes  supported by a common SAP GRC platform.
The RIL Group  has adopted the following key risk mitigation and internal  control design principles and strategies: zz Risk management and Internal Control frameworks  are designed and implemented to manage rather  than completely eliminate the risk of failure to achieve  business objectives zz Maximising the Embedding of Controls in systems  and business process designs (configured automated  checks and balances, configured delegations, as well as  automated monitoring with alerts and shut outs where  necessary) to reduce the resource burden of controls.
zz Dual Ownership for Risk Management – Business  segments have primary accountability for business risks  but Corporate Functions (Finance, HR, IT) operate and  support Business segments in ensuring an effective  control framework.
The Business and Functional CEOs  are the key owners of the control framework for their  respective Business or Function.
zz A “Three-Not-Out” risk mitigation model is applied in  each high exposure area with multiple checks (initiate,  validate, approve) and hardware redundancy for  enhanced process safety.
zz In-line and off-line audits of significant risk areas and  controls deployed through systems, processes and  other operational activities.
These assurance activities  are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute  assurance against material misstatement or loss.
zz Where a significant risk materialises into a significant  business incident, these are to be managed through the  Groups Business Continuity, Emergency Response and  Crisis Management Processes.
These elements increasingly provide the “foundations”  of the Reliance Risk Management and Internal Control  Frameworks.
RIL ’s Risk Management Approach Risk  Areas 1)  System &   Process  embedded 3)  “Three-not-out”  protection   applied 2)  Dual  ownership 4)  In-line and  off-line   audits Independent Internal and External  Assurance Effective Risk Management and Internal Audit functions  are key elements of the RIL governance framework.
Risk  management ownership is fully embedded in the Business  whilst the Risk Management function aligns, supports and  facilitates the risk management processes of the Group.
The  Internal Audit Function provides assurance to the Board  Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued) 83 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports82 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... and Senior Management in the various Businesses and  Functions that the system of internal control deployed is  appropriately designed to manage the key business risks  and is operating effectively.
Governance, Risk Management, Internal Controls and  Internal Audit are aligned at Group level to enable full  alignment and integration of integrated methodologies,  processes and systems.
The Internal Audit and Risk  Management functions report directly to the Chairman and  Managing Director with direct access to the Chairman of the  Audit Committee.
The role of Internal Audit, its mission and  goals, are set out in the Company’s Internal Audit Charter,  which has been approved by the Audit Committee and  Executive Committee.
Board and Busin ess Oversight Mechanisms  (Business Risk a nd Assurance Committees) During 2013, Business Risk and Assurance Committees  (BRACs) were established to provide the necessary formal  structures to implement the Group’s Risk Management  policies and to facilitate the risk management process for  the respective Businesses and Functions.
The BRACs provide  a platform to: zz Integrate multidisciplinary views on the key  organisational risks zz Prioritise the most relevant risks to the Business or  Function zz Align risk management, internal control and assurance  activities across the Three Lines of Defence: Business and  Functions, Controlling and Compliance Functions and  Internal Audit The BRAC for each Business or Function integrates the senior  leadership representation of the business, Risk management  and Internal Audit Functions around a common agenda  covering governance, risk management and internal  audit matters.
The Committee meet on quarterly basis to  review and assess the effectiveness of the respective risk  management and internal control frameworks.
BRACs  provide an integrated view of risk to the Audit Committee  and Executive Committee on a quarterly basis.
INNOVATION, RESEARCH &  DEVELOPMENT Innovation is not only important for organisational  sustainability, but also vital for long-term value creation.
Innovation can happen as one all-encompassing stroke  or in small incremental steps, both of which can take the  business to the next level.
RIL believes in pushing boundaries to achieve business  innovation.
Innovation can mean elevation in the level  of technology being used, greater diversity or resilience  in the business model being pursued or application of  higher intelligence and deeper insight in the processes  being followed in resource utilisation.
RIL has shaped an  organisational culture that fosters innovation at every  single step.
The drive for innovation is led by the Reliance Innovation  Council  comprising Nobel laureates, global strategists  and iconic thought leaders.
The Council meets annually  to give direction to RIL ’s innovation agenda.
The Reliance  Innovation Leadership Centre  (RIL-C) manages the  innovation ecosystem with the aim of making innovation,  a way of life at RIL.
The ecosystem approach defines  innovation in the realm of people, processes, systems,  technology, new businesses and structures.
RIL-C identifies  innovation opportunities across the organisation and  designs, develops and deploys innovation programmes.
For example, the ‘Beyonders’ programme aims at grooming  innovation leaders by giving potential leaders an  opportunity to innovate, as well as training on systematic  methods of innovation.
The Leading Expert Access Programme (LEAP) ‘democratises  inspiration’ by providing a platform for interaction with  luminaries and accomplished leaders from diverse areas.
Powered by creative energies of thousands of its people, RIL  will surely succeed in creating new exponential value, with  the ultimate aim of reinventing the way people live their lives.
Research & Technology and Innovation are two key focus  areas to enhance RIL ’s value creation, identifying new  platforms for its sustainable growth.
’ Reliance Technology  Group ’ (RTG), RIL ’s centre for research and technology  activities, focuses on (i) new products, processes and catalyst  development to support existing business, and create  breakthrough technologies for new businesses, and (ii)  advanced troubleshooting, support to capital projects, and  profit and reliability improvements in manufacturing plants.
To accelerate research efforts at RIL, a new Research Centre  has been recently commissioned at the Reliance Corporate  Park (RCP) in Navi Mumbai.
The facility will be the central  hub of research and new technologies.
It is a world-class  facility providing state-of-the-art equipment for hundreds  of RIL ’s scientists and engineers.

RIL aims to make  its products more safe and environment friendly.
1.
List three products or services whose design has  incorporated social or environmental concerns,  risks and/or opportunities   It is RIL ’s constant endeavour to make products that  have a positive impact on the environment and cater to  consumer needs.
Some such products created during  FY 2013-14 are listed below:  a)  PP non-woven fabric     This is utilised as a crop cover for protection  against extreme cold weather.
It prevents the crop  leaves from freezing and allows sunlight to pass,  thus resulting in normal photosynthesis.
The cover  also acts as a protection from pests and insects.
It eradicates the use of chemical pesticides,  maintaining the natural quality of soil.
During FY 2013-14 RIL has undertaken this  initiative for watermelon, chilly, chappan tinda   and coriander crops.
Effect of frost Field covered with PPNW Crop Cover Crop protected from frost  b)  Double Wall Corrugated Polyethylene Pipes     This is utilised in sewage systems for conveyance of  municipal sewage and wastewater.
The traditional  pipes, generally used in the sewage system, are  made of concrete and possess major risks.
These  risks include breaks and leaks due to its brittle  nature, corrosion and increased number of joints.
It results in groundwater contamination, and in  some cases contamination of potable water.
DWC  PE pipes have a number of technical advantages  Business Responsibility Report (Continued) 93 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 34 -164   Statutory Reports92 Reliance Industries Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Growth is Life... over traditional piping systems.
These pipes are  stronger and hence reduce occurrence of leakages.
c)  PVC-based food grain packaging    PVC food grain storage structures are airtight  (hermetic) and unsupported rectangular structures  made of lightweight UV-resistant PVC sheets.
Due  to excellent gas tightness of the structure, it can  maintain low oxygen and high carbon dioxide level  within the packaging.
This ensures zero survival of  insects, which in turn, protects food grains.

Procedures in place for sustainable sourcing  (including transportation) and percentage of   inputs sourced sustainably   The Company’s motto is to establish long term  relationship with its vendors and include them in its  growth story.
In addition to techno-commercial aspects,  RIL ’s procedures with regard to finalising vendors  emphasises on environmental practices, existing  certifications, safe working conditions, prevention of  child labour and general housekeeping.
RIL engages  with its vendors periodically and also offers technical  assistance whenever required.
The selection procedure  of RIL ’s transport vendors (Trucks and Containers)  involves scrutiny at various levels like young vehicle/ container fleet, presence of mandatory inspections and  safe driving procedures.
Further, the Company urges its  large group of transport vendors to focus on load and  route optimisation to ensure fuel efficiency and reduce  the environmental impact due to transportation.
PTA product bulk dispatch at Hazira   At RIL ’s Hazira operations, bulk dispatching of PTA  product has been implemented.
Dispatch levels have  increased to 70-75% of PTA.
The higher dispatch  volume in the tanks (32MT/truck when compared to  jumbo bags - 16.5MT/truck) has resulted in emission  reduction due to decreased number of trips.
Green Polymer Packaging Bags   Green polymer (fully recyclable) packaging is used in  the packaging of polyester and polymer products.
A  weight reduction of 3.5%-12% was achieved without  compromising on mechanical properties of packaging  materials.
The process has lowered the number of trucks  required for transportation of the product thereby  reducing fuel consumption and hence emissions.
3.
Steps taken to procure goods and services from  local and small producers, including communities  and capability building activities undertaken for  local and small vendors   In order to ensure a positive impact of sourcing of  raw materials and other resources as well as product  distribution, RIL supports, encourages and develops  local vendors.
E.g., the Company developed a local  vendor for the supply of a critical chemical.
Various  contracts have been entered with local villagers  around RIL ’s plants in vehicle hiring, material handling,  housekeeping, waste handling and horticulture.
These  contracts have led to entrepreneurship development  around the manufacturing sites and have created  employment for the populace.
Through financial assistance and encouragement, RIL  supports many small suppliers, predominantly civil  contractors and transport suppliers.
Some of these  partners have been serving to RIL for the past two  generations.
4.
Mechanism to recycle products and waste and the  percentage of recycling of products and waste  (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%)    RIL has taken various initiatives towards waste  management and continuously monitors it with a view  to ensure reduction in waste generation.
RIL has taken  various measures such as converting waste to organic  manure and bio gas generation.
RIL ensures responsible disposal of waste generated by  partnering  with various agencies to encourage end-of- life recycling and reuse.
At Hoshiarpur and Barabanki  recycled polyester fibre is being produced through  post-consumer PET bottle recycling.
Total recycled material at  Manufacturing Divisions  (tonnes) 9.4 % Increase in recycled material utilisation 12-13 63,219 13-14 69,147   The industrial waste generated at Naroda plant is  converted into useful ‘bio-manure’ by the vermi- composting method, thereby reducing the load of waste  disposa l on the environment.
The Jamnagar refinery has reduced its load on the  environment by tapping and desalinating sea water  instead of using fresh water resources.
The waste  water generated is treated and used for green belt  development thereby ensuring zero effluent discharge.

RIL has recycled treated waste wate r across its  manufacturing divisions which amount to more than  50% of its fresh water withdrawal.
Recycling of used PET blend fabrics by bio route   Polyester is not easily amenable to microbial attack and  hence polyester fabric waste poses a huge disposal  problem.
Separation of polyester from its blends  and dye will aid in recycling of the polyester.
There  are some chemical recycling processes including  hydrolysis, methanolysis and glycolysis that are being  adopted to digest the polyester portion of the blends.
Work is underway by RIL ’s R&D group on exploring the  possibility of recycling used PET via a biological route  in an environmentally friendly manner using enzymes  from microbes.
Principle 3  Employee Well-being Businesses should promote the well-being of all  employees RIL believes in its people power propelling its progressive  growth.
Their knowledge, experience and passion to  perform are fundamental to building the organisation  further.
Hence RIL provides its employees with  opportunities that encourage them to excel.

Independent Auditors’ Report TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF RELIANCE INDUSTRIES  LIMITED REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS 1.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated  financial statements of RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LIMITED  (the Company), its subsidiaries and jointly controlled  entities (collectively referred to as “the Group”), which  comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31,  2014, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and  the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then  ended and a summary of significant accounting policies  and other explanatory information.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.
Management is responsible for the preparation of these  consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair  view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated  financial performance and consolidated cash flows of  the Group in accordance with the Accounting Standards  notified under the Companies Act, 1956 (the Act) (which  continue to be applicable in respect of Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 in terms of General Circular  15/2013 dated 13 th September, 2013 of the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs).
This responsibility includes the design,  implementation and maintenance of internal control  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair  view and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY 3.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with  ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  consolidated financial statements are free from material  misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in  the consolidated financial statements.
The procedures  selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the  auditor considers internal control relevant to the Group’s  preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial  statements that give a true and fair view in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
An audit  also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the  accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the  accounting estimates made by the Management, as well  as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated  financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence  we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our audit opinion.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based on  the consideration of the reports of the other auditors  on the financial statements / consolidated financial  statements of the subsidiaries and associates as noted  below, the consolidated financial statements give a true  and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India: (a) in the case of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, of the  state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2014; (b) in the case of the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss, of the profit of the Group for the year ended  on that date and (c) in the case of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement,  of the cash flows of the Group for the year ended on  that date.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  The consolidated financial statements relate to Reliance Industries Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiary companies,  associates and joint ventures.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis: a) The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line basis by  adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after fully eliminating  intra-group balances and intra-group transactions in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS) 21 - “Consolidated  Financial Statements” b) Interest in Joint Ventures have been accounted by using the proportionate consolidation method as per  Accounting Standard (AS) 27 - “Financial Reporting of Interest in Joint Ventures” .
c) In case of foreign subsidiaries, being non-integral foreign operations, revenue items are consolidated at the  average rate prevailing during the year.
All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end of the  year.
Any exchange difference arising on consolidation is recognised in the exchange fluctuation reserve.
d) The difference between the cost of investment in the subsidiaries, over the net assets at the time of acquisition of  shares in the subsidiaries is recognised in the financial statements as Goodwill or Capital Reserve, as the case may  be.
e) The difference between the proceeds from disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying amount of its  assets less liabilities as of the date of disposal is recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being  the profit or loss on disposal of investment in subsidiary.
f ) Minority Interest’s share of net profit of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted against the  income of the group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to shareholders of the Company.
g) Minority Interest’s share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the consolidated  balance sheet separate from liabilities and the equity of the Company’s shareholders.
h) Investment in Associate Companies has been accounted under the equity method as per Accounting Standard  (AS) 23 - “Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements” .
i) The Company accounts for its share in change in net assets of the associates, post acquisition, after eliminating  unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and its associates to the extent of  its share, through its Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent such change is attributable to the associates’ Profit  or Loss through its reserves for the balance, based on available information.
j) The difference between the cost of investment in the associates and the share of net assets at the time of  acquisition of shares in the associates is identified in the financial statements as Goodwill or Capital Reserve as the  case may be.
k) As far as possible, the consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like  transactions and other events in similar circumstances and are presented in the same manner as the Company’s  separate financial statements.
B.
Investments other than in subsidiaries and associates have been accounted as per Accounting Standard (AS) 13 on “Ac- counting for Investments” .
C. Other significant accounting policies  These are set out under “Significant Accounting Policies” as given in the Company’s separate financial statements.

The  NECS system takes advantage of the centralised accounting  system in banks.

The branches participating in  NECS can, however, be located anywhere across the length  and breadth of the country.
2.3 What are the benefits of NECS (payment  through electronic facilities)?
Some of the major benefits are : zz Investor need not make frequent visits to his bank for  depositing the physical paper instruments.
zz Prompt credit is given to the bank account of the investor  through electronic clearing.
zz Fraudulent encashment of warrants is avoided.
zz Exposure to delays / loss in postal service are avoided.

275 02-33   Company Overview 165-270   Financial Statements 34 -164  Statutory Reports 271-284   Shareholders’ Referencer 2.4 How to avail of NECS Facility?
Investors holding shares in physical form may send their  NECS Mandate Form, duly filled in, to the Company’s R&TA.
The Form may be downloaded from the Company’s website  www.ril.com under the section “Investor Relations” .
However, if shares are held in dematerialised form, NECS  mandate has to be sent to the concerned DP directly, in the  format prescribed by the DP .
Investors must note that NECS essentially operates on the  new and unique bank account number, allotted by banks  post implementation of Core Banking Solutions (CBS) for  centralized processing of inward instructions and efficiency  in handling bulk transactions.
In this regard, shareholders are requested to furnish the  new bank account number allotted by the banks post  implementation of CBS, along with a copy of cheque  pertaining to the concerned account: zz to the R&TA of the Company in case the shareholders  hold shares in physical form; and zz to the concerned DP in case the shareholders hold shares  in demat form.

2.6 What is payment of dividend through NEFT  Facility and how does it operate?
NEFT is a nation-wide payment system facilitating  electronic transfer of funds from one account to another.

This extends to all over the country, and  is not necessarily restricted to the 91 designated centres  where payment can be handled through ECS.
To facilitate  payment through NEFT, the shareholder is required to  ensure that the bank branch where his/her account is  operated, is under CBS and also records the particulars of  the new bank account with the DP with whom the demat  account is maintained.
2.7 What is payment of dividend through Direct  Credit and how does it operate?

Shareholders may write to the Company’s R&TA, furnishing  the particulars of the dividend not received, and quoting  the folio number /DPID and Client ID particulars (in case of  dematerialised shares).
On expiry of the validity period, if  the dividend warrant is still shown as unpaid in the records  of the Company, duplicate warrant will be issued.
The R&TA  would request the concerned shareholder to execute an  indemnity before issuing the duplicate warrant.
No duplicate warrants will be issued against those shares  wherein a ‘stop transfer indicator’ has been instituted either  by virtue of a complaint or by law, unless the procedure for  releasing the same has been completed.
2.9 Why do the shareholders have to wait till  the expiry of the validity period of the original  warrant for issue of duplicate warrant?
Since the dividend warrants are payable at par at several  centres across the country, banks do not accept ‘stop  payment’ instructions.
Hence, shareholders have to wait  till the expiry of the validity of the original warrant for issue  of duplicate warrant.
Validity of Dividend warrant is three  months from the date of issue of the warrant.
2.10  Why shares should be transferred before  the Book Closure/ Record Date fixed for dividend  payment?

It is recommended that the shareholders  should lodge a FIR with police station regarding loss of  share certificate(s).
They should send their request for duplicate share  certificate(s) to the Company’s R&TA and submit documents  as required by the R&TA.
5.11  What is the procedure to get the share  certificates issued in various denominations  consolidated into a single certificate?
Consolidation of share certificates helps in saving costs  in the event of dematerialising shares and also provides  convenience in holding the shares physically.
Shareholders  having certificates in various denominations under the same  folio should send all the certificates to the Company’s R&TA  for consolidation of all the shares into a single certificate.
If the shares are not under the same folio but have the  same order of names, the shareholder should write to the  Company’s R&TA for the prescribed form for consolidation  of folios.
This will help the investors to efficiently monitor  the holding and the corporate benefits receivable thereon.
INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE COMPANY Consolidation of Folios The Company has initiated a unique investor servicing  measure for consolidation of small holdings within the same  household.
In terms of this, those shareholders holding less  than 10 shares (under a single folio) in the Company, within the  same household, can send such shares for transfer along with  transfer forms duly filled in and signed, free of cost; the stamp  duty involved in such cases will be borne by the Company.
Scheme for disposal of ‘Odd Lot’ Equity Shares At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on  June 26, 1998, Company’s Founder Chairman Shri Dhirubhai  H. Ambani, announced, for the benefit of small shareholders,  a scheme for disposal of ‘Odd Lot’ shares (the Scheme) to  facilitate such shareholders to realise the full market value  without having to suffer a discount for odd lots.
In order to assist small shareholders in disposal of such odd  lot shares held in physical form, the Company has formed  a Trust known as ‘Reliance Odd Lot Shares Trust’ which will  dispose off the odd lot shares on behalf of the shareholders.
The salient features of the Scheme in force from July 1, 1998,  are as under : zz This Scheme is available to Indian national residents in  respect of any master folio having holdings up to 49  shares; zz The holders of Equity Shares in odd lot (less than 50  shares) may avail of the Scheme by lodging duly filled  in application form and a duly executed transfer deed  along with the relevant share certificate(s); zz The odd lot shares offered under the Scheme are sold  through designated brokers in the BSE / NSE; zz All costs of implementing the Scheme will be borne by  the Company.
COMPANY’S RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE  SHAREHOLDERS / INVESTORS Consolidate Multiple Folios Investors should consolidate their shareholding held in  multiple folios.
This would facilitate one-stop tracking of  all corporate benefits on the shares and would reduce time  and efforts required to monitor multiple folios.
Opt for Corporate Benefits in Electronic Form In case of non cash corporate benefits like split of shares /  bonus shares, the holders of shares in physical form must  opt to get the shares in electronic form by providing the  details of demat account to the R&TA.
Exercise caution There is likelihood of fraudulent transfers in case of folios  with no movement or where the shareholder has either  expired or is not residing at the address registered with the  Company.
Company should be updated on any change of  address or contact details.
Similarly, information of death of  shareholder should also be communicated.
Mode of Postage Share certificates and high value dividend / interest  warrants / cheques / demand drafts should not be sent by  ordinary post.
It is recommended that investors should send  such instruments by registered post or courier.
