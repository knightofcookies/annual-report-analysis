INTEGRA TED ANNUAL REPORT 2017-18 Making Life Better .
For Everyone.
In 2017-18, Reliance completed 40 years of its IPO.
It was a celebration of visionary entrepreneurship,  global scale and all-encompassing value creation.
More importantly, it was an opportunity for us  to rededicate efforts to help build the India of  tomorrow and imagine a future that would see a  billion lives transformed.
At Reliance, the world may have changed around us,  from when we first began, but our commitment and  vision have not.
We have evolved from being a textiles  and polyester company to an integrated player across  energy, materials, retail, entertainment and digital  services.
Y et, it feels like we have only just begun.
We are now focussed on building platforms that will  herald the Fourth Industrial Revolution and will create  opportunities and avenues for India and all its citizens  to realise their true potential.
Historically, Reliance has  focussed on setting new industry benchmarks.
When  we created the world's largest single location refinery  at Jamnagar , we put India on the global energy map and  created a national asset.
When we forayed into the retail business, we  accelerated the formalisation of an entire sector by  maximising supply chain efficiency.
And, most recently,  when we entered the digital services business through  Jio, we have transformed the Indian telecom space,  and created globally unheard of benchmarks in terms  of subscriber acquisition, data consumption and  infrastructure ramp-up.
T rue to our vision, we are working on ideas and initiatives  that will simplify lives.
Collectively, Reliance's products  and services portfolio touches almost all Indians on a  daily basis, across economic and social spectrums.
We  are leveraging technology and innovation to enrich our  offerings and ensuring that we provide ease of living   and working through what we do.
Our endeavours are also designed to enrich human  experience across every touch point.
We are working  on the technologies of the future to provide seamless  access and a better quality of life.
For all.
Finally, we are clear that all our efforts must converge  into real value creation for all our stakeholders.
We have demonstrated our ability to do so through   the financial returns we have delivered, the contribution  we have made to the country's exchequer and of course,  through the impact our social initiatives create.
For us, this philosophy is an article of faith and we shall  continue to progress on this path.

For Everyone.
Corporate Overview 1-40  Management Review Governance Financial Statements Notice I am happy to tell you that we have again delivered  outstanding	performances	on	both	financial	and	operational	 parameters across all our business segments.
FY 2017-18  turned out to be a watershed year in the history of Reliance.
Our	new-age	consumer	businesses	achieved	leadership	 positions nationally – their growth rates outpacing the best  in the world.
Jio, now the world’s largest and fastest growing  mobile data network, stunned the world and made us proud  by	turning	profitable	in	the	very	first	year	of	operations.
Reliance Retail is the only Indian retailer to rank among  the	world’s	Top	200	global	retail	chains.
Our	energy	and	 materials businesses successfully completed one of the  world’s largest, most complex, and most innovative projects,  achieving a level of integration that is unprecedented  globally.
Yes, we have made a spectacular start to our Golden Decade.
In a world full of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and  ambiguity, these achievements are indeed commendable.
I thank and congratulate everyone at Reliance for this feat.
The global economy is now growing at its fastest pace since  2010, with the upturn becoming increasingly synchronised  across countries.
The world economy is expected to  strengthen further in 2018 and 2019, with economic  growth projected to rise to about 4%, from 3.7% in 2017.
Stronger investment, the rebound in global trade and higher  employment are helping make the recovery increasingly  broad-based.
This long-awaited lift, supported by policy  stimulus, is being accompanied by solid employment  gains, a moderate upturn in investment and a pick-up in  trade growth.
The continued rise in global trade was led by  pickup in import demand in developed markets.
Growing  protectionism impacting trading relations and geo-political  tensions in parts of Asia are a key area of concern.
India’s economy maintained its strong growth in FY 2017- 18 – the Gross Domestic Product growth was 6.7%, with  a strong 7.7% increase in the last quarter of the year.
With  the	‘One	Nation,	One	Tax’	GST	regime	being	implemented,	 and gradually stabilising by the second half of the year, the  economy witnessed upsurge in investments, consumption,  as well as government spending.
Industrial activity  rebounded, and services indicators too showed positive  trends.
Thanks to a series of policy initiatives, India moved  into the world’s Top 100 countries in terms of ease of doing  business.
The country also retained its position as a favoured  destination for foreign capital, with gross foreign direct  investment	inflows	of	$64.6	bn	in	2017.
Reliance improved on its last year’s record performance  to	post	a	20.6%	jump	in	net	profit	to	₹36,075	crore	($5.5	 billion).
It	also	became	the	first	Indian	company	to	record	an	 EBITDA	of	over	$10	billion,	with	our	key	businesses	–	Refining	 & Marketing, Petrochemicals, Retail and Digital Services –  achieving record earnings performance.
The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold,  wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to  consolidated	profits.
From	a	mere	2%	in	FY	2016-17,	Jio	and	 Retail	accounted	for	13.1%	of	RIL’s	consolidated	Segment	 EBITDA in FY 2017-18.
This was achieved notwithstanding a  sharp	33.6%	spurt	in	consolidated	EBITDA	to	₹74,184	crore.
Our	aim	is	to	have	the	consumer	businesses	contribute	on	 par with the energy and materials business over the next  decade, when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee.
The	refining	and	petrochemical	businesses	posted	record	 level	of	profitability	owing	to	expanded	capacities,	high	 operating rates, and improved cost competitiveness.
The  refining	business	improved	upon	the	preceding	year’s	 strong	Gross	Refining	Margins	(GRMs).
The	petrochemicals	 segment	posted	a	significant	jump	in	profits	due	to	higher	 volumes from expanded capacities and better margins.
Refining & Marketing Globally, oil demand grew at the rate of 1.6 mb/d in CY 2017,  with Asia alone accounting for close to two-thirds of the total  growth.
Oil	demand	in	India	grew	5.3%	in	FY	2017-18,	similar	 to the 5.4% growth of FY 2016-17.
The transportation sector  drove the overall demand in India, with gasoline demand  rising	10%,	aviation	fuel	growing	9%,	and	diesel	6.6%.
LPG	 demand	grew	8%	in	FY	2017-18,	reflecting	an	increase	in	 household penetration.
With economic activity picking up across the world, the  global oil demand outlook for 2018 continues to remain  Dear Fellow Shareowners, Our	motto	“Growth	is	Life”	aptly	captures	the	ever-evolving	spirit	of	 Reliance.
All our businesses endeavors to deliver superior value to our  stakeholders and make life better for everyone.
Mukesh D. Ambani Chairman and Managing Director Letter to Shareholders  7  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18Letter to Shareholders strong.
IEA has forecast that in 2018, the world will consume  an additional 1.4 mb/d of crude oil.
The growing global  demand	and	reducing	inventories	augur	well	for	the	refining	 industry over the next 12-18 months.
The	refining	and	marketing	segment	reported	a	3.2%	 increase	in	EBIT,	climbing	to	its	highest	ever	level	of	₹25,869	 crore	($4.0	billion).
The	GRMs	for	the	year	rose	to	a	nine-year	 high	of	$11.6/bbl,	climbing	from	last	year’s	$11.0/bbl.
RIL’s	GRM	outperformed	the	Singapore	complex	margins	 by	$4.4/bbl.
In	FY	2017-18,	the	Singapore	complex	margin	 averaged	$7.2/bbl,	compared	to	$5.8/bbl	in	FY	2016-17,	 owing	to	strong	product	cracks	aided	by	firm	oil	demand	 growth	and	lagging	refining	capacity	additions.
We have maintained the highest safety standards and  relentlessly	strived	to	improve	energy	efficiency	and	 minimise operating and maintenance costs.
We have ensured  adoption of latest developments in technology to improve  asset reliability and avoid unplanned outages, thereby  enabling high on-stream factor.
Reliance has constructed the world’s largest petcoke  gasification	unit	at	Jamnagar	–	one	of	the	most	complex	 projects that has integrated as many as 83 process units with  refineries	and	other	downstream	units.
These	process	units	 operate in extreme conditions, with temperatures ranging  from	(-)190°C	to	(+)1480°C,	and	pressure	fluctuating	from	 vacuum to 120 standard atmosphere.
This project will bring  the	full	benefit	of	bottom-of-the-barrel	conversion	to	our	 refining	business	and	further	boost	profitability.
The	gasification	unit	linked	to	the	refinery	in	DTA	is	 currently undergoing trial operations to ensure steady  and reliable syngas supply to the Jamnagar complex.
The  SEZ	gasification	is	under	commissioning.
RIL	continued	to	 re-commission its network of retail fuel stations.
It now has  1,313 operational outlets.
Improving quality of the customer  base, a swift transition to dynamic pricing, and continuing  focus on quality have allowed Petro Retail to bolster its  performance.
Making life better for everyone.
Petrochemicals FY 2017-18 saw stabilisation of the ethane import project and  commissioning	of	the	large	projects	at	Jamnagar	–	refinery	 off-gas	cracker,	PX	expansion,	and	other	downstream	 capacities.
These	projects	took	refinery-petrochemicals	 integration to an unprecedented level globally.
The  commissioning of the Jamnagar projects, one of the world’s  most	complex	set	of	projects,	in	significantly	lesser	time	 and lower cost than comparable projects worldwide, further  endorsed	RIL’s	world-class	project	execution	capability.
The	petrochemicals	segment	benefited	from	expanded	 capacities as various projects commenced operations  through the year.
The segment’s EBIT increased sharply  by	63%	to	its	highest	ever	₹21,179	crore	($3.2	billion).
Production increased 23.7% to 30.8 MMT.
The EBIT margins  increased sharply to a record level of 16.9% from 14.0%  of last year, owing to favourable product deltas across the  integrated polyester chain, PP and PVC.
The	refinery	off-gas	cracker	and	its	downstream	PE	and	 MEG units were successfully stabilised in the last quarter  of FY 2017-18.
With the improved availability of products,  enhanced	reliability	in	operations,	and	feedstock	flexibility,	 RIL	further	strengthened	its	capability	to	serve	the	Indian	 market – one of the fastest growing polymer markets in the  world.
In the polyester value chain, demand outpaced capacity  additions in FY 2017-18 and enabled integrated players like  Reliance post healthy operating rates and improved margins  despite the rising costs.
China’s ban on imports of recycled  polyester supported the demand growth of virgin polyester.
Our	Petrochemicals	business	has	progressed	further	on	 the expression of ‘Chemistry for Smiles’.
We have created  R|Elan™, a portfolio of specialty fabrics, a perfect blend of  “art”	and	“smart”	and	launched	eco-friendly	products	based	 on recycled PET bottles.
Making life better for everyone.
Oil & Gas Our	Oil	&	Gas	business	continued	to	face	headwinds	owing	 to declining volumes and soft prices that improved towards  end	of	the	year.
Volumes	from	conventional	fields	and	US	 Shale were lower on account of natural decline and slowdown  in	development	activity.
Our	domestic	production	was	down	 16.9% at 78.9 Bcfe, whereas the US Shale volume fell 19.7%  to 139.7 Bcfe.
On	the	positive	side,	Reliance	is	poised	to	become	one	of	 the largest non-conventional gas producers in India with the  ramp up of CBM production that crossed 1 MMSCMD.
To  sustain production, the second phase of development has  also commenced.
Reliance	and	its	partner	announced	plans	to	invest	₹40,000	 crore	(~$6	billion)	to	develop	the	already	discovered	deep- water	gas	fields	in	the	KG-D6	Block.
Development	work	for	 R-Cluster	fields	has	commenced.
Satellite	fields	and	Other	 Satellite	fields	will	be	developed	in	an	integrated	manner	as	a	 cluster	project.
With	these	fields,	we	will	venture	into	ultra- deepwater and High Pressure, High Temperature areas – a  first	in	India.
In	our	US	Shale	Gas	business,	the	natural	gas	prices	were	firm	 during	the	year,	with	offtake	from	LNG	and	Mexican	exports.
However, the business conditions remained challenging and  we	continued	with	the	strategy	of	‘fit	for	purpose’	capital	 expenditure.

Strong Cash Flows and Balance Sheet Reliance became India’s first company to cross $10 billion  in EBITDA in FY 2017-18.
As the Company executed India’s  largest-ever capital expenditure programme over the past  five years, the cash profit for the year was up over 31% to  ₹56,034 crore, setting stage for the next growth phase of  company’s earnings cycle.
The Company’s debt-equity ratio remained at a conservative  level.
We have retained our domestic credit ratings of ‘CRISIL  AAA’ from CRISIL and ‘IND AAA’ from India Rating.
For our  international debt, we have an investment grade ‘Baa2’  rating from Moody’s, and ‘BBB+’ from S&P .
We maintained  the ratings even as Reliance went through a large investment  cycle over the past five years.
Reliance is globally acknowledged for its unique and  innovative approach in fund-raising.
It maintains strong  relationships with a large number of international banks,  financial institutions and export credit agencies.
This, along  with our efficient cash flow management and fiscal discipline,  have helped us raise funds at competitive rates and optimise  borrowing costs.
Governance & Safety RIL differentiates itself as an employer of choice.
An  integrated wellness programme for employees has been  implemented in the Company through medical services and  related initiatives.
We are committed to providing a healthy  and safe work environment to employees, contractors, and  all visitors.
9  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18Letter to Shareholders We started the Change Agents for Safety Health and  Environment (CASHe) programme more than a decade  ago.
Ever since, the CASHe programme has evolved into a  movement encompassing the entire enterprise comprising  thousands of improvement projects.
Our	ambition	is:	“Reliance	shall	strive	to	be	a	leader	in	the	 field	of	management	of	Health,	Safety	and	Environment”.
The Jamnagar expansion project has achieved better  than international benchmarks in quality, safety, cost  and	schedule.
Further,	new	records	for	flawless	start-ups	 and	commissioning	have	been	established.
RIL	is	globally	 certified	as	a	‘Healthy	Workplace’	for	the	period	2017-2019	 by the Global Centre for Healthy Workplaces, Tucson, USA.
Making life better for everyone.
Sustainable Growth and Societal Responsibility The Reliance DNA ensures businesses solve problems and  also create societal value for all Indians.
In the 40 years of our  journey since listing, we have strived to conduct businesses  in a manner that is sustainable and inclusive.
When we  started with textiles, we provided the best-in-quality fabrics  to	every	Indian.
Our	petrochemical	products	have	a	role	to	 play in almost every aspect of modern life.
When we entered  the	refining	business,	we	provided	high	spec	fuels	for	Indian	 and global markets.
When we entered telecom, we strived  to provide mobile phones in the hand of every Indian at an  affordable	rate.
Through	Reliance	Retail,	we	have	made	the	 best-in-class global brands available to every section of our  society.
And now, with Jio, with the backdrop of inclusivity,  we have made available high-speed data to every Indian at  the	most	affordable	rates,	with	zero	call	charge	forever.
Making life better for everyone.
Our	operational	framework	has	been	to	integrate	the	six	 capitals – Natural, Human, Manufactured, Intellectual,  Financial, and Social & Relationship – throughout the  organisation and create value for our stakeholders.
An integral part of Reliance’s philosophy is its commitment  to empower and enhance the quality of lives of millions of  people.
Sustainability at Reliance embraces environmental  and social responsibility while creating value for its  stakeholders.
On	the	operations	side,	we	are	working	to	 maximise use of clean energy and minimise the carbon  footprint in collaboration with the best available technology  licensors.
Reliance Foundation is deeply involved in the  areas of rural transformation, health, education, sports for  development, disaster response, urban renewal, and arts,  culture and heritage.
The initiatives of Reliance Foundation  have positively impacted 20 million lives across the nation  and we work incessantly to include all stakeholders in our  growth story.
Making life better for everyone.
Investment in Emerging Technologies Reliance believes that new technologies and data power will  help unleash the potential of India’s human capital.
Making life better for everyone.
RIL	is	piloting	the	use	of	Virtual	Reality	(VR)	to	increase	 safety and reliability through a virtual walkthrough plant  environment for interactive training, testing and process  simulation for all crucial personnel.
RIL	is	implementing	a	world-class	analytics	platform	and	a	 data lake using the best-in-breed technologies for its Big  Data initiatives.
Multiple advanced-stage pilots are being  undertaken to establish extensive use of machine learning  and	artificial	intelligence	with	a	view	of	long-term	adoption	 and institutionalisation.
Conclusion Over	the	last	four	decades,	Reliance	has	continued	to	grow	 and evolve, creating value by building competitive global- scale businesses and delivering increasing shareholder value.
Over	the	past	3-4	years,	we	made	significant	investments	in	 new plants, thus creating organic growth platforms for our  energy	and	materials	businesses.
Our	new-age	businesses	 have shown strong resilience and sustainable growth  potential for 1.3 billion Indians, as well as for Reliance, and will  surely script a glorious chapter in our Golden Decade.
I would like to thank all my colleagues for their dedication,  innovation and hard work.
By creating new benchmarks in  the businesses we operate in, our team is delivering on our  mission to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders  and	India.
These	efforts	also	help	us	to	deliver	inclusive	 growth and make life better for everyone.
I would like to place on record my sincere appreciation to the  Board of Directors for their guidance.
I would like to express  my gratitude to all our stakeholders for their continuing faith  in Reliance.

JioGenNext has been a  great help in terms of refining our operating  model and giving us mentorship.
In that  sense, our experience was exceptional.
JioGenNext has been a great learning  experience.
We have got direct  opportunity to pitch our solution to RIL  leadership and this helped us sharpen our  pitch to other large enterprise customers.
JioGenNext also helped us develop Proofs  of Concept (PoCs) with RIL immediately.
The mentoring that we got from the  JioGenNext team was invaluable and all  the coaching that we got until now has  helped us to get new insights for our  product improvement.
JioGenNext helped us in two very  important ways.
First, they brought in  the best mentors to conduct sessions,  who equipped us with invaluable practical  knowledge on how to create and grow a  company.
Second, JioGenNext introduced  us to various leaders in Jio, who met us  individually and helped us find a use- case in Jio for our product, and it was a  tremendous success.
We created a quick  PoC, which successfully got converted into  a commercial contract.
This wouldn’t have  been possible without JioGenNext.

Overview Global Global economic recovery gathered pace, with the world  economy growing at 3.7% in CY 2017, aided by across-the- board recovery in developed economies, i.e.
United States,  European Union and Japan.
Growth in Non-OECD markets,  however, remained modest.
Green shoots of trade recovery  that was seen towards the end of CY 2016, continued in CY  2017, aided by the recovery in global demand and a sustained  increase in major commodity prices.
The sustained rise  in global trade was led by a pickup in import demand in  developed markets.
While this augurs well for underlying  demand trends, there are risks emerging from rising  protectionism and trade tensions between major economies,  and from geo-political developments in North East Asia and  the Middle East.
Growth accelerated in the US as the economy approached  full employment, labor markets tightened and inflation  started creeping higher.
The US Federal Reserve continued  with the interest rate normalisation cycle in FY 2017-18 by  increasing rates thrice, in Jun 2017, Dec 2017 and Mar 2018.
The world is slowly coming out of the low interest rate and  abundant liquidity regime as advanced economies normalise  monetary policy.
Global oil demand growth remained robust at 1.6 million  barrels per day (mb/d) in CY 2017 led by demand recovery  in the OECD countries and healthy growth in demand from  China and India.
Gasoline demand trends remained robust,  contributing around 68% of oil demand growth in the OECD  countries.
Global oil price strengthened 18% in FY 2017-18,  supported by the OPEC non-OPEC co-operation to extend  the oil production scale-back to 32.5 mb/d till the end of  2018.
Petrochemicals sector globally continued to see high cracker  utilisation levels driven by firm product demand across  key markets.
Global demand for key polymer products  (PE, PP and PVC) grew by 4.1% during 2017, led by India and  China.
Polymer margins remained healthy during the year  supported by sustained demand.
India FY 2017-18 marked a significant economic measure by  the government: The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was  implemented from July, 2017 as the nation moved to ‘one  nation-one tax’.
The reform measure has helped India move  into the Top 100 Club in World Bank’s ‘Global Ease of Doing  Business’ rankings.
The Indian economy continued to grow strongly, as the  economy recovered in the 2 nd half post stabilisation of the  GST regime.
Gross Domestic Product growth rate in   FY 2017-18 was 6.7%, supported by consumption growth and  government spending.
With improving investments, there  are signs that a recovery is underway.
Industrial activity  has rebounded with strong industrial production growth,  led by a rise in consumption, manufacturing and electricity  generation.
Strong vehicle sales growth and improvement  in road freight transport following stabilisation of GST  are further positive signs for continuing demand growth.
Services indicators also show positive trends with services  credit, services exports and imports clocking double   digit growth.
India remained the world’s 3 rd largest oil consuming economy  behind USA and China after overtaking Japan last year.
Its  annual demand for oil climbed by 0.12 mb/d to   4.68 mb/d.
For FY 2017-18, India’s oil demand grew at 5.3% y-o-y with  strong consumption-led demand growth in gasoline (+10.1%)  and jet fuel (+8.9%).
The growth was led by robust passenger  vehicle sales growth, two-wheelers sales growth and growth  in domestic airline passenger traffic.
Domestic diesel  demand rose at 6.6% with acceleration in industrial activity.
Polymer demand growth in India continues to be driven  by healthy economic indicators, infrastructure boost and  higher disposable income.
During the year, polyester chain  margins recovered with slower capacity growth relative to  demand growth.
This supported healthy operating rates and  favourable margins for integrated players.
43  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis Introduction of GST and emphasis on cash-less transactions  have provided a fillip to organised retail sector in India.
Organised retail has a 9% share in the overall Indian Retailing  market, providing significant growth opportunities to the  formal sector.
India’s digital services market is continuing its exponential  growth trajectory with Jio expanding its coverage and  further deepening in existing areas to achieve 99%  population coverage during FY 2018-19.
With over 186.6  million subscribers – Jio has ushered in an era of data  abundance in the nation.
The digital infrastructure created  by Jio will play a significant role in  accelerating India’s economic growth in  the coming years.
Highlights and Key Events FY 2017-18 marked the culmination  of RIL ’s largest ever petrochemical  expansion project, with the  commissioning of the Refinery Off  Gas Cracker (ROGC) and related  downstream units.
During the year, the final phase of the  Paraxylene (PX) expansion was completed and ethane  cracking at Dahej and Hazira have been stabilised.
The  projects achieved on-spec production at design capacities  in record time, a testimony to the operational excellence  of RIL ’s team.
The robust economics of these projects  reflects in sharp increase in petrochemical business earnings  during the year.
New volumes in polyester intermediates  and polymer stream, elevated polymer margins and  improving polyester chain margins were key drivers for  record petrochemical business earnings.
Refining business  environment remained constructive with strong oil demand  growth outpacing supplies, pushing global utilisation levels  higher.
Refining margins remained strong during the year  supported by healthy light distillate cracks and recovery in  middle distillate cracks.
FY 2017-18 also marked the commencement of commercial  operations of Jio.
Within a short period, Jio has transformed  the digital landscape in India, providing high-speed internet  access to 186.6 million subscribers as on 31 st March 2018.
Reliance Retail business also saw significant traction with  robust revenue growth (104.9% y-o-y) and EBIT growth  (163.3% y-o-y).
Reliance Retail added 221 stores and 3,736  Jio Points stores during the year and now operates 17.7  million sq.
ft. of retail space, the largest footprint of any  organised retailer in India.
Refining & Marketing – Third  successive year of double-digit  Refining Margins The Refining & Marketing business  reported a record EBIT of `25,869  crore during FY 2017-18 reflects  RIL ’s continuing focus on operational  efficiencies and proactive risk  management.
Though global oil prices  increased during the year, oil demand  continued to be robust in CY 2017 at 1.6 mb/d.
With limited  refining capacity additions, global refinery utilisation rates  remained high at 82.8%, supporting refinery margins.
Crude and product prices increased during the year, with  markets re-balancing amid declining inventories.
Production  restraint by OPEC and some Non-OPEC countries helped  restrict supply growth in the firm demand environment,  leading to a drawdown in crude and product inventory  levels in the OECD countries.
Firm refining margins were  underpinned by a recovery in middle distillates product  cracks with firm diesel demand on the back of recovering  industrial and mining activity.

Project management and operational excellence was  demonstrated through the rapid ramp-up of new plants to  their design capacity, with on-spec production achieved in  record time.
FY 2017-18 marked the culmination of the largest  petrochemical expansion undertaken by RIL.
Over the  course of the last three years, RIL has significantly enhanced  its capacities in key product lines and has improved its global  rankings in key products in the polyester and polymer chain.
Importantly, the new projects have materially improved RIL ’s  cost positions in these products with appropriate choice of  feedstock, technology and scale.
With the completion of  these projects, RIL ’s petrochemical portfolio has   unmatched feedstock integration and flexibility to achieve  sustainable earnings.
Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Domestic Oil & Gas RIL commenced commercial production from its Coal Bed  Methane (CBM) block in March 2017.
During the course of  the year, production was ramped up to 1 MMSCMD level with  more than 200 wells having been put to production.
Gas from  the CBM field was sold through a government mandated  competitive bidding process carried out by CRISIL.

Increase in revenue  was primarily on account of higher volumes with start-up of  petrochemicals projects and uptrend in prices of products  in the refining and petrochemical businesses.
Product  prices were led by 18% y-o-y increase in average Brent oil  price to US$57.5/bbl for the year.
Reliance’s consolidated  revenue was also boosted by robust growth in Retail and  Digital Services business.
Reliance Retail recorded a 104.9%  increase in revenue to `69,198 crore.
Digital Services  business recorded revenue of `23,916 crore in its very first  year of commercial operations.
Robust refining and petrochemicals margin environment,  volume growth in petrochemicals and rapidly increasing  contribution from consumer businesses led to significant  rise in operating profits for the year.
Operating profit before  other income and depreciation increased by 38.9% on a  y-o-y basis to `64,176 crore (US$9.8 billion) from `46,194  crore in the previous year.
Profit after tax was higher by  20.6% at `36,075 crore (US$5.5 billion) as against `29,901  crore in the previous year.
Higher interest and depreciation  charges with the commissioning of projects across  businesses resulted in relatively lower growth in   profit after tax.
`74 ,18 4 crore  Record PBDIT  * Pursuant to issue of bonus shares during the year in the ratio of 1:1 47  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis • Revenue from the Refining and Marketing segment  increased by 22.0% y-o-y to `3,06,095 crore (US$47.0 billion)  including inter segments transfers, primarily on account of  higher crude prices during the year .
Segment EBIT increased  by 3.2% to a record level of `25,869 crore (US$4.0 billion),  supported by higher Gross Refining Margins (GRM).
GRM  for the year was at a 9-year high of US$11.6/bbl as against  US$11.0/bbl in the previous year .
RIL ’s GRM outperformed  Singapore complex margins by US$4.4/bbl.
As at the end of  the year , RIL operated 1,313 petroleum retail outlets in the  country.
RIL ’s superior retail proposition reflects in the higher  offtake, with a 42% increase in MS and HSD volumes.
• Revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by  35.5% y-o-y to `1,25,299 crore (US$19.2 billion), including  inter segments transfers, primarily due to higher volumes  from new Paraxylene, ROGC and its downstream units (PE  and MEG).
Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased sharply  by 63.0% to its highest ever level of `21,179 crore (US$3.2  billion).
Earnings was supported by favourable product deltas  across integrated polyester chain, PP and PVC along with  volume growth.
EBIT margin was higher by nearly 300bps to  16.9%, reflecting RIL ’s strengthened cost positions across  product chains and unmatched feedstock flexibility.
• Revenue from the Oil and Gas segment increased by  0.3% y-o-y to `5,204 crore (US$0.8 billion), including inter  segments transfers.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice Market Environment Robust oil demand growth enabling market   re-balancing and supporting prices Global oil demand growth at 1.6 mb/d in CY 2017 remained  strong as compared to the 10-year average growth of 1.1  mb/d, even in a rising crude oil price environment.
Though  global oil demand was dominated by Non-OECD countries  with demand growing at 1.1 mb/d, demand growth was also  witnessed in relatively mature markets of OECD countries  at 0.5 mb/d.
Oil demand growth was distributed across  petroleum products, except for fuel oil, which witnessed  subdued demand.
Demand growth for diesel got strong  support from broad based economic growth across   the globe.
During CY 2017, emerging economies in Asia accounted  for close to two-third of the global oil demand growth.
Chinese oil demand growth more than doubled to 0.6 mb/d  in CY 2017 (0.3 mb/d in CY 2016).
In China, gasoline demand  growth was supported despite a slow down in the growth of  conventional vehicle sales and rising penetration of hybrids  and electric vehicles.
Diesel demand rebounded in 2017 after  a contraction in 2016 on the back of economic recovery as  well as improving mining activity.
During FY 2017-18, oil demand was also firm in India led by  gasoline, gasoil, jet fuel and LPG.

OPEC supply  contracted by 0.4 mb/d as a result of adherence to the supply  restraint deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers  as well as sharp production declines in Venezuela.
Saudi  Arabia shouldered a majority of the agreed cuts reducing its  production by 0.5 mb/d.
This was partly offset by increased  production from Libya, which was exempted from the OPEC  production cut agreement.
Non-OPEC supplies rose by 0.7 mb/d in CY 2017 after falling  by 0.7 mb/d y-o-y during CY 2016.
Supply from the US and  Canada grew by 1 mb/d in CY 2017 as crude price recovered  and US shale oil production growth returned after posting a  decline in CY 2016.
Receding Inventory Lift up Prices Brent crude oil prices averaged US$57.5/bbl in FY 2017-18,  higher by US$8.9/bbl from FY 2016-17.
Adherence to the  production restraint by OPEC and some non-OPEC members  through FY 2017-18 helped restrict oil supply growth to less  than the oil demand growth for the second consecutive year.
This led to the drawdown of crude and product inventories in  OECD countries, with stocks in these countries receding to  their lowest levels in last two years.

Global refinery utilisation remained high at  82.8% in CY 2017 as compared to a 5-year average of 81.3%.
Refining margins were also supported by unplanned refinery  outages in Americas and strength in transportation   fuel cracks.
Light distillates Light distillate cracks showed mild improvement in FY 2017- 18 supported by steady demand growth across regions.
Rising crude prices seemed to have an impact on demand  in the US, the largest gasoline market in the world, where  demand was largely flat y-o-y after strong growth in the past  4 years.
Growth in China and India remained stable.
Higher import requirement from Latin American nations  (Venezuela and Mexico) as a result of disruptions at domestic  refineries as well as supply outages in US Gulf coast due to  hurricane Harvey supported cracks.
Car sales (conventional) growth in China  slowed down in CY 2017 as a result of  Government’s push to promote new-energy  vehicles (hybrid and electric vehicles) to curb  pollution.
Gasoline demand however grew by  3% y-o-y despite these measures.
Demand for naphtha from petrochemical  sector remained firm due to stable end  product demand and favourable naphtha  cracking economics with narrower spread between   Naphtha and LPG.
Middle distillates Middle distillate cracks strengthened in FY 2017-18 over the  previous year on the back of broad based global economic  recovery supporting strong demand growth.
Middle distillate  demand growth accounted for close to half of the oil product  demand growth globally.
This was supported by recovery  in developed economies of US and Europe along with  structurally growing demand in emerging economies of Asia.
Gasoil demand in China grew by 2% in CY 2017 recovering  from a 4% contraction in the previous year.
Demand growth  in CY 2017 was led by better economic growth, improving  industrial demand and mining activity.
India gasoil demand in  FY 2017-18 also recovered strongly, growing by 6.6% y-o-y  as compared to 3% growth in the previous year.
Jet fuel demand growth remained strong aided by robust  8% growth in global international passenger traffic and 7%  growth in domestic air travel.
Indian domestic passenger  traffic remained robust, growing by 17.5% y-o-y in CY 2017.
Fuel oil Fuel oil demand declined in CY 2017 after growing for the  first time in many years in CY 2016.
Fuel oil demand from the  bunker fuel segment remained firm.
However, demand from  the power sector was impacted by natural gas substitution  in the Middle East/West Asia and North Africa during the  second half of the year.
Lower Latin American refineries  utilisation and simple refineries upgradation, especially in  Russia, supported margins.
Fuel oil cracks also strengthened  owing to OPEC oil output cut which is targeted mainly  towards medium and heavy crude grades.
Global refining environment supportive Global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.4 mb/d in   CY 2018 supported by improved global economic outlook  and strong petrochemical feedstock demand.
Higher crude  oil production from North America as well as spare capacity  available from OPEC/non-OPEC countries participating  in the production curtailment agreement is expected to  help meet demand growth and limit sharp increase in oil  price.
Gasoil demand growth is expected to stay firm on  better global economic outlook.
Gasoline demand growth is  expected to be supported by growing demand  in emerging markets aided by rising incomes.
Global refinery utilisation is expected to stay  high, supporting product cracks in CY 2018  with oil demand growth expected to outpace  refinery capacity addition.
RIL maintained premium over regional  benchmarks RIL achieved double-digit GRM for the third year in a row.
At US$11.6/bbl, refining margin was at a 9 year high.
RIL  maintained a significant premium of US$4.4/bbl over the  benchmark Singapore Complex margins.
RIL achieved  superior refining margins due to strong product cracks,  robust risk management and higher secondary unit  throughputs.
Better performance against benchmarks  was underpinned by RIL ’s ability to optimise product yields,  expand product reach based on market movement and  process a variety of crudes, including crudes from   North America.
RIL processed 8 new crude grades this year, including new  grades from North America introduced.
During the year,  65 different crude grades were processed.
Over the years,  RIL has demonstrated its ability to process challenging  crude grades with sulphur content of over 5%, Total Acid  Number (TAN) of 5 (mg KOH/g), viscosity of ~5000 cst and an  American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity as low as 10 0.
RIL fully utilised the flexibility available in its refining system  to procure competitive feedstock and optimise product  yields to improve margins.

PP margins were robust and improved  by 19% y-o-y with strong growth in demand.
PVC continues  to deliver healthy margins, supported by soft EDC prices in  the strong caustic price environment.
Tight carbide based  PVC supply due to environmental regulation in China further  strengthened PVC price fundamentals.
Rising trade tensions  between USA and China could have an impact on global trade  flows and regional polymer prices.
Polyester and Fibre Intermediates Polyester sector witnessed healthy recovery during the year  as compared to the challenging market environment in the  previous year.
Integrated polyester chain margins were on  an uptrend through the year.
Margins for the year improved  across the polyester and intermediates business, leading to a  5 year high chain margin across the polyester chain.
RIL benefitted from its integrated presence across the  polyester chain.
While margins shifted within the elements  of the chain, with a notable uptick in PTA-PX margins,  integrated chain margins improved significantly during  the year.
Capacity addition in upstream contributed to  improved integrated chain margins for Reliance with reduced  dependency on feedstock sourcing.
Polyester fibre and yarn markets were able to pass on  fluctuation in the upstream markets due to low inventory  levels and high operating rates.
Polyester inventories in  China remained low after the first quarter which supported  the markets as fabric transactions in China remained healthy,  averaging higher volumes than the last two years.
Global  polyester demand in 2017 increased by a robust 3 MMT,  a similar gain was last seen in 2011, as against a capacity  growth of 2.6 MMT.
China has in the past few years tightened environment  protection norms and enforced regulations to control  industrial pollution.
In 2017, China restricted imports of solid  waste into China, whereby it targeted to completely ban  imports of solid waste (including PET) from 2018.
Recycled  PET is majorly used for producing PSF (Polyester Staple  Fibre), which consequently witnessed a sharp price gain  towards 3Q FY 2017-18.
PSF prices touched US$1255/MT,  highest since 2015, and consequently delta also firmed up.
59  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis Jamnagar Manufacturing Division International cotton prices improved 8% y-o-y during FY  2017-18.
Cotton to polyester price differential remained  healthy touching highest levels since 2011, favouring  polyester in blending.
Global cotton acreage in 2017-18  (Aug-Jul) is expected to rise amidst increased consumption.
However, Indian cotton production is likely to be impacted  due to increasing pest issues.
Global PET prices for the year increased by 14% y-o-y to  US$1065/ MT with tight supplies due to curtailed output  and good demand.
Global PET demand remained healthy  amidst firm beverage consumption from major developed  and emerging economies, CY 2017 PET capacity increased  by 1.2 MMT y-o-y against a demand growth of 0.8 MMT,  however, disruptions in few western capacities resulted in  tight markets.

On the supply side, delays in the startup of a  couple of PTA plants in China, plant outages and shutdowns  supported prices and margins.
Both PTA and MEG markets  faced tight inventory levels for a major part of the year.
PTA margins improved significantly during the year,  encouraging restart of idled units and startup of new units  during the year.
CY 2017 witnessed demand growth of 3 MMT  with capacity addition of 1.9 MMT.
MEG markets remained strong with a sharp rise of 23% y-o-y  in prices and 26% y-o-y in margins.
Firm ethylene prices  supported positive trends in MEG markets, with prices  touching the highest levels in 4 years.
During CY 2017, net  global capacity addition of 1 MMT was lower than demand  growth of 1.4 MMT.
During the year, Reliance commissioned  its new MEG capacity in Jamnagar.
The new capacity is  running at optimum throughput and the additional volume  has been absorbed in domestic and export markets.
PX market witnessed oversupply in the initial part of the  year with slower than anticipated offtake from downstream  PTA market.
This was due to delay in start-ups and restarts  of idle PTA plants.
Consequently, gains in upstream energy  markets overshadowed rise in PX prices, affecting the deltas  during the year.
CY 2017 PX capacity increased by 3MMT and  witnessed demand growth of 1.9 MMT.
However, PTA start- ups pushed up demand for PX towards the end of the year,  supporting higher operating rates.
Elastomers Global Natural Rubber production witnessed growth  of 7% y-o-y to 13.4 MMT in 2017, while demand growth  was 4% y-o-y to 13.1 MMT.
The excess supply of natural  rubber weighed on price fundamentals during the year.
Environmental restriction in China led to reduction in  downstream operation of elastomers industry, which  resulted in shortage of carbon black and limited   tyre production.
Global capacity of butadiene continues to remain stable at 15  MMTA with average operating rate of around 77% in CY 2017.
The key application for butadiene is in the manufacturing  of PBR and SBR.
With more light feed crackers coming up  -mainly in the US, the incremental availability of Butadiene  is expected to be limited.
The global capacity of PBR is 4.8  MMTA in 2017 with average utilisation rate of 70%.
The global  capacity of SBR is 7.1 MMTA in 2017 with average utilisation  rate of 67%.
PBR and SBR demand are directly linked to growth in  the automobile and tyre sector.
During CY 2017 , global  passenger car production grew at 2.3% and commercial  vehicles production grew strongly by 5.3% y-o-y.
The  operating rates of both PBR and SBR are expected to   improve in near future amid growing demand and limited  capacity addition.
Domestic Scenario Polymers Indian polymer sector was impacted during the first half of  FY 2017-18 due to GST implementation.
Demand revived  post stabilisation of the GST regime.
For the full year, India’s  polymer market registered a healthy 7% growth y-o-y.
Demand growth was driven by higher economic activity,  rising disposable income levels, increased spending on  infrastructure and uptrend in the packaging and automobiles  sector.
India is among the world’s fastest growing polymer  markets with a five-year CAGR (2012-17) of 9.1%.
India is the  second largest demand hub for polymer in Asia after China,  accounting for 11% of the Asian consumption.
PP recorded 10% y-o-y demand growth supported by  healthy consumption across all segments, including raffia  packaging, non-woven, multifilament, automotive, hygiene  applications and appliances.
PE demand was higher by  9% y-o-y owing to strong offtake from flexible packaging,  moulded products (e.g.
portable toilets – driven by “Swachh  Bharat Abhiyan”) and paper/woven sacks lamination  packaging sector.
PVC demand recovered towards the end of  the year and posted a growth of 2% in FY 2017-18.

Prasad With the steady ramp-up of production from the Coal Bed Methane (CBM) fields, in Sohagpur, Reliance is set to  become India’s largest producer of unconventional natural gas.
To sustain the production, the second phase of  development has also commenced.
Reliance continues to focus on value preservation in the North America Shale Gas business.
As part of portfolio  rationalisation, Reliance and its JV partner Carrizo sold their stake in the Marcellus shale plays to Kalnin Ventures.
Reliance and its partner Pioneer sold part of their acreage in the West Eagle Ford shale play.
Reliance conducts its operations responsibly with a track record of over 10 years of safe operations, at par with the  best in the world.
Market Environment 2017 was a turbulent year for the global oil & gas industry  driven by changing demand-supply equations coupled with  geo-political issues resulting in steady increase in crude  prices.
Brent prices ranged from US$45/bbl in June to ~US$64/bbl  by the end of the year.
Average West Texas Intermediate  (WTI) crude oil prices for 2017 was also higher 18% y-o-y  averaging at US$50.95/bbl, US Natural Gas prices remained  strong and Henry Hub (HH) Gas price stayed close to or  above US$3/MMBTU for most of the year.
Encouraging  demand from LNG and Mexican exports coupled with  subdued supplies supported higher gas prices.
With respect to Shale Gas operations, WTI and HH prices  were higher y-o-y, with WTI oil prices 18% higher at  US$50.95/bbl in CY 2017 and HH Gas prices 26% higher at  US$3.11/MMBTU.
Also, gas and condensate benchmark  differentials improved.
Upstream capital spending is expected to grow in 2018.
Major project FIDs are expected to come in unconventional  and deep-water areas (Brazil and GOM), with Operators  taking advantage of oversupply in the service sector to lock  in at lower costs.
Indian Regulatory Environment During the last year, there have been many initiatives by  the Government of India to promote the Indian Oil & Gas  industry.
• Policy framework for early monetisation of CBM, which  provided complete Marketing and Pricing freedom for CBM  gas and eased operational issues • Launch of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP), which  provides options for operators to select exploration areas on  their own rather than wait for formal bid rounds Financial and Operational Performance* FY 2017-18 (` in crore) FY 2017-18 (US$ in million) FY 2016-17 (` in crore) % Change Revenues 5,204 798.5 5,191 0.3% EBIT (1,536) (235.7) (1,584) EBIT (%) (29.5%) (30.5%) *consolidated For FY 2017-18, revenues increased by 0.3% to `5,204  crore.
This marginal change was on account of better price  realisations and ramp-up of production in CBM which were  partly offset by decline in production in KG D6 and Shale Gas.
Consequently, upstream operations registered negative  EBIT of `(1,536) crore.
Naresh Narang Sanjay B.

KG  D6 operations continue to achieve field  uptime of 100%, which continues to  be the global standard for deep water  facilities.
The major challenges faced  are associated with reservoir depletion,  sand and water influx.
Reliance’s near term aim is to maintain wells flowing and  sustain production until future projects are commissioned.
This involves effective reservoir and production  management to overcome network and operational  challenges.
For enhancing recovery and flow assurance, Onshore  Terminal Booster Compressor Low Low Pressure (OTBC LLP)  project has been commissioned.
This project will help sustain  D1D3 field production by extending life of flowing wells and  revival of D1D3 shut-in wells.
Panna-Mukta-Tapti Panna-Mukta field produced 5.4 million barrel of crude, a  reduction of ~13% on y-o-y basis and 62.1 BCF of natural  gas, a reduction of 3% on y-o-y basis.
The fall in production  is owing to natural decline in the field, shut in of wells due to  equipment issues and unplanned shutdown of the field due  to cyclone Ockhi.
Loss in production was partially offset by  better production optimisation and revival of wells closed  due to integrity issues.
The PSC for Panna-Mukta Block is  scheduled to expire in December 2019.
Having reviewed the future potential and  risk profile, the JV partners have taken  a view of not to progress on seeking  extension of the contract and are  currently making necessary preparation  for handover of the assets to the Government’s nominee on  expiry of the PSC.
T apti assets are under decommissioning.
Plugging and  abandonment of all the T apti wells has been completed.
Decommissioning activities for the associated facilities have  been initiated.
CBM (Sohagpur East & Sohagpur West) Reliance commenced commercial production from its Coal  Bed Methane (CBM) block SP (West)–CBM–2001/1 in March  2017.
More than 200 wells were put on production with  production ramp-up crossing the 1 MMSCMD level during  the year.
CBM Reservoirs are initially 100% saturated with water.
At the  start of production, the wells will go through the ‘Dewatering  Phase’.
In the dewatering phase of CBM production, water is  pumped out continuously to increase gas saturation in the  reservoir, resulting in ramp up of gas production from these  wells.
The wells put on production have been predominantly  in dewatering phase this year and the production ramp-up  in next 6 -12 months is expected to make RIL the largest  unconventional natural gas producer in India.
Reliance Gas Pipeline Limited, a subsidiary of RIL,  commissioned the 302 km Shahdol-Phulpur Pipeline from  Shahdol (MP) to Phulpur (UP).
This pipeline connects the  CBM Gas fields with the Indian Gas Grid providing access to  consumers across the country.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice Control-cum-Riser Platform – KG D6 Marketing of CBM gas For the development of alternate sources of natural gas  including Coal Bed Methane, GoI notified marketing and  pricing freedom to the Coal Bed Methane (CBM) in April 2017.
The reform measure allows CBM producers to sell the CBM  at Arm’s Length Price in the domestic market through a  fully transparent and competitive bidding process with the  objective of obtaining best possible prices.
RIL hired CRISIL to carry out a fully transparent and  competitive bidding process with the objective of  maximising price for sale of CBM Gas.
Three rounds of  bidding process were carried out this year.
The first two  rounds of bidding were for short duration.
The third round  of bidding, carried out in September 2017, was for sale of  CBM gas till FY 2020-21.
These were the first open market,  transparent competitive auctions for CBM gas sales in India.
North American Shale Gas Operations Production Performance JV production Units of  measurement  CY 2017  CY 2016 Gas BCF 111.8 130.3 Condensate MMBBL 4.7 7.3 Industry Background US Shale Gas industry has shown remarkable resilience in  recent past and has leveraged the down turn to improve  operational efficiencies and to reduce services costs.
The  advancement in shale technology was a key success factor  in both basins (wells with longer laterals and improved  completion designs).
With improved cost structure and  improved outlook on prices, activity picked up and rig counts  increased in select shale plays (including Eagle Ford and  Marcellus) during 2017 .
Business Performance The Company continued with its prudent strategy to  improve the value of the remaining development inventory  and securing overall cost leadership.
As part of this strategy, the portfolio was rationalised:  Reliance Marcellus II LLC, a subsidiary of the company  that held assets in the Carrizo joint development; signed a  Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) on 5 th October, 2017  with BKV Chelsea, LLC for sale of its assets in Susquehanna,  Clearfield and Wyoming counties effective 1 st April, 2017, for  an initial consideration of US$126 MM subject to customary  adjustments.
Additionally, Reliance II LLC would be entitled  to receive additional contingent consideration of upto  US$11.25 MM upon certain conditions being met as per PSA.
The transaction closed on 21 st November, 2017.
Reliance’s aggregate capital investments across JVs  remained stable and was US$209 MM during CY 2017.
For 2018, the thrust remains on preserving long-term value  through high-grading of land and development portfolio,  retaining optionality, improving efficiency and well costs,  as well as optimisation of well spacing and completions for  enhanced recoveries.
Operational Performance At Pioneer JV, drilling and completion activities commenced  at the end of 1st quarter of CY17 with the objective of testing  new well design (down spaced wells with longer laterals and  more intense frac’ing).
At Chevron JV, there was no drilling  and completion activity in the JV operated areas, while there  was activity, in the non-operated areas.
The joint ventures  drilled 23 wells and put 41 wells on production.
Thus there  were 1,129 wells producing by the end of CY 2017.

Reliance’s share of production and sales were  at 139.7 BCFe and 121.4 BCFe, respectively in CY 2017,  compared to 174.0 BCFe and 150.4 BCFe in CY 2016.
Pioneer JV At Eagle Ford, development activities commenced as the  JV tested wells with new well design that involves higher  intensity well completion and changed well spacing, with  encouraging initial results.
JV drilled 11 wells while it frac’ed  and put on production 20 wells during  H2 2017.
The 2017 wells were very  successful.
With limited activity and  natural decline of the existing wells,  year average Gross JV production was  35% down at 118 BCFe compared to 181  BCFe in CY 2016, while Reliance share  of net sales volume was at 47.5 BCFe  compared to 72.9 BCFe in CY 2016.
The  share of liquids improved slightly from 65.2% to 67.0% in  CY 2017.
Reliance and its partner Pioneer sold part of their  acreage in the West Eagle Ford shale play which was not part  of near term development plan.
Chevron JV Progress on pad optimisation and on well designs combined  with progress towards Upper Quartile (notably well costs and  LOE) were key achievements during 2017.
This has set stage  for restarting development activity in JV operated areas  during CY 2018.
Year average gross JV production declined by 5% to 159  BCFe from 166 BCFe in CY2016, reflecting slowdown in  activity despite improved operational efficiency and strong  well performance.
Reliance share of net Sales volume stood  at 55.0 BCFe, compared to 56.7 BCFe in CY 2016.
Carrizo JV Prior to the sale in November 2017, gross JV production was 39  BCFe as compared to 43 BCFe in CY 2016, while Reliance share of  net sales was at 19 BCFe  compared to 21 BCFe in 2016.
Exploration Outlook Fuel strategy and energy basket Future energy outlook indicates deliberate shift towards  cleaner fuels.
There has been a revision in target  investments by industry majors under the new business  environment.
Natural gas, being cleaner,  is an ideal transition fuel and stranded  resources of gas in Indian basins form a  good investment option.
Considering the price forecast and  low carbon economy, RIL ’s exploration  targets are aligned to prepare for the  future by improving efficiency and  leveraging integrated business model.
The key components  of the strategy include: • Sustain production and expeditiously develop discovered  resource base • Safe and reliable commissioning and operation of the fields  • Maximise recovery and value generation Technology & Innovations In FY 2017-18, focus was on upgrading systems and  technologies in light of upcoming deepwater development  projects, so that the “Upcoming Fields” are digitally enabled in  all possible manner .

Bio-CBM To increase recovery from CBM fields, Reliance has engaged  in R&D efforts in addition to the established methods.
Current focus of this research is Bio-CBM.
In CBM, methane gas which is adsorbed and trapped  naturally in coal seams is produced.
Bio-CBM technology  uses microbe injection to produce in-situ methane where  either the coals are devoid of methane or conventional CBM  extraction is uneconomical.
Currently this technology is in nascent stage and the initial  lab tests has shown encouraging results with respect to  methane production potential.
Further work is planned  to establish ability of this technology to scale up to a  commercial operation.
Reliance is leveraging its infrastructure (advance  laboratories), diverse inter-disciplinary technical skills,  CBM production expertise, CBM fields and knowledge of  regulatory requirements to give impetus to the Bio-CBM  research.

The pace and  reach of this is likely to get faster exponentially.
The majority of voice calls have already moved to next  generation mobile network at almost negligible cost coupled  with rich communication services and plethora of infotainment  and commerce applications.
Now, it is the turn of home and  wireless broadband convergence to drive an all pervasive  Internet of Things (IoT) and fully enabled digital life.
Digitisation and data consumption in India were subdued  because of inadequate investment in infrastructure, lack  of credible competitive environment coupled with steep  pricing.
Jio’s entry not only unlocked existent latent demand,  but also consumption patterns leading to exponential  increase in per capita data consumption.
Government’s  strong policy framework and push towards ‘Digital India’  have immensely helped in accelerating the shift towards  digital economy and society.
FY 2017-18 witnessed several important and transformative  changes in the Industry.
The industry is going through  a major consolidation phase through mergers or sale of  businesses and from earlier 8 plus players is heading towards  a 3 to 4 player market.
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has set a  definitive path towards eliminating Interconnect Usage  Charges (IUC) by 2020, while reducing the extant charge of 14  paise per minute to 6 paise per minute.
This not only removes  the artificial tariff hurdle with floor price but also allows  faster adoption of more efficient technologies like VoLTE, as  erstwhile legacy networks are nearing obsolescence.
This,  along with reduction in international calling terminal rates  to 30 paise per minute from earlier 53 paise per minute, is  beneficial for the end customer, while promoting technology  and services which have almost negligible cost for carrying  and servicing essential services like voice.
This is also a clear indication of the industry’s maturity  and sets a clear forward path enabling quick adoption and  implementation of digital technologies, which Jio has   been pioneering.

For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice Digital transformation across the value chain India has become an epitome of digital transformation,  driven by various private and public initiatives.
During the  last few years, technological advancement coupled with  transformative initiatives by Jio, is enabling availability of  affordable broad band internet plans.
This has provided the  required impetus for increasing internet usage in India.
India currently has over ~450 million internet subscribers  (CAGR of ~42% over FY 2006), making it the second largest  online market in the world, ranked only behind China.
However, the overall internet penetration is still at 34%,  skewed in favour of urban India, which has ~76% internet  penetration.
Rural India is still underpenetrated with only  15% penetration.
With a total rural population of ~906  million, approximately 750 million users still do not    use internet.

As per EIU forecast, Indian households have been witnessing  an upwards increase in their disposable income since the  last few years.
Deloitte predicts that rising affluence of  households will lead to an increased demand for consumer  goods, entertainment systems, etc.
which will further  drive demand for internet services.
Hence, these untapped  households will represent the next wave for internet   growth in India.
Mobile    Desktop/Laptop   T ablet Mobile Phone continues to be the preferred  primary device driving internet usage  (in Million) Urban 77 17 6 Rural 92 7 1 Even though the mobile industry’s contribution to the  country’s GDP currently stands at 6.5% (USD 140 billion) 2,  Indian telecom industry hitherto had monolithic approach  towards consumer, with limited innovation or collaboration  that drives eco-system benefits to the end consumer.
Over the last few years, increase in internet penetration has  been driven mostly by availability of cheaper smartphones  or through narrow band wireless access.
More than 92% of  rural users (substantially through limited wireless narrow  band access) and 77% urban users have been using mobile as  a primary device for accessing internet through cellular data  connections.
India would be leading the data revolution in the coming  years as the largely untapped market slowly gets included  into the realms of digital services.
Celebrating Digital Life 89  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis In early 2016, India became the second largest smartphone  market in the world, trailing China and overtaking the  US with about 250 million smartphone users.
The  telecommunications market in India is characterised by  an urban-rural divide, which is manifested by an urban tele  density three times higher than that of rural.
This explains  the high smartphone user concentration in urban cities and  an overall low smartphone penetration in the country.
The  current smartphone penetration in the country stands at  as low as ~35%.
The top 30 cities make up 51% of the entire  smartphone market in India.
With the increasing availability of affordable telecom  services and handsets in the market and the numerous  Government initiatives to connect the unconnected,  Deloitte predicts that India is poised to be at the forefront of  the global data revolution with the introduction of bundle- based sales of smartphones with net effective price less than  US$ 25 and data rates at less than US$ 1 per GB.

A number of remarkable innovations were used to achieve this seamless and technology driven transition to  the new tax regime which included development and setting up an in-house GST Suvidha Provider as JioGST to serve  not only Group entities but also the larger tax community.
A robotic system has also been developed in-house for  generation of E-way bills.
Phase 1 of Driverless GST will be the lodestone and foundation for a future 100% touchless  system of IDT compliances in the next Phase.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice Market Environment During the first half of FY 2017-18, India’s Media and  entertainment (M&E) sector encountered substantial  headwinds due to short-term impact from implementation  of tax reforms.
In the second half, the industry gathered  momentum owing to a sharp revival led by robust underlying  content-consumption trends.
The pullback in advertising  spends in first half dragged down ad-growth for the year to  3%, but the market is well on its way to recovery heading into  FY 2018-19 (Source: EY-FICCI Frames report, 2018).
India’s M&E industry is expected to grow at an 11.6% CAGR  to reach `2,032 billion by 2020, from its estimated size of  `1,306 billion in 2016 (Source: EY-FICCI Frames report,  2018).
This growth will be driven by India’s need for escapism,  knowledge and social acceptance.
Size & Growth CAGR of M&E segments   2016   2020   CAGR TV Digital M&E Industry 9.8 24.9 11.6 594 1308 92 862 2032 224 Growth drivers 1)  Recovery in economic growth, reforms, and resultant  socio-economic upliftment:  Advertising contributes  to the bulk of M&E sector revenues in India.
It is largely  influenced by the broader economic cycle, and a revival  post two years of weak ad-spends led by macro-events.
2)  TV viewership continues to grow at a fast clip, despite  the advent of digital:  India’s TV content consumption  is on a rise, led by demographic/socio-economic  tailwinds (as measured by BARC), despite the advent of  Digital content.
Thus, the conclusion is that Digital is  complementary and not cannibalistic to TV’s content in  India today.
Moreover, TV penetration in India reached  64%, taking the total number of TV viewing household  to 183 million in 2017 (recording a 3.5% growth over the  previous year).
TV owning  Households (mn) TV  Penetration 7.5 mn+ towns 20 94% 1-7.5 mn+ towns 19 91% 0.1-1 mn+ towns 22 87% <0.1 mn+ towns 24 79% Rural 99 52% All India 183 64% 3)  Segmentation of market from a genre, geography and  pricing perspective:  Content providers are creating new  channels across genres.
They are incubating segmented  offerings for catering to a certain demographic, and  digging deeper into attracting regional eyeballs through  vernacular content; thereby expanding the market itself.
4)  Digital as a new medium of personalised and  untethered content consumption:  The rapid  advancement in telecom technology, especially 4G  services, coupled with slashed data costs due to  99  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis competition has created a completely new channel of  content consumption through handheld devices.
5)   Free-To-Air (FTA) channels as a low-cost entry- point for a vast multitude of Indians:  FTA channels  resonate with a large Indian population who do not have  the capacity to pay for content.
FTA channels have  grown rapidly over the last couple of years led by BARC  measuring rural content consumption and creating an  untapped advertising market.
6)  Regional content consumption gaining strength:   Data from BARC indicates that growth in content  consumption in languages like Punjabi, Oriya, Bhojpuri,  Assamese and Gujarati is almost twice the rate of growth  of languages like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and others.
7)   Digitisation – ‘See your customer’:  With the  introduction of digitisation, the revenue dynamics of  content distribution have changed.
Due to enhanced  transparency at the local cable operator level, multi- system operators (distributor aggregators) and  broadcasters have gained.
Financial and operational performance Financial Overview Particulars FY 2017-18 (` in crore) FY 2016-17 (` in crore) % Change   y-o-y Revenues 1,839 1,491 23.3% EBIT (25) (201) Network18 consolidated its operations and continued  to enhance its prominence in the M&E sector during a  challenging year for the industry.
The M&E segment  witnessed a short-term pull-back in advertising spends on  account of structural reforms like implementation of Goods  and Services Tax (GST).
This influenced advertising revenue  early in the year, but the impact waned off by the end of  the fiscal, triggering a sharp revival.
Telecom Regulatory  Authority of India’s (TRAI) tariff order on a-la-carte selling of  channels remained sub-judice, which added to the pressures  of FTA channels and Digital platforms on the TV subscription  business.
However, macro tailwinds like a recovering  economy, growing TV consumption and cable digitisation  remain intact.
In such an industry landscape, despite  competitive pressures Network18 reported revenues worth  `1,839 crore and EBIT of `(25) crore on a consolidated basis.
The sharp revenue escalation is led by the impact of  subsidiary TV18 acquiring control of entertainment JV  Viacom18, partly offset by HomeShop18 ceasing to be a  subsidiary due to its share-swap acquisition of ShopCJ  during the last quarter of the fiscal.
On a comparable  basis (by consolidating Viacom18 and deconsolidating  HomeShop18 throughout), Network18 revenue rose 16%  in FY 2017-18 to `5,027 crore.
Comparable (restated) EBIT  also rose to `84 crore, compared to `(46) crore last fiscal,  led by reduction in losses in home-shopping, a stellar year  for movie production, and gains on fair valuation of financial  assets.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice Innovation Moneycontrol has introduced various innovative delivery  methods like live streaming, podcasts, video-on-demand  and so on.
Besides, Moneycontrol is now truly an on-the- move destination with the availability of its app on smart  watches as well.
With an ad-free paid app being launched,  Moneycontrol now truly reaches a premium customer base  with a more refined offering.
News18.com, besides being available in nine Indian  languages, continued its focus on intense editorial and  product innovation.
The platform consistently offered rich  data driven election coverage.
The successful REEL awards  showcased its ability to diversify its revenue steam, while  differentiating itself from competition.
Firstpost has further diversified its offerings through the  launch of FirstCricket (a one-stop destination for cricket  enthusiasts) and ShowSha.com (an integrated entertainment  and cultural destination).
VOOT’s PWA (Progressive Web App) is a class-leading tech  innovation, where Network18 worked closely with Google  engineers to create a mobile-website, which provides an app  experience even through a browser.
This opens up the target  market to beyond smartphones and even include feature  phones (which still dominate India’s telecom landscape), as  apps cannot be used in earlier generation feature phones.
Risks Regulatory changes:  The TRAI tariff order on a-la-carte  sale of channels could change the subscription business  model substantially, thereby ushering a period of flux for  the industry as all participants adjust.
It could create both  opportunities and challenges.
Digital investments: The digital content and digital  commerce businesses do not have a settled monetisation  model today.
Substantial investments by international and  domestic players to capture the Indian market are leading to  cash-burn.
This scenario may turn into a drag on profitability  for some time.
Outlook Network18’s growth aspirations stem from an inherently  high-quality portfolio of properties, a relentless drive  for garnering market-share, and a concerted effort to  utilise synergies and push efficiencies across its owned  and affiliate media (traditional and digital) and telecom  portfolio.

RIL has constituted an ‘Environmental  Compliance Review Committee’ at each manufacturing  location that reviews environmental performances every  quarter, to go beyond compliance.
Reliance has formulated  the ‘Environment Policy’, which states that protection of  the environment is of prime concern.
The policy addresses  issues related to the employees, contractors, suppliers  and customers.
The Company has installed Continuous  Emission and Effluent Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for  monitoring emissions and discharges at the refinery and  petrochemical units and this is continuously reported  to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
There are no  pending or unresolved show cause/ legal notices received  from CPCB or State Pollution Control Board (SPCB).
Life  Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of polypropylene products  were conducted at three manufacturing locations to  understand the overall environmental footprint of these  products.
The manufacturing sites have adopted ‘Integrated  Management System’ complying with Environment (ISO-  14001), Quality (ISO-9001) and Occupational Health and  Safety Management Systems (OHSAS-18001).
A dedicated  team works relentlessly to identify and implement energy  conservation initiatives, resource optimisation and  renewable energy projects at all RIL ’s manufacturing sites.
Clean Air Energy Efficiency  A) Efficiency improvement:   At design stage:  1)  ROGC: RIL has successfully commissioned and  achieved design throughput of the world’s first ever  and largest ROGC complex of 1.5 MMTPA capacity  along with downstream plants and utilities.
It  reduced energy intensity of ROGC to 6100 BTU/ lb  HVC (British Thermal Units per pound of High Value  Chemicals).
2)  MEG: RIL integrated three equipment namely,  Ethylene Oxide (EO) stripper, EO re-absorber and  light ends column, resulting in reduced energy  consumption.
3)  Ethane Import: Reliance is the first company to  globally conceptualise large-scale imports of ethane  from North America as feedstock for its cracker  portfolio in India.
Cryogenic integration of ethane  handling facility with the cracker complex reduces  load on its propylene and ethylene refrigeration  systems, and in turn, significantly lowers energy  consumption by about 1000 BTU/lb of HVC.
At plant / site level:  1)  RIL deployed energy modelling tools for steam,  power, and process units thereby reducing  emissions.
2)  RIL reduced unaccounted loses by continuous  monitoring of flaring and energy performance of  manufacturing plants and minimised flaring of  hydrocarbons by incorporating innovative measures  with relevant hardware.
At equipment level:   1)  RIL modified gas turbines to operate more efficiently  with Syngas.
2)  RIL replicated the success seen with advanced  technologies like Divided Wall Column (DWC) to  equipment at other plants.
Culture of energy saving at shop floor level Action Taken:  At the Hazira plant, it was  observed that pressure  fluctuations in operations of  the benzene column caused  a reduction in heat recovery  to the naphtha stream.
Thus,  a new control valve with  a split range control was  used to minimise pressure  variations.
Consequently,  heat recovery from the  benzene column overhead  was increased.
Outcome:  Continuous  improvement in energy  efficiency through process  modification.
111  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis B)   Re-engineering feedstock value chain (Integrated  thinking - emission reduction with enhanced business  performance)   ROGC and Pet Coke Gasification (PCG) are pivotal  to the latest expansion of manufacturing prowess at  the Jamnagar Manufacturing Division (JMD).
While  the refinery off gas is used as feedstock to produce  ethylene and propylene, pet coke gasification aids in  supplying Syngas as fuel.
Hydrogen gas, produced as a  by-product in PCG, is used as utility in the refinery and  avoids operation of some energy-intensive Hydrogen  Manufacturing Units (HMUs).
Following this expansion,  because of its top quartile performance, JMD will be the  ‘last man standing refinery’ when it boils down to survival  of the fittest.
Jamnagar refineries have top decile Nelson Complexity  Index (a metric for quantifying and ranking the  complexity of refineries) of 12.7.
The complexity level  of Jamnagar site is expected to improve significantly  by several notches with the commissioning J3 projects.
The NCI is a measure of comparing the secondary  conversion capacity of a petroleum refinery with the  primary distillation capacity.
The index provides a metric  for quantifying and ranking the complexity of various  refineries and units.
Air Emissions    RIL regularly monitors emissions as it is a part of its  environmental management plan.
In addition to green  house gas emissions, the Company closely monitors  the emissions of Total Particulate Matter (TPM), Oxides  of Sulphur (SOx) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx).
During  FY 2017-18, RIL implemented various initiatives for  emissions reduction, which are listed in Annexure VI  of Boards’ Reports.
All petrochemicals and refinery  sites have commissioned CEMS (Continuous Emission  Monitoring Systems).
RIL has identified material topics related to climate  change through a structured materiality assessment  process in accordance with the GRI Standards.
In its  Sustainability Report, RIL discloses the management  strategy to combat risks and seize opportunities and  information on performance of these material topics.
RIL has registered eight CDM projects with the United       Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC).
These projects are related to energy  efficiency, use of renewable energy and cleaner fuels.
The Company has built in-house capacity to develop  CDM projects and obtain registration and issuance of  the same in the form of Certified Emission Reductions  (CERs) from the UNFCCC.
Clean Water   Best-in-class technology at JMD enables desalination of  sea water, thereby saving water from fresh water sources.
RIL ensures that all wastewater generated is treated and  exceeds all state and central regulatory requirements.
RIL encourages its sites to enhance water reusability and  recyclability by making process modifications.
The Company  has made focused efforts to recycle substantial quantities of  wastewater from processes across manufacturing locations.
Continuous improvements have enabled RIL to increase  y-o-y recyclability of process water despite increasing  standards of environmental compliance.
Some manufacturing locations are already zero-discharge  sites and the Company aims to achieve zero-discharge  status at all its operating locations.
RIL has commissioned Sea Water based Reverse Osmosis  (SWRO) plants to convert sea water for industrial use at  JMD.
Together, with the thermal desalination units, SWRO  plants enable generation of over 90 MGD (million gallons per  day) generation of fresh water with optimal utilisation from  the energy integration stand-point.
JMD has achieved zero  freshwater withdrawal by implementing design efficiency.
Preventing Soil Contamination   RIL takes conscious efforts to use resources as efficiently  as possible and simultaneously works towards reducing  Reduction in fresh water consumption   by design Action Taken:  At the Hoshiarpur  Manufacturing Division,  water consumption was  reduced by utilising treated  ETP water for horticulture.
Outcome:  During the year,  a total of 12,720 m3 of water  was saved on account of this  initiative.
Waste to value through co-processing Action Taken:  Manufacturing plants  typically generate several  types of wastes during  manufacturing processes  & shutdown periods.
These wastes have high  calorific values.
The  Company explored various  possibilities and through  experimentation, finally used  co-processing of waste.
Outcome:  Diligent use of  resources and lower landfill.
Reducing material intensity through 100%  recycled products Action Taken:  PET bottles, which are non- biodegradable in nature,  after disposal, lead to  environmental degradation.
Recron Green Gold, a  polyester staple fibre, is  produced by a highly eco- friendly process, Apart from  being made from 100%  recycled PET bottles, it also  uses 90% recycled water.
Outcome:  RIL is recycling  about 60,000 tonnes/year of  polyester waste with more  than 2 billion post-consumer  PET bottles per year.
This  results in removal of non- biodegradable waste from  the environment and diligent  use of scarce resources.

129  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis R&D – Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Ionic liquids replacing Hydrofluoric Acid RIL has developed an Ionic Liquid (IL)-based catalyst  process technology to replace the Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)  in the manufacturing of Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB).
HF is  potentially hazardous and can be replaced with the Ionic  Liquid.
Customer trials are underway based on the material  produced at pilot plant.
The Company’s two commercial LAB  manufacturing units, in Patalganga and Vadodara, will be  converted from licensed HF-based technology to inhouse  IL-based technology.
RIL has patented IL technology.
Slag waste to chemicals Hydro process, requires large quantity of acid or alkali for  leaching or the pyro process, which involves very high  temperature i.e.
above 1700 0C.
RIL has developed a low cost  low temperature hybrid green process to extract vanadium  from gasifier slag.
The green process is being scaled up from  lab to pilot.
Direct conversion of CO2 to Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) RIL and CSIR have jointly developed a mixed oxide stable  catalyst to directly convert methanol and CO 2 to a high value  product e.g.
DMC.
Until now, DMC production is being done  through non-green phosgene process which inherently  results in high cost of production.
Thus various application  of DMC including its use as additive for gasoline gets ruled  out.
DMC is also the gateway for making polycarbonate and  thus of high strategic value.
DMC used as fuel allows for  economical methanol consumption without the demerits  of direct use of methanol in Internal Combustion (IC)  engine.
The joint process and catalyst has been tested on a  continuous scale, providing stable operation.
A strategy for  scaling up is being explored.
Hydrodesulphurisation (HDS) and Hydrodenitrogenation  (HDN) of fuel products Government regulations and environmental standards  on sulphur content in fuels are becoming more stringent.
Reliance is working on new Ionic Liquids (IL) to produce  cleaner fuel using chemical processes which operate at  moderate conditions to remove sulphur and nitrogen  species that are difficult to remove in traditional HDS /  HDN processes.
The indigenous process can be easily  incorporated in the existing hydro-treating plant and can  help in producing cleaner fuel.

Reliance’s Materiality Assessment Approach As a key strategic focus area, sustainability is crucial to the  delivery of the Group’s strategy and is integrated across  all areas of business.
RIL conducts a formal materiality  assessment in accordance with GRI Standards to identify  and prioritise the most significant sustainability topics, set  KPIs and targets for improvement that guide the content  of Sustainability Report.
The KPIs and management  approach for identified material topics undergo a monthly  review through the sustainability council, which advises on  improvement measures and action plans.
Additionally, an  annual review is conducted by the Board committee.
RIL ’s materiality assessment involves the process of  identifying and assessing numerous potential economic,  environmental and social topics that could affect its business  and stakeholders and prioritise them into key material  topics.
The identification of material issues has been largely  aligned to the Company’s risk management framework and  its strategic approach based on the four areas: • Strategic and Commercial risks • Safety and Operations • Compliance and Control • Financial risks Reliance aims to build strong and long-lasting relationships  with its stakeholders through structured dialogues.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice “A disciplined approach to risk is important in a diversified organisation like Reliance to enable the achievement of its  strategic objectives and to ensure that Reliance has an acceptable level of risk commensurate to expected returns.
Reliance’s  Enterprise Risk Management framework drives a consistent and systematic approach for identifying and managing risks,  both at the strategic and operational levels.
Reliance’s integrated risk management framework provides the capability  for timely and informed response to address risks and to capture opportunities”.
“Reliance has a comprehensive Reliance  Management System, a holistic set of management systems, organisational structures, processes, policies and governance  framework.
During the year, significant progress has been made with driving a risk aware culture through integrating the  risk process into planning and decision - making processes, assigning clear accountabilities for risk ownership and ongoing  oversight by designated Committees.
Furthermore, Reliance is strengthening its continuous controls monitoring capability  across the three lines of defense, enabled by analytics technology, covering all key risk areas.” Enterprise Risk Management 1) Introduction  Reliance actively stimulates entrepreneurship  throughout the organisation and encourages its  people to identify and seize opportunities.
The current  economic environment in combination with significant  growth ambitions of the Reliance Group carries with it  an evolving set of risks.
Reliance recognises that these  risks need to be managed to protect its customers,  employees, shareholders and other stakeholders in the  society to achieve its business objectives and enable  sustainable growth.
Risk and opportunity management  is therefore a key element of the overall Reliance  strategy.
This section provides Reliance’s view on risk  and the key risk factors for Reliance as well as how it  manages risks through its risk management framework.
2) Reliance's View On Risk  2.1) Risk Appetite  Reliance’s risk appetite is linked to its strategic  approach and is based on the stance it has taken  across four areas: • Strategic and Commercial: Reliance manages  strategic risk in the pursuit of profitable growth  in both mature and emerging markets.
Given the  volatile markets and economic climate in which it  operates, the adaptability of its people, its service  offerings and its infrastructure are key.
• Safety and Operations: Reliance is committed to  conduct all its activities in a manner appropriate  to avoid harm to employees and the community.
Reliance strives to deliver safe, reliable and  compliant operations.
• Compliance and Control:  Compliance with laws  and regulations is fundamental to maintaining its  licence to operate in the various industries that it  operates in.
Reliance also believes that accurate  and reliable information provides a competitive  advantage and is key to effective management of  its business.
It therefore accepts minimal risk in  relation to reporting risks.
• Financial:  Reliance manages financial risk to  maintain a prudent financing strategy, even when  undertaking major investments and therefore  taking controlled risks in this area.
In Reliance, risk appetite is formally articulated  through specific policies related to common risks,  business decisions or activities.
For example,  policies such as financing and deal limits, vendor  selection criteria, HSE, customer credit and new  country entry describe the level of risk Reliance  is willing to take including the specific tolerances,  limits and other boundaries within which decisions  shall be taken or activities shall be carried out.
These policies are then enforced through controls  integrated in its business processes and its  governance architecture.
Nikhil R. Meswani Harish Shah  Laxmidas V.   Merchant Risk and Governance 153  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis  2.2) Risk Factors  Reliance emphasises risks that threaten the  achievement of the Group’s business objectives  over the short to medium term.
As part of its annual  planning process, Reliance reviews plan related risks,  opportunities and uncertainties.
It identifies those  as having a high priority for particular oversight  by the Board and its various committees and by  Executive Committees.
An overview of these risks  is provided hereafter, including the actions taken to  mitigate these risks and any related opportunities:   I) Strategic And Commercial Risks    a) Commodity Prices and markets     Reliance’s financial performance is subject  to the fluctuating prices of crude oil and  gas and downstream petroleum products.
Prices of oil and gas products are affected  by supply and demand, both globally  and regionally.
Factors that influence  fluctuations in crude prices and crude  availability include operational issues,  natural disasters, political instability  including geopolitical risks, economic  conditions and Government pricing policy of  petroleum products among others.
Mitigation:  Since Reliance operates an  integrated hydrocarbon business, some  of these risks can be offset by gains in  other parts of the Group.
To mitigate  the risks resulting from non-availability  of crude and feedstock, Reliance has a  diversified crude sourcing strategy from  multiple geographies (Asia, the Middle  East, West Africa, Latin/ South America  and North Africa) under both short-term  and long-term arrangements.
In addition,  Reliance has put in place commodity risk  management policies which provide the  framework for decision-making with  respect to exposures from commodity  trading positions.
Changes since last year:     There have been no significant changes in  the nature of the risk exposures over the  last 12 months.
b) Cyber security risk     As Reliance continues to forge ahead with  digital technology led business process  enablement, it faces an increased exposure  to cyber risks.
A digital security breach or  disruption to digital infrastructure, due to  intentional or unintentional actions, such  as cyber-attacks or human error could  lead to serious business impact.
These  include injury to staff, loss of process  control, impact on business continuity or  damage to assets and services, harm to the  environment, the loss of sensitive data or  information, legal and regulatory breaches  and reputational damage.
Mitigation : Reliance continues to  strengthen its responses to cybersecurity  threats through proactive and reactive  risk mitigations.
These include, proactive  activities to continuously enhance its  cybersecurity policies, standards, technical  safeguards, ongoing monitoring of new  and existing threats and cyber security  awareness initiatives.
Reactive responses  to cybersecurity threats, which include IT  disaster recovery, emergency response  and business continuity management  capabilities, enable the reduction of the  impact of a cybersecurity event.
Changes since last year:     The industry continues to witness a  growth in cybersecurity risks, both in  their prevalence and in their disruptive  potential.
Breakdown of critical information  infrastructure and networks (Critical  information infrastructure breakdown)  has been identified as one of the top cyber  security risks by the World Economic  Forum (WEF) in its latest Global Risk Report  (2018).
It notes that cyber dependency  increases vulnerability to outage of critical  information infrastructure (e.g.
internet,  satellites, etc.)
and networks, causing  widespread disruption.
Large-scale cyber  attacks or ransomware as well as massive  incidents involving data fraud or theft  affecting the organisation or the supply  chain are some of the key cyber security  risks that have the potential to cause  massive economic damages, geopolitical  tensions or widespread loss of trust in the  internet.
Considering the large digital footprint of  Reliance, ongoing efforts are required  154 Reliance Industries Limited  • Making Life Better .
For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice to continuously counter these evolving  threats.
Some of the notable measures are:    1)  A Continuous Improvement Program  (CIP) for cyber security that was  instituted across Reliance, to keep pace  with ever increasing threats, has now  been extended to cover the Critical  Information Infrastructure located at  plant operations.
2)   While Reliance routinely conducts  Cyber Security Awareness programs  and ongoing user awareness connect  activities across the Group, remote  plant locations as well as international  operations have also been brought  under this awareness initiative.
3)  Several businesses of Reliance are now  benchmarked against ISO 27001, the  global standard for ISMS (Information  Security Management System)    4)  Retail business operation’s card  payment transaction processing is  now certified to the global PCI DSS 3.2  (Payment Card Industry Data Security  Standard)   c) Jio Customer Experience and Retention     Reliance Jio has now more than 186  million customers following an innovative  customer acquisition strategy.
Along with  expansion of its current customer base,  customer retention and experience are  of utmost importance for Jio to generate  sustainable business performance and  return on its investments.
Jio is committed  to deliver on a differentiated customer  experience and constant endeavour is to  proactively mitigate any such risks that may  weaken Jio’s value propositions, brand and  customer loyalty.
Mitigation:  T o successfully capitalise  on Pan-India all IP network, backed by  extensive fiber to deliver next generation  digital services and for ensuring sustained  customer value proposition, Jio’s strategic  and risk framework encapsulates the  following mitigations/plans:    1)  Leverage Jio’s Pan-India network  footprint and digital ecosystem to  expand Jio’s product offerings to  diversify revenue sources and   customer base.
2)   Ongoing investments and operational  excellence in the network infrastructure  contributes to delivering on full  population coverage with superior  customer experience.
3)   Jio Prime Membership Programme: A  loyalty programme that not only offers  most competitive monthly tariff plans  in the industry, but also many other  attractive deals and offers from both Jio  and its partners to ensure retention and  loyalty.
4)  Jio pricing and tariff strategy  focuses on continuous innovation on  products/service offerings keeping  various customer segment needs,  requirements and affordability.
The  offerings are always benchmarked with  best value and quality service assurance  vis-à-vis competition.
Changes since last year:     There have been no significant changes in  the nature of the risk exposures over the  last 12 months.
II) Safety and Operational Risks a)  Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) risks in  Operations  Reliance is exposed to a wide spectrum of HSE  risks, given the diversity and complexity of  the industry, it operates in.
The exploration  & production of oil and gas and their further  refining and processing is regulated by various  HSE related regulations across the geographies  where Reliance operates.
A major HSE incident,  such as fire, oil spill, security breach can result  in loss of life, environmental degradation and  overall disruption in business activities.
Mitigation:  The Reliance HSE policy requires  that ‘Safety of persons overrides all production  targets’.
This ensures that all employees strive  for excellence in their own personal safety  and the safety of others including employees,  contractors, customers and the communities  within which Reliance operates.
Furthermore,  Reliance believes that all injuries, occupational  155  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis illnesses as well as safety and environmental  incidents are preventable.
Reliance focusses  on process safety management as a key area  to manage its risks.
A separate Safety and  Operational Risk (S&OR) function which is  independent of the line provides oversight on  safety & operating exposures and periodically  conducts assessments and reviews to provide  independent assurance on the conformance to  the Operating Management System.
Changes since last year:  All entities within the Reliance Group have  progressed risk management through its annual  risk review process which is in place upto facility  level.
This process confirms that controls are  in place and it sets priorities for further risk  reduction or elimination.
Accountabilities for  risk reduction actions are clear and actions  tracked.
A cascaded governance structure is  in place to provide risk oversight.
Additionally,  for the highest risks, action plans have been  defined and endorsed by Executive Management  involving capital investments as well as  enhancing administrative and operational  controls.
Reliance has made good progress in enhancing  conformance to the requirements of its  integrated Operating Management System  (OMS).
The transition to the OMS was prioritised  with a proactive focus on incident prevention.
The focus was on those OMS sub-elements  which have a high impact on process safety,  reliability and control of day-to-day activities  performed by its personnel.
Conformance to  OMS requirements are continuously monitored  through a three lines of defense model.
These  initiatives contribute to safety and operating  excellence delivering HSE Excellence.
b)  Safety and environmental risks during  T ransportation  Technical integrity failure, natural disasters,  extreme weather, human error and other  adverse events or conditions could lead to  loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other  hazardous materials, as well as fires, explosions  or other personal and process safety incidents  during transportation by road, sea or pipeline.
Reliance is exposed to a complex and diverse  range of marine risk including: exploration  vessels, oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas  tankers, dry cargo vessels, operating ethane  vessels, operating chemical tankers, operating  a large fleet of tugs and port service vessels  as well as owning and operating a significant  amount of port and terminal infrastructure.
With  96% of all crude being supplied to Reliance by  vessel and the overwhelming majority of refined  products being exported by vessel it is essential  that these activities are actively managed to  avoid HSE incidents, oil spills or disruption to  business activities and processes.
Mitigation:  An augmented ship vetting  programme has been introduced to ensure  that all vessels contracted to carry Reliance  cargoes undergo an enhanced risk assessment  screening using state-of-the-art predictive  risk software.
For incident response in shipping  formal documentation and cascading has been  completed.
Reliance is further improving the controls  framework for road transportation working  hand in hand with its contractors.
Reliance has  enhanced its capabilities through defensive  driving training, route hazard mapping and real  time tracking.
Contractors are able to use these  in an integrated way to deliver safe operations  while on contract with Reliance.
Changes since last year:  Road transport contractors have been  utilising the services for improving safety in  their operations.
The emergency response  communication facility has been enhanced  through a dedicated emergency response  centre for road transportation in the country so  that contractors can immediately respond to  any emergency.
c)  Physical Security and Natural Calamity risks  Hostile acts such as terrorism or piracy could  harm the Company’s people and disrupt its  operations.
Some of Reliance’s sites are also  subject to natural calamities such as floods,  cyclones, lighting and earthquakes.
If the  Company does not respond, or is perceived  to not respond, in an appropriate manner to  either an external or internal crisis, its business  and operations could be severely disrupted.
Inability to restore or replace critical capacity to  the required level within an agreed timeframe  would prolong the impact of any disruption and  could severely affect Reliance’s business and  operations.
156 Reliance Industries Limited  • Making Life Better .
For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice  Mitigation:  Reliance maintains a proactive  posture by continuously monitoring and  assessing emerging threats, vulnerabilities and  risks to manage its physical security.
Global  Corporate Security (GCS) is a distinct function  of Reliance mandated to de-risk, safeguard and  secure the Company by harnessing expertise  from across the spectrum.
The group security  function and embedded security teams provide  assurance to businesses at all levels with respect  to the management of security risks affecting  its people, assets and operations.
It actively  monitors the threat landscape to   prevent/mitigate risks using a ‘de-risking’  framework, ensuring safe operations and  business continuity.
To respond to natural calamities, Reliance  maintains disaster recovery, crisis and business  continuity management plans to respond to a  disruption or an incident.
Changes since last year:  Despite the prominence and increased  perception of environmental and natural  disasters, cyber and terrorism risks continue  to be increasing globally.
Intelligence based on  detailed analysis of past events and emerging  trends indicate that dealing with these threats is  likely to become more complex in the   inter-connected world.
Continuous application  of pre-emptive mitigation measures is being  ensured to reduce exposure levels.
Reliance is  proactively engaging with as many stakeholders  as possible through external strategic  interventions to mitigate future security risks  to Reliance.
This includes capitalising and  strengthening sustainable relationship with   the government agencies to enhance the  security cover at an enterprise level, especially  against terrorism.
III)  Compliance and Control Risks a)  Regulatory compliance risks  The evolution of the global regulatory  environment and at home the Government of  India’s ambition for reforms and transparency  has resulted into increased regulatory  scrutiny that has raised the bar with regards  to regulatory compliance.
This signifies the  alignment between corporate performance  objectives, while ensuring compliance with  regulatory requirements.
Mitigation:  Reliance recognises that meeting  all applicable regulatory requirements can be  challenging.
A comprehensive and digitally  enabled compliance management framework  has been deployed which is designed to: • Understand changes in regulatory standards  in a timely manner and assess their impact to  strengthen decision-making processes and  integrate these in the business strategy of each  of the industries in which it operates; • Convergence of risk, compliance processes  and controls mechanisms to ensure continued  operational efficiency and effectiveness of  business processes; • Assign single point of accountability for  compliance activities in the organisation.
Changes since last year:    With GST being implemented as a regime  change for the country, the efforts have been  focussed on a seamless migration.
There have  been no significant changes in the nature of  risk exposures related to other regulatory  compliances during the last 12 months.
Automation of a comprehensive compliance  management framework has been key for this  period and has been successfully implemented  across the Group in India, resulting in better  and transparent controls related to regulatory  compliances.
IV) Financial Risks a)  T reasury risks  Treasury risks include, among others, exposure  to movements in interest rates and foreign  exchange rates.
Reliance also maintains  sufficient liquidity, so that it is able to meet its  financial commitments on due dates and is not  forced to obtain funds at higher interest rates.
It has access to markets worldwide and uses a  range of products and currencies to ensure that  its funding is efficient and well diversified across  markets and investor types.
•   Interest Rate risk  Reliance borrows funds from domestic and  international markets to meet its long-term and  short-term funding requirements.
It is subject to  risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates.
Mitigation: The interest rate risk is managed  through financial instruments available to  convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate  157  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis liabilities or vice versa, and is aimed at reducing  the cost of borrowings.
• Foreign Exchange risk  Reliance prepares its financial statements in  Indian Rupee (INR), but most of the payables  and receivables of hydrocarbon business are  in US Dollars, minimising the cash flow risk on  account of fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates.
Reliance avails long-term foreign currency  liabilities (primarily in USD, Euro and JPY) to  fund its capital investments.
Reliance also avails  short-term foreign currency liabilities to fund its  working capital.
Mitigation:  Foreign exchange risk arising from  mismatch of Foreign Currency Assets, Liabilities  and Earnings is tracked and managed within the  risk management framework.
The foreign exchange market is highly regulated  and Reliance ensures compliance with all the  regulations.
Changes since last year:  There have been no significant changes in  the nature of the risk exposures over the last  12 months.
Monitoring mechanisms within  the Treasury function have been enhanced to  further strengthen the control framework.
3) How Reliance Manages Risk  Reliance manages, monitors and reports on the principal  risks and uncertainties that can impact its ability to  achieve its strategic objectives.
The Company’s risk  management framework encompasses internal control  in an integrated manner and is tailored to the specific  Reliance segments, businesses and functions.
It takes  into account various factors such as the size and nature  of the inherent risks and the regulatory environment of  the individual business segment or operating company.
The Reliance management systems, organisational  structures, processes, standards, code of conduct and  values and behaviours together govern how Reliance  conducts its business and manages associated risks.
Reliance’s risk management framework is designed to be  a simple, consistent and clear framework for managing  and reporting risks from the Group’s operations to the  Board.
The framework and related processes seek to  avoid incidents and maximise business outcomes by  allowing management to: • Understand the risk environment and assess the specific  risks and potential exposure for Reliance • Determine how to deal best with these risks to manage  overall potential exposure • Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways • Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness of  the management of these risks and intervene for  improvement where necessary • Report up the management chain to the Board on a  periodic basis about how risks are being managed,  monitored, assured and the improvements that are being  made  3.1) Group Risk Management Framework  The Group Risk Management Framework is designed  to help ensure risk management is an integral part  of the way that Reliance works everywhere to  enable risks to be identified, assessed and managed  appropriately.
The Group Risk Management  Framework comprises three levels: • Oversight and Governance - Reliance’s Board,  along with executive and functional leadership have  articulated an absolute commitment of the Group to  effective risk management and provides oversight to  identify and understand significant risks; both   long-term (such as climate related risks,  opportunities and its financial impacts) and   short-term (such as commodity price risks,  exchange fluctuation risk etc.).
They also put in  place systems of risk management, compliance and  control to mitigate these risks.
Dedicated Executive  sub-committees review and monitor group risks  throughout the year depending on the criticality and  impact with the respective risk owners to drive a risk  management culture.
• Business and Strategic Risk Management - Through  Business Risk and Assurance Committees (BRAC),  Reliance businesses and functions manage risk as  part of key business processes such as    strategy,  planning, operations, performance management,  resource and capital allocation and project appraisal.
The BRAC’s do this by collating risk data, assessing  risk management activities, reviewing near misses  and incidents through root cause analysis followed  by implementation of required improvements.
• Day-to-day Risk Management - Management and  staff at Reliance’s facilities, assets and functions  identify and manage risk, promoting safe, compliant  and reliable operations.
For example, Reliance’s  Group-wide Operating Management System  (OMS) integrates Reliance requirements on health,  safety, security, environment, social responsibility,  operational reliability and related issues.
These  requirements, along with business needs and  158 Reliance Industries Limited  • Making Life Better .
For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice the applicable legal and regulatory requirements,  underpin the practical plans developed to help  reduce risk and deliver strong, sustainable  performance.
3.2)  Continuous Assurance Through the   Three Lines of Defense   Reliance has adopted a Three Lines of Defense  model to enable continuous and real time  assurance on key risk exposures and the  ongoing effectiveness of controls.
First Line of Defense   Business and functional Leaders continuously  verify for themselves that risk management  activities they have in place are effective.
In  conjunction with the risk management activities  themselves, this monitoring activity provides  the first line of defense.
Second Line of Defense   A network of functional experts provides  functional assurance to the businesses in their  area of expertise by:  1)  Providing a view, independent of the line,  of risks within their area of functional  expertise  2)  Setting standards for the management of  risks and provide guidance on mitigations  to relevant businesses in their area of  expertise  3)  Monitoring or verifying the effectiveness  of controls and other risk management  activities completed by the business    Third Line of Defense - Group Audit     Reliance has established an independent Group  Audit function, reporting to the Chairman of  the Board and the Audit Committee.
The Group  Audit function is mandated to provide assurance  and advisory support on the management  systems that manage the key group risks across  all subsidiaries and investments by the Reliance  Group.
Group Audit function is aligned to the  key business segments in order to deliver Group  Wide assurance coverage as part of the third line  of defense.
The Group Audit function has been set up as a  multi-disciplinary teams that deliver assurance  across all areas of risk including strategic &  commercial, safety & operational, compliance  & control and financial risks across all business  segments.
Specialised resources, real time  assurance technologies, data mining, analytic  techniques and external benchmarking of  best practices are leveraged extensively to  achieve Group-wide assurance coverage and  deliver audits in an efficient and effective  manner.
The Group Audit function operates in  line with international auditing standards and  continuously improves its functional capabilities  to achieve world-class assurance best practices.
159  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis Reliance is moving to a digital strategy that leverages  the new digital and cloud capabilities to create new value  propositions for the businesses and markets in which  Reliance operates.
Reliance’s digital strategy aims to reformulate a company’s  value proposition in the markets in which it operates by  integrating a combination of products and digital services  that seek to anticipate and respond to current and future  customer needs.
To consistently deliver new digital  solutions, Reliance is investing in new digital business  capabilities: • A cloud enabled operational IT backbone to drive efficiency  and operational excellence,  • A digital services platform to support business agility and  rapid innovation through new digital products and services.
Reliance has built its operational IT backbone over many  years for all its businesses.
Existing operational IT backbones  provide foundational capabilities that are needed to enable  digital services platforms but have historically been designed  for reliability and efficiency, rather than speed, agile  development and elastic scaling required for rapid digital  innovation.
Reliance is therefore evolving its existing operational IT  backbone with technology and business capabilities to  build and operate digital services platforms which deliver  on its digital strategies, while still ensuring the efficiency,  scalability, reliability, and predictability of Reliance’s core  operations.
Digital services platform enable rapid innovation and agile  change through technology and business capabilities that  facilitate rapid development and implementation of digital  solutions and innovations.
The architecture of a digital  services platform also facilitates experimentation and  reusability of technologies and digital services to improve  operational performance, user experiences and new sources  of value.
The Reliance digital services platforms strategy  includes the rollout of 4 key elements:  1)  Software as a service (SaaS) based platforms - Cloud  based hosting environments for storing and accessing  loosely connected services which deliver business  solutions and services 2)  Enterprise data lake - Integrated repository of massive  amounts of data, whether from internal and public  sources (e.g., from social media), purchased or derived  from sensors (e.g.
IoT) 3)  Analytics and Data Science engines - Computing  capabilities used for converting data into meaningful  insights through data visualization, machine learning and  artificial intelligence   4)  Enterprise Integration capabilities - Scalable  connections to data and processes that reside in the  company’s operational backbones.
The deployment of cloud enabled operational IT backbones  and digital services platforms also require developing and  embedding fundamental management practices related to: • Rapid innovation and agility in identifying emerging trends  and opportunities • Cross-functional development of digital solutions and user- centered product and service design that integrate business  partners (customers, suppliers, other stakeholders) • Agile development and DevSecOps practices and the use  of MVP (minimum viable product) concepts and continuous  improvement capabilities and mindsets • Leveraging business insights from big data repositories of   structured and unstructured data • Reusing and redeploying plug-and-play technologies and  business skills and capabilities   Moving to digital services platform strategy is therefore  a strategic investment in building integrated, difficult-to- replicate capabilities that deliver and sustain Reliance’s long  term strategy in a digital future.

Reliance Foundation directly engages with the communities  through a team of trained professionals.
It collaborates with  the communities right from understanding their needs,  planning and implementing the programmes, and measuring  the values and impact it has created.
In the process,  Reliance engages the community members in planning and  implementation, empowers them through trainings and  works towards scalability and sustainability of the initiatives.
Reliance Foundation forms strategic partnerships with  organisations to bring in synergy to its development  initiatives.
These partnerships include state and local  governments and non-government organisations working  at the grassroots level.
Reliance collaborates with the  organisations for sharing technical know-how, human  resources and infrastructure.
These partnerships support  in delivering Reliance’s commitment by intensively engaging  with the communities and penetrate into the critical issues  that are physically untouched through direct interventions.
Reliance leverages technologies to provide sustainable  solutions.
These technological interventions connect  communities on multiple digital platforms for optimum  use of resources, informed decision making and capacity  building.
This has been greatly aided by the emergence of Jio  Infocomm as a major player in digital services in recent years.
Through the use of technology, Reliance has made significant  progress in reaching out to the people with various products  and services such as information advisories, digital  classrooms, virtual sports clinics, record keeping of patients  among others.
In addition to Reliance Foundation’s interventions, the  Company also encourages its employees to voluntarily  contribute to social causes.
Periodic inputs are obtained  from employees on their interest to contribute to a  particular cause.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice 1) Rural Transformation   Reliance has been addressing the challenges of  rural communities through its rural transformation  programme.
Key initiatives in this programme include  building rural institutions, making villages water secure,  mentoring producer companies and enabling alternative  livelihood options on and off the farm.
The programme  also uses technology based solutions for securing  livelihoods of farmers, fisher folk and livestock owners  across the country.
In addition to direct engagement, Reliance supported  several organisations working in the field of rural  development with an aim to benefit the rural community.
This year, the initiatives supported are aimed at building  drought-resilient villages by ensuring water sufficiency,  income enhancement through women-led cooperative  societies and fishermen producer companies, and  capacity building of farmers for better price realisation.
Together, these initiatives help achieve the SDGs 1 (No  Poverty), 2 (No Hunger), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)  and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).
1.1)  Institution Building    The programme empowers rural communities to  organise themselves into Village Associations,  Producer Companies and Women Thrift Groups.
These community level institutions have facilitated  the development of village level leadership for  addressing local social development issues.
Many of  these institutions have taken up advocacy roles at  different levels.
For long-term sustainability of these institutions,  the members have come together to contribute  towards creating a community owned fund, infuse  equity into producer companies, savings and thrift  activities.
They have also been instrumental in  mobilising physical and financial resources in times  of crisis.
Some of these leaders are also elected by  people as representatives of Gram Panchayats,  given their active participation in community  development initiatives.
T oday, over 86,000 rural  households in 1,100 villages from 32 districts  across 12 states in India are associated with the  programme.
1.2)  Water Security    The programme aims to provide water security to  villages for irrigation and domestic use.
Reliance  works for conserving every drop of rain within the  village.
More than 73 billion litres of water harvesting  capacity has been created since inception by  constructing or renovating water harvesting  structures, including earthen/masonry dams and  check dams, farm ponds, open wells, etc).
Owing to  this effort, over 32,000 hectares received assured  irrigation for two cropping seasons, despite the rain  deficit in many parts of India this year.
These efforts  resulted in water security of 307 villages.
Moreover,  several villages have reported an increase in ground  water level by over 2 metres, even at the peak of  summer seasons.
For efficient water management, user groups were  formed across 260 villages that manage and regulate  sustainable water use.
Assessments show that  the intervention has positively impacted farmer  livelihood in terms of land use pattern, cropping  intensity and income levels.
Reliance supported Paani Foundation’s Water  Cup initiative to ensure water security in rural  Maharashtra.
Through this initiative, over 96 billion  litres of water storage capacity has been created  across 1,300+ villages.
Village Transformation by a Woman Leader Smt.
Lachchho Bai Dehriya  (age 62) is a housewife hailing  from Chikhla village of Seoni  district, Madhya Pradesh.
Her life was distressed  when her husband was  struck by paralysis.
With a  limited farm income from  just 2  hectares of land,  she managed to raise her  children and married off two  daughters.
During all these  years, she felt the need for  environmental conservation  and had a vision for  holistic  development of her village  and the need for women to  contribute to this.
After she joined the  rural transformation  programme in 2012, she  received support in land  development, besides  benefitting from trainings  and exposure visits to  widely acknowledged model  villages of Maharashtra.
All these inspired her to  contribute to the village and  women around her.
Equipped with her enhanced  leadership skills, Lachchho  Bai led a thrift group of 30  women to win freedom from  exploitative money-lenders.
Besides agriculture, she  focussed on pressing social  issues such as alcoholism.
Along with 55 women, she  fought for banning liquor and  tobacco shops, after which  the Gram Sabha submitted  a resolution to the local  police.
The Police Station  of Kurai block awarded her  for this initiative.
Under her  leadership, the village has  made substantial progress  including formation of  seed bank, construction of  toilets, availability of piped  water supply, and enhanced  incomes.
169  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Report on Corporate Social Responsibility Transforming Lives: Water Conservation in  Sendhwa In Bijapuri village of  Sendhwa block (Barwani,  Madhya Pradesh), people  tend to migrate annually  to neighbouring states  including Maharashtra and  Gujarat.
With predominant  rain-fed agriculture and lack  of irrigation, the farmers  were unable to cultivate  more than a single crop that  resulted in dependency  on non-farm livelihood  options during Rabi and Zaid  seasons.
A water-budgeting exercise  carried out revealed that  the village could be made  water secure by harvesting  rainwater at strategic  spots.
After technical  assessment, Reliance  constructed a check dam  that helped assure irrigation  of 80 hectares.
With this  support, the farmers can  now cultivate in at least  two cropping seasons   annually.
This has resulted  in year-round availability of  livelihood options within   the villages.
This aggregation also enhances the bargaining  power of farmers.
So far, Reliance has mentored 19  FPCs, spanning 10 states.
As on 31 st March 2018, the  RF-mentored FPCs had 21,500 farmers associated  with them.
During FY 2017-18, the annual turnover of  FPCs was `67 .5 crore.
Each farmer who transacted  through FPCs, on an average had an additional  income of `5,000 to `6,000.
1.3)  Farmer Producer Companies    Perennially, India’s farmers have faced the challenge  of establishing market linkages.
To help the farmers  overcome this challenge, Reliance empowers them  to set up Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs).
These farmer-owned and farmer-driven companies  sensitise rural producers on the need to come  together as collectives, aggregate farm produce  to bring in economies of scale for fetching better  prices, have sustainable access to markets, etc.
Value Creation through Enhanced Water  Security The focus areas of Rural  Transformation programme  include enhancement of  water security and creating  livelihood opportunities  for small and marginal  farmers.
During 2018,  Reliance initiated an  impact assessment of  its water security and  livelihood interventions  using the Social Returns  on Investment (SRoI)  methodology.
For this assessment, five  programme villages of Agar  (Madhya Pradesh) were  selected.
In these villages,  the water and livelihood  interventions reach out to  around 5,100 people.
By  the end of March 2018, the  programme in Agar has  completed almost five years  of operations.
The study looks at indicators  such as improvement in  water efficiency, economic  stability, education and  health, livelihoods, reduction  in migration, increase in  confidence, aspirations  and self-worth.
Findings  show that the investments  made by Reliance have had a  positive impact on most of  these aspects.
Highlights of Reliance mentored Farmer  Producer Companies for the year • RF received Krishi  Pragati Award 2017 from  NCDEX for outstanding  contribution in improving  income of small and  marginal farmers through  FPCs.
• Bhimpahad Krushak  Producer Company in  Balangir , Odisha was  licensed as a supplier of  seeds and fertilizers by  the Govt.
of Odisha.
This  would benefit the farmer  members in getting quality  seeds at nominal subsidized  government prices.
The  FPC has been ranked as  Grade “ A ” organisation by  NABARD.
• Jamwa Ramgarh FPC  was recognized as the  Most Promising Producer  Company.
• In collaboration with  Gujarat State Co-Operative  Cotton Federation Limited,  Jasdan Producer Company  transacted 54,000+  quintals of groundnut that  benefitted 5,700 farmers.

Corporate Overview  Management Review 41-179 Governance Financial Statements Notice  1.4)  Nutrition Security    T o improve nutritional outcomes among rural  population, Reliance has been promoting its unique  kitchen garden model across its programme  locations as well as providing technical support  to government.
This year, Reliance Foundation  extended the scope of its partnership under  Rajmata Jijau Nutrition Mission of Government of  Maharashtra.
Under this, RF would provide technical  support to anganwadis across 16 districts in setting  up Reliance Nutrition Gardens.
This initiative is  aimed at improving nutritional outcomes of 0.2  million mothers and children in these districts thus  reducing the burden of malnutrition in the state.
1.5)   Alternative Rural Livelihoods and  Entrepreneurship    Reliance promotes alternative livelihood options  to provide protection against uncertainties and  catastrophes that affect farm-based livelihoods.
The Company encourages small farmers to initiate  goat-rearing, poultry, nursery raising and   vermi-composting, among others.
Till date, ~9,500  rural families have benefitted from alternative  livelihoods (over 7 ,000 families during FY 2017-18).
1.6)  Ecological Security    Reliance promotes ecological security in three ways:  increasing the supply of cultivable land; enhancing  the green cover through large-scale plantation  activity; and improving soil health.
The Company adopts eco-consistent soil  conservation methods that resulted in bringing  an additional 7 ,000 hectares (64,000 hectares  since inception) under sustainable agricultural  practices.
This has led to an improvement in soil  texture, structure, microbial activity and aeration,  and almost 80% of this land has been used for food  production.
T o promote biodiversity, over 7 million saplings  were planted during FY 2017-18 (over 20 million  saplings planted since inception).
Reliance observed  the World Environment Day and motivated rural  communities and employees to plant saplings.
The  event saw an enthusiastic participation of 20,000+  people from over 150 villages across 12 states.
Reliance endorses the protection of the soil eco- system.
It conducted over 11,000 soil health tests  and accordingly disseminated relevant advisories.
Virtual platforms for informed decision- making Reliance Foundation has  been using multiple digital  solutions tailored to the  needs of its beneficiaries.
This year, RF leveraged  Jio Infocomm’s “ JioChat”  application and added  essential features in it  to provide solutions to a  range of rural users seeking  customised information and  advice on improving their  lives and livelihood.
The app  allows users to send and  receive information in the  form of text, images, voice  and video.
In addition, the users can  also seek information  with the help of key words  through chat.
So far, 15,000  different advisories have  been uploaded in 9 different  languages.
The content  disseminated through the  app is benefitting a large  population which seeks  information to make the  best decisions about their  livelihoods.
1.7)   Information Services     Reliance, through its information services  programme, empowers communities by providing  reliable information, tailored to the needs of  farmers, fisherfolk, livestock owners, etc.
in more  than 13,000 villages across 12 states.
This is  disseminated both digitally and through community  level interventions that include information on  crop management, livestock care, schemes and  subsidies, healthcare, civic services etc.
The mobile- based advisories have reached an additional 1.2  million individuals this year.
Overall, these advisories  have reached out to 4.8 million individuals since  inception; thus emerging as a powerful tool of  knowledge dissemination.
As part of the programme, Reliance has created  an ecosystem that comprises of more than 1,000  knowledge and infrastructure partners, thematic  experts, including research institutions, government  departments, NGOs, etc.
1.8 )  Improving Access to Social Infrastructure    Reliance improved access to social infrastructure  through development of concrete roads connecting  32 villages in Uttar Pradesh.
The development of  roads is a turning point for many of these villages as  it has improved access to local markets, schools and  healthcare facilities.

Integrated Reporting RIL has been at the forefront of adopting an integrated  thinking in the Company’s management approach.
This  approach reflects in the Company’s business model which  stands on the foundation of value creation for all stakeholder  groups.
While the model is designed to deliver superior  financial performance, it also ensures that in the process,  there is significant amount of value addition across the  organisation’s value chain and its related stakeholder groups.
RIL is a firm believer that the success of a business is not  merely defined by the financial performance of the Company  but also on how well it is able to meet its ambitions while  maintaining the balance of the natural ecosystem and meeting  the expectations of the people who are associated with it.
Ensuring long-term societal value creation and propagating  technological advancement are equally critical factors for  the Company’s long-term sustainability.
For years, RIL has  been living this philosophy and has based its business and  investment decisions on this integrated approach.
Taking one step further in this direction, RIL published its  maiden Integrated Annual Report in the FY 2016-17 aligned  with the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (IIRC)  <IR> framework.
The journey has been continued this year  as well with renewed vigor and focus.
The concept of the six  capitals of business as suggested by the <IR> framework has  been ingrained into the Company’s management philosophy  and has become an important enabler for RIL ’s value creation  story.
This integrated annual report builds on this story to  showcase the Company’s contribution towards each of the  six capitals  viz.
: 1.
Natural Capital:   RIL has been focusing on the five primary areas of  environmental preservation, viz.
clean air, clean water,  preventing soil contamination, preserving flora and fauna  and diligent use of scarce resources.
The Company’s  intent to maximise positive impacts across these five  dimensions are evident in its attempts to move towards  a low-carbon energy mix and enhancing waste material  and water recycling across its operations.
Several steps  have also been taken to propagate a rich biodiversity  in the areas of its operations.
Management of residual  impacts is being handled by implementing best available  technologies which are more efficient and also through  significant investments in pollution control equipment.

Oil and Gas (Exploration & Production) Business FY 2017-18, revenues increased by 0.3% to ` 5,204 crore.
This  marginal change was on account of better price realisations  and ramp up of production in CBM which were partly offset by  decline in production in KG D6 and Shale Gas.

This	responsibility	also	includes	maintenance	of	 adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for  preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and  the	design,	implementation	and	maintenance	of	adequate	internal	 financial	control	that	were	operating	effectively	for	ensuring	the	 accuracy	and	completeness	of	the	accounting	records,	relevant	 to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial  Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from  material	misstatement,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.

093649 Mumbai  Date:	April	27,	2018 279  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Annexure 2  T o the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of  Reliance	Industries	Limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i)  of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,  2013 (“the Act”) We	have	audited	the	internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	 of	Reliance	Industries	Limited	(“the	Company”)	as	of	March 31, 2018	in	 conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  Company	for	the	year	ended	on	that	date.
Management’ s Responsibility for Internal Financial  Controls The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and  maintaining	internal	financial	controls	based	on	the	internal	control	over	 financial	reporting	criteria	established	by	the	Company	considering	the	 essential	components	of	internal	control	stated	in	the	Guidance	Note	on	 Audit	of	Internal	Financial	Controls	Over	Financial	Reporting	issued	by	 the	Institute	of	Chartered	Accountants	of	India.
These	responsibilities	 include	the	design,	implementation	and	maintenance	of	adequate	 internal	financial	controls	that	were	operating	effectively	for	ensuring	 the	orderly	and	efficient	conduct	of	its	business,	including	adherence	to	 the	Company’s	policies,	the	safeguarding	of	its	assets,	the	prevention	 and	detection	of	frauds	and	errors,	the	accuracy	and	completeness	of	 the	accounting	records,	and	the	timely	preparation	of	reliable	financial	 information,	as	required	under	the	Companies	Act,	2013.
Auditor’ s Responsibility Our	responsibility	is	to	express	an	opinion	on	the	Company’s	internal	 financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	based	on	our	audit.
We	 conducted	our	audit	in	accordance	with	the	Guidance	Note	on	Audit	 of	Internal	Financial	Controls	Over	Financial	Reporting	(the	“Guidance	 Note”)	and	the	Standards	on	Auditing	as	specified	under	section	143(10)	 of	the	Companies	Act,	2013,	to	the	extent	applicable	to	an	audit	of	 internal	financial	controls	and	both	issued	by	the	Institute	of	Chartered	 Accountants	of	India.
Those	Standards	and	the	Guidance	Note	require	 that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to	obtain	reasonable	assurance	about	whether	adequate	internal	financial	 controls	over	financial	reporting	was	established	and	maintained	and	if	 such	controls	operated	effectively	in	all	material	respects.
Our	audit	involves	performing	procedures	to	obtain	audit	evidence	about	 the	adequacy	of	the	internal	financial	controls	system	over	financial	 reporting	and	their	operating	effectiveness.
Our	audit	of	internal	financial	 controls	over	financial	reporting	included	obtaining	an	understanding	of	 internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting,	assessing	the	risk	that	 a	material	weakness	exists,	and	testing	and	evaluating	the	design	and	 operating	effectiveness	of	internal	control	based	on	the	assessed	risk.
The	procedures	selected	depend	on	the	auditor’s	judgement,	including	 the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial  Statements,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.
We	believe	that	the	audit	evidence	we	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	 appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal  financial	controls	system	over	financial	reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting A	Company’s	internal	financial	control	over	financial	reporting	is	a	process	 designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial	reporting	and	the	preparation	of	Financial	Statements	for	 external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles.
A	Company’s	internal	financial	control	over	financial	 reporting	includes	those	policies	and	procedures	that	(1)	pertain	to	the	 maintenance	of	records	that,	in	reasonable	detail,	accurately	and	fairly	 reflect	the	transactions	and	dispositions	of	the	assets	of	the	Company;	 (2)	provide	reasonable	assurance	that	transactions	are	recorded	as	 necessary to permit preparation of Financial Statements in accordance  with	generally	accepted	accounting	principles,	and	that	receipts	and	 expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with  authorisations	of	management	and	directors	of	the	Company;	and	(3)	 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of	unauthorised	acquisition,	use,	or	disposition	of	the	Company’s	assets	 that	could	have	a	material	effect	on	the	Financial	Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting Because	of	the	inherent	limitations	of	internal	financial	controls	over	 financial	reporting,	including	the	possibility	of	collusion	or	improper	 management	override	of	controls,	material	misstatements	due	to	error	or	 fraud	may	occur	and	not	be	detected.
Also,	projections	of	any	evaluation	 of	the	internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	to	future	periods	 are	subject	to	the	risk	that	the	internal	financial	control	over	financial	 reporting	may	become	inadequate	because	of	changes	in	conditions,	 or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.
Opinion In	our	opinion,	to	the	best	of	our	information	and	according	to	the	 explanations	given	to	us,	the	Company	has,	in	all	material	respects,	an	 adequate	internal	financial	controls	system	over	financial	reporting	and	 such	internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	were	operating	 effectively	as	at	March 31, 2018,	based	on	the	internal	control	over	 financial	reporting	criteria	established	by	the	Company	considering	the	 essential	components	of	internal	control	stated	in	the	Guidance	Note	on	 Audit	of	Internal	Financial	Controls	Over	Financial	Reporting	issued	by	the	 Institute	of	Chartered	Accountants	of	India.

Significant Accounting Policies  B.1 Basis of Preparation and Presentation    The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for following assets and liabilities which  have	been	measured	at	fair	value	amount: 	 	 i)	 	Certain	Financial	Assets	and	Liabilities	(including	derivative	instruments),	 	 	 ii)	 Defined	Benefit	Plans	-	Plan	Assets	and 	 	 iii)	 Equity	settled	Share	Based	Payments 	 	 	The	Financial	Statements	of	the	Company	have	been	prepared	to	comply	with	the	Indian	Accounting	standards	(‘Ind	AS’),	 including	the	rules	notified	under	the	relevant	provisions	of	the	Companies	Act,	2013.
Company’s	Financial	Statements	are	presented	in	Indian	Rupees	(`),	which	is	also	its	functional	currency	and	all	values	are	 rounded	to	the	nearest	crore	(`	00,00,000),	except	when	otherwise	indicated.
B.2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   (a) Property, Plant and Equipment 	 	 	 	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	are	stated	at	cost,	net	of	recoverable	taxes,	trade	discount	and	rebates	less	 accumulated	depreciation	and	impairment	losses,	if	any.
Such	cost	includes	purchase	price,	borrowing	cost	and	any	 cost	directly	attributable	to	bringing	the	assets	to	its	working	condition	for	its	intended	use,	net	charges	on	foreign	 exchange	contracts	and	adjustments	arising	from	exchange	rate	variations	attributable	to	the	assets.
In	case	of	land	 the	Company	has	availed	fair	value	as	deemed	cost	on	the	date	of	transition	to	Ind	AS.
Subsequent	costs	are	included	 in	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	or	recognised	as	a	separate	asset,	as	appropriate,	only	when	it	is	probable	that	future	 economic	benefits	associated	with	the	item	will	flow	to	the	entity	and	the	cost	can	be	measured	reliably.
Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	which	are	significant	to	the	total	cost	of	that	item	of	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	 and	having	different	useful	life	are	accounted	separately.
Other	Indirect	Expenses	incurred	relating	to	project,	net	of	income	earned	during	the	project	development	stage	 prior	to	its	intended	use,	are	considered	as	pre	-	operative	expenses	and	disclosed	under	Capital	Work	-	in	-	Progress.
Depreciation	on	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	is	provided	using	written	down	value	method	on	depreciable	amount	 except	in	case	of	certain	assets	from	Refining	segment	and	Petrochemical	segment	&	SEZ	units	/	developer	which	 are	depreciated	using	straight	line	method.
Depreciation	is	provided	based	on	useful	life	of	the	assets	as	prescribed	 in	Schedule	II	to	the	Companies	Act,	2013	except	in	respect	of	the	following	assets,	where	useful	life	is	different	than	 those prescribed in Schedule II; Particular Depreciation  Fixed	Bed	Catalyst	(useful	life:	2	years	or	more) Over	its	useful	life	as	technically	assessed	 Fixed	Bed	Catalyst	(useful	life:	up	to	2	years) 100%	depreciated	in	the	year	of	addition Premium	on	Leasehold	Land Over	the	period	of	lease	term 	 	 	 	The	residual	values,	useful	lives	and	methods	of	depreciation	of	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	are	reviewed	at	each	 financial	year	end	and	adjusted	prospectively,	if	appropriate.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 287  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Standalone Financial Statements 	 	 	 	Gains	or	losses	arising	from	derecognition	of	a	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	are	measured	as	the	difference	 between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of  Profit	and	Loss	when	the	asset	is	derecognised.
(b) Leases 	 	 	 	Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	lease,	transfers	substantially	all	the	risks	and	 rewards	of	ownership	to	the	lessee.
All	other	leases	are	classified	as	operating	lease.
Leased Assets:	Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	initially	recognised	as	Assets	of	the	Company	at	their	fair	value	 at	the	inception	of	the	lease	or,	if	lower,	at	the	present	value	of	the	minimum	lease	payments.
The	corresponding	 liability	to	the	lessor	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	as	a	finance	lease	obligation.
Lease	payments	are	apportioned	between	finance	expenses	and	reduction	of	the	lease	obligation	so	as	to	achieve	 a	constant	rate	of	interest	on	the	remaining	balance	of	the	liability.
Finance	expenses	are	recognised	immediately	 in	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	unless	they	are	directly	attributable	to	qualifying	assets,	in	which	case	they	are	 capitalized.
Contingent	rentals	are	recognised	as	expenses	in	the	periods	in	which	they	are	incurred.
A	leased	asset	is	depreciated	over	the	useful	life	of	the	asset	ranging	from	18	years	to	99	years.
However,	if	there	is	no	 reasonable	certainty	that	the	Company	will	obtain	ownership	by	the	end	of	the	lease	term,	the	asset	is	depreciated	 over	the	shorter	of	the	estimated	useful	life	of	the	asset	and	the	lease	term.
Operating	lease	payments	are	recognised	as	an	expense	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	on	a	straight-line	basis	 over the lease term except where another systematic basis is more representative of time pattern in which economic  benefits	from	the	leased	assets	are	consumed.
(c) Intangible Assets 	 	 	 	Intangible	Assets	are	stated	at	cost	of	acquisition	net	of	recoverable	taxes,	trade	discount	and	rebates	less	accumulated	 amortisation	/	depletion	and	impairment	losses,	if	any.
Such	cost	includes	purchase	price,	borrowing	costs,	and	any	cost	 directly	attributable	to	bringing	the	asset	to	its	working	condition	for	the	intended	use,	net	charges	on	foreign	exchange	 contracts	and	adjustments	arising	from	exchange	rate	variations	attributable	to	the	Intangible	Assets.
Subsequent	costs	are	included	in	the	asset’s	carrying	amount	or	recognised	as	a	separate	asset,	as	appropriate,	only	 when	it	is	probable	that	future	economic	benefits	associated	with	the	item	will	flow	to	the	entity	and	the	cost	can	be	 measured	reliably.
Other	Indirect	Expenses	incurred	relating	to	project,	net	of	income	earned	during	the	project	development	  stage	prior	to	its	intended	use,	are	considered	as	pre	-	operative	expenses	and	disclosed	under	Intangible	Assets	 Under	Development.
Gains	or	losses	arising	from	derecognition	of	an	Intangible	Asset	are	measured	as	the	difference	between	the	net	 disposal	proceeds	and	the	carrying	amount	of	the	asset	and	are	recognised	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	when	 the	asset	is	derecognised.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 288 Reliance Industries Limited  • Making Life Better .
For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice 	 	 	 	A	summary	of	amortisation	/	depletion	policies	applied	to	the	Company’s	Intangible	Assets	to	the	extent	of	 depreciable	amount	is	as	follows: Particular Depreciation  T echnical Know-How Over	the	useful	life	of	the	underlying	assets	ranging	from	5	years	to	35	years.
Computer Software Over	a	period	of	5	years.
Development Rights Depleted	using	the	unit	of	production	method.
The	cost	of	producing	wells	along	with	its	 related facilities including decommissioning costs are depleted in proportion of oil and gas  production	achieved	vis-à-vis	Proved	Developed	Reserves.
The	cost	for	common	facilities	 including	its	decommissioning	costs	are	depleted	using	Proved	Reserves.
Others In	case	of	Jetty,	the	aggregate	amount	amortised	to	date	is	not	less	than	the	aggregate	 rebate	availed	by	the	Company.
The	amortisation	period	and	the	amortisation	method	for	Intangible	Assets	with	a	finite	useful	life	are	reviewed	at	 each	reporting	date.
(d) Research and Development Expenditure 	 	 	 	Revenue	expenditure	pertaining	to	research	is	charged	to	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
Development	costs	of	 products	are	charged	to	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	unless	a	product’s	technological	and	commercial	feasibility	 has	been	established,	in	which	case	such	expenditure	is	capitalised.
(e) Finance Cost 	 	 	 	Borrowing	costs	include	exchange	differences	arising	from	foreign	currency	borrowings	to	the	extent	they	are	 regarded	as	an	adjustment	to	the	interest	cost.
Borrowing	costs	that	are	directly	attributable	to	the	acquisition	or	 construction	of	qualifying	assets	are	capitalised	as	part	of	the	cost	of	such	assets.
A	qualifying	asset	is	one	that	 necessarily	takes	substantial	period	of	time	to	get	ready	for	its	intended	use.
Interest	income	earned	on	the	temporary	investment	of	specific	borrowings	pending	their	expenditure	on	qualifying	 assets	is	deducted	from	the	borrowing	costs	eligible	for	capitalisation.
All	other	borrowing	costs	are	charged	to	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	for	the	period	for	which	they	are	incurred.
(f ) Inventories 	 	 	 	Items	of	inventories	are	measured	at	lower	of	cost	and	net	realisable	value	after	providing	for	obsolescence,	if	any,	 except	in	case	of	by-products	which	are	valued	at	net	realisable	value.
Cost	of	inventories	comprises	of	cost	of	 purchase,	cost	of	conversion	and	other	costs	including	manufacturing	overheads	net	of	recoverable	taxes	incurred	in	 bringing	them	to	their	respective	present	location	and	condition.
Cost	of	raw	materials,	chemicals,	stores	and	spares,	packing	materials,	trading	and	other	products	are	determined	on	 weighted	average	basis.
(g)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets 	 	 	 	The	Company	assesses	at	each	reporting	date	as	to	whether	there	is	any	indication	that	any	Property,	Plant	and	 Equipment	and	Intangible	Assets	or	group	of	Assets,	called	Cash	Generating	Units	(CGU)	may	be	impaired.
If	any	such	 indication	exists,	the	recoverable	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	is	estimated	to	determine	the	extent	of	impairment,	if	 any.
When	it	is	not	possible	to	estimate	the	recoverable	amount	of	an	individual	asset,	the	Company	estimates	the	 recoverable	amount	of	the	CGU	to	which	the	asset	belongs.
An	impairment	loss	is	recognised	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	to	the	extent,	asset’s	carrying	amount	exceeds	 its	recoverable	amount.
The	recoverable	amount	is	higher	of	an	asset’s	fair	value	less	cost	of	disposal	and	value	 in	use.
Value	in	use	is	based	on	the	estimated	future	cash	flows,	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	pre-tax	 discount	rate	that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	risk	specific	to	the	assets.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 289  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Standalone Financial Statements     The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of  recoverable	amount.
(h) Provisions 	 	 	 	Provisions	are	recognised	when	the	Company	has	a	present	obligation	(legal	or	constructive)	as	a	result	of	a	past	 event,	it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	of	resources	embodying	economic	benefits	will	be	required	to	settle	the	 obligation	and	a	reliable	estimate	can	be	made	of	the	amount	of	the	obligation.
If	the	effect	of	the	time	value	of	money	is	material,	provisions	are	discounted	using	a	current	pre-tax	rate	that	 reflects,	when	appropriate,	the	risks	specific	to	the	liability.
When	discounting	is	used,	the	increase	in	the	provision	 due	to	the	passage	of	time	is	recognised	as	a	finance	cost.
Provision for Decommissioning	Liability 	 	 	 	The	Company	records	a	provision	for	decommissioning	costs	towards	site	restoration	activity.
Decommissioning	 costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to  fulfil	decommissioning	obligations	and	are	recognized	as	part	of	the	cost	of	the	underlying	assets.
Any	change	in	the	 present	value	of	the	expenditure,	other	than	unwinding	of	discount	on	the	provision,	is	reflected	as	adjustment	to	the	 provision	and	the	corresponding	asset.
The	change	in	the	provision	due	to	the	unwinding	of	discount	is	recognized	in	 the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
(i) Employee Benefits Expense    Short T erm Employee Benefits 	 	 	 	The	undiscounted	amount	of	short	term	employee	benefits	expected	to	be	paid	in	exchange	for	the	services	 rendered	by	employees	are	recognised	as	an	expense	during	the	period	when	the	employees	render	the	services.
Post-Employment Benefits 	 	 	 Defined	Contribution	Plans 	 	 	 	The	Company	recognizes	contribution	payable	to	the	provident	fund	scheme	as	an	expense,	when	an	employee	 renders	the	related	service.
If	the	contribution	payable	to	the	scheme	for	service	received	before	the	balance	 sheet	date	exceeds	the	contribution	already	paid,	the	deficit	payable	to	the	scheme	is	recognized	as	a	liability	after	 deducting	the	contribution	already	paid.
If	the	contribution	already	paid	exceeds	the	contribution	due	for	services	 received	before	the	balance	sheet	date,	then	excess	is	recognized	as	an	asset	to	the	extent	that	the	pre-payment	will	 lead	to,	for	example,	a	reduction	in	future	payment	or	a	cash	refund.
Defined	Benefit	Plans 	 	 	 	The	Company	pays	gratuity	to	the	employees	who	have	completed	five	years	of	service	with	the	Company	at	the	 time	of	resignation/superannuation.
The	gratuity	is	paid	@15	days	salary	for	every	completed	year	of	service	as	per	 the	Payment	of	Gratuity	Act	1972.
The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to  the	employees.
The	gratuity	fund	has	been	approved	by	respective	Income	Tax	authorities.
The	liability	in	respect	of	gratuity	and	other	post-employment	benefits	is	calculated	using	the	Projected	Unit	Credit	 Method	and	spread	over	the	period	during	which	the	benefit	is	expected	to	be	derived	from	employees’	services.
Re-measurement	of	Defined	Benefit	Plans	in	respect	of	post-employment	are	charged	to	the	Other	  Comprehensive	Income.
Employee Separation Costs     Compensation to employees who have opted for retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme of the Company  is	payable	in	the	year	of	exercise	of	option	by	the	employee.
The	Company	recognises	the	employee	separation	cost	 when	the	scheme	is	announced	and	the	Company	is	demonstrably	committed	to	it.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice   (j) T ax Expenses 	 	 	 	The	tax	expense	for	the	period	comprises	of	current	tax	and	deferred	income	tax.
Tax	is	recognised	in	Statement	of	 Profit	and	Loss,	except	to	the	extent	that	it	relates	to	items	recognised	in	the	Other	Comprehensive	Income	or	in	 equity.
In	which	case,	the	tax	is	also	recognised	in	Other	Comprehensive	Income	or	Equity.
i) Current tax      Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the  Income	Tax	authorities,	based	on	tax	rates	and	laws	that	are	enacted	at	the	Balance	sheet	date.
ii) Deferred tax 	 	 	 	 	Deferred	tax	is	recognised	on	temporary	differences	between	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	in	 the	Financial	Statements	and	the	corresponding	tax	bases	used	in	the	computation	of	taxable	profit.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in  which	the	liability	is	settled	or	the	asset	realised,	based	on	tax	rates	(and	tax	laws)	that	have	been	enacted	or	 substantively	enacted	by	the	end	of	the	reporting	period.
The	carrying	amount	of	Deferred	tax	liabilities	and	 assets	are	reviewed	at	the	end	of	each	reporting	period.
(k) Share Based Payments     Equity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair  value	of	the	equity	instruments	at	the	grant	date.
Details	regarding	the	determination	of	the	fair	value	of	equity- settled	share	based	payments	transactions	are	set	out	in	Note	27.3.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight  line	basis	over	the	vesting	period,	based	on	the	Company`s	estimate	of	equity	instruments	that	will	eventually	vest,	 with	a	corresponding	increase	in	equity.
At	the	end	of	each	reporting	period,	the	Company	revises	its	estimate	of	 the	number	of	equity	instruments	expected	to	vest.
The	impact	of	the	revision	of	the	original	estimates,	if	any,	is	 recognised	in	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	such	that	the	cumulative	expenses	reflects	the	revised	estimate,	with	a	 corresponding	adjustment	to	the	Share	Based	Payments	Reserve.
The	dilutive	effect	of	outstanding	options	is	reflected	as	additional	share	dilution	in	the	computation	of	diluted	 earnings	per	share.
(l)  Foreign Currencies T ransactions and T ranslation 	 	 	 	Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	recorded	at	the	exchange	rate	prevailing	on	the	date	of	transaction.
Monetary	 assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency closing rates of  exchange	at	the	reporting	date.
Exchange	differences	arising	on	settlement	or	translation	of	monetary	items	are	recognised	in	Statement	of	Profit	 and	Loss	except	to	the	extent	of	exchange	differences	which	are	regarded	as	an	adjustment	to	interest	costs	on	 foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets which  are	capitalized	as	cost	of	assets.
Additionally,	exchange	gains	or	losses	on	foreign	currency	borrowings	taken	prior	to	 April	1,	2016	which	are	related	to	the	acquisition	or	construction	of	qualifying	assets	are	adjusted	in	the	carrying	cost	 of	such	assets.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the  exchange	rates	at	the	date	of	the	transaction.
Non-monetary	items	measured	at	fair	value	in	a	foreign	currency	 are	translated	using	the	exchange	rates	at	the	date	when	the	fair	value	was	measured.
The	gain	or	loss	arising	on	 translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on  the	change	in	fair	value	of	the	item	(i.e.,	translation	differences	on	items	whose	fair	value	gain	or	loss	is	recognised	in	 Other	Comprehensive	Income	or	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	are	also	recognised	in	Other	Comprehensive	Income	 or	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	respectively).

Revenue from rendering of services is recognised when the performance of agreed contractual task has been  completed.
Revenue	from	operations	is	measured	at	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	received	or	receivable,	taking	into	account	 contractually	defined	terms	of	payment	and	excluding	taxes	or	duties	collected	on	behalf	of	the	government.

(n) Financial Instruments    i) Financial Assets 	 	 	 	 A.
Initial	Recognition	and	Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	All	Financial	Assets	are	initially	recognized	at	fair	value.
Transaction	costs	that	are	directly	attributable	 to	the	acquisition	or	issue	of	Financial	Assets,	which	are	not	at	Fair	Value	Through	Profit	or	Loss,	are	 adjusted	to	the	fair	value	on	initial	recognition.

B.
Subsequent	measurement 	 	 	 	 	 a)	 	Financial	Assets	measured	at	Amortised	Cost	(AC)        A Financial Asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose  objective	is	to	hold	the	asset	in	order	to	collect	contractual	cash	flows	and	the	contractual	terms	of	 the	Financial	Asset	give	rise	on	specified	dates	to	cash	flows	that	are	solely	payments	of	principal	 and	interest	on	the	principal	amount	outstanding.
b)	 	Financial	Assets	measured	at	Fair	Value	Through	Other	Comprehensive	Income	(FVTOCI) 	 	 	 	 	 	 	A	Financial	Asset	is	measured	at	FVTOCI	if	it	is	held	within	a	business	model	whose	objective	is	 achieved	by	both	collecting	contractual	cash	flows	and	selling	Financial	Assets	and	the	contractual	 terms	of	the	Financial	Asset	give	rise	on	specified	dates	to	cash	flows	that	are	solely	payments	of	 principal	and	interest	on	the	principal	amount	outstanding.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice 	 	 	 	 E.		 Impairment	of	Financial	Assets 	 	 	 	 	 	In	accordance	with	Ind	AS	109,	the	Company	uses	‘Expected	Credit	Loss’	(ECL)	model,	for	evaluating	 impairment	of	Financial	Assets	other	than	those	measured	at	Fair	Value	Through	Profit	and	Loss	 (FVTPL).
Expected	credit	losses	are	measured	through	a	loss	allowance	at	an	amount	equal	to:      •  The	12-months	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	those	default	 events	on	the	financial	instrument	that	are	possible	within	12	months	after	the	reporting	date);	or      •  Full	lifetime	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	all	possible	default	 events	over	the	life	of	the	financial	instrument) 	 	 	 	 	 	For	Trade	Receivables	the	Company	applies	‘simplified	approach’	which	requires	expected	lifetime	losses	 to	be	recognised	from	initial	recognition	of	the	receivables.
The	Company	uses	historical	default	rates	to	 determine	impairment	loss	on	the	portfolio	of	trade	receivables.
At	every	reporting	date	these	historical	 default	rates	are	reviewed	and	changes	in	the	forward	looking	estimates	are	analysed.
For	other	assets,	the	Company	uses	12	month	ECL	to	provide	for	impairment	loss	where	there	is	no	 significant	increase	in	credit	risk.
If	there	is	significant	increase	in	credit	risk	full	lifetime	ECL	is	used.
ii)  Financial Liabilities 	 	 	 	 A.
Initial	Recognition	and	Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	All	Financial	Liabilities	are	recognized	at	fair	value	and	in	case	of	borrowings,	net	of	directly	attributable	 cost.
Fees	of	recurring	nature	are	directly	recognised	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	as	finance	cost.
B.
Subsequent	Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	Financial	Liabilities	are	carried	at	amortized	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method.
For	trade	and	other	payables	maturing	within	one	year	from	the	balance	sheet	date,	the	carrying	 amounts	approximate	fair	value	due	to	the	short	maturity	of	these	instruments.
iii)   Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting 	 	 	 	 	The	Company	uses	various	derivative	financial	instruments	such	as	interest	rate	swaps,	currency	swaps,	 forwards	&	options	and	commodity	contracts	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	changes	in	interest	rates,	exchange	rates	 and	commodity	prices.
Such	derivative	financial	instruments	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	on	the	  date	on	which	a	derivative	contract	is	entered	into	and	are	also	subsequently	measured	at	fair	value.
Derivatives	are	carried	as	Financial	Assets	when	the	fair	value	is	positive	and	as	Financial	Liabilities	when	the	 fair	value	is	negative.
Any	gains	or	losses	arising	from	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	derivatives	are	taken	directly	to	Statement	of	Profit	 and	Loss,	except	for	the	effective	portion	of	cash	flow	hedge	which	is	recognised	in	Other	Comprehensive	 Income	and	later	to	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	when	the	hedged	item	affects	profit	or	loss	or	is	treated	as	 basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a Non-Financial  Assets	or	Non-Financial	liability.
Hedges	that	meet	the	criteria	for	hedge	accounting	are	accounted	for	as	follows: 	 	 	 	 A.
Cash	Flow	Hedge 	 	 	 	 	 	The	Company	designates	derivative	contracts	or	non-derivative	Financial	Assets	/	Liabilities	as	hedging	 instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign  exchange	exposure	on	highly	probable	future	cash	flows	attributable	to	a	recognised	asset	or	liability	 or	forecast	cash	transactions.
When	a	derivative	is	designated	as	a	cash	flow	hedging	instrument,	the	 Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 293  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Standalone Financial Statements effective	portion	of	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	derivative	is	recognized	in	the	cash	flow	hedging	 reserve	being	part	of	Other	Comprehensive	Income.
Any	ineffective	portion	of	changes	in	the	fair	 value	of	the	derivative	is	recognized	immediately	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
If	the	hedging	 relationship	no	longer	meets	the	criteria	for	hedge	accounting,	then	hedge	accounting	is	discontinued	 prospectively.
If	the	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	terminated	or	exercised,	the	cumulative	gain	 or	loss	on	the	hedging	instrument	recognized	in	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	till	the	period	the	hedge	was	 effective	remains	in	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	until	the	underlying	transaction	occurs.
The	cumulative	 gain	or	loss	previously	recognized	in	the	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	is	transferred	to	the	Statement	of	 Profit	and	Loss	upon	the	occurrence	of	the	underlying	transaction.
If	the	forecasted	transaction	is	no	 longer	expected	to	occur,	then	the	amount	accumulated	in	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	is	reclassified	in	 the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
B.
Fair	Value	Hedge 	 	 	 	 	 	The	Company	designates	derivative	contracts	or	non-derivative	Financial	Assets	/	Liabilities	as	hedging	 instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest  rates,	foreign	exchange	rates	and	commodity	prices.
Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair  value	hedges	are	recorded	in	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
If	the	hedging	relationship	no	  longer	meets	the	criteria	for	hedge	accounting,	the	adjustment	to	the	carrying	amount	of	a	hedged	item	 for	which	the	effective	interest	method	is	used	is	amortised	to	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	over	the	 period	of	maturity.
iv)  Derecognition of Financial Instruments 	 	 	 	 	The	Company	derecognizes	a	Financial	Asset	when	the	contractual	rights	to	the	cash	flows	from	the	Financial	 Asset	expire	or	it	transfers	the	Financial	Asset	and	the	transfer	qualifies	for	derecognition	under	Ind	AS	109.
A	 Financial	liability	(or	a	part	of	a	Financial	liability)	is	derecognized	from	the	Company’s	Balance	Sheet	when	the	 obligation	specified	in	the	contract	is	discharged	or	cancelled	or	expires.
v) Offsetting 	 	 	 	 	Financial	Assets	and	Financial	Liabilities	are	offset	and	the	net	amount	is	presented	in	the	balance	sheet	when,	 and	only	when,	the	Company	has	a	legally	enforceable	right	to	set	off	the	amount	and	it	intends,	either	to	settle	 them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously   (o) Accounting For Oil and Gas Activity 	 	 	 	The	Company	has	adopted	Successful	Efforts	Method	(SEM)	of	accounting	for	its	Oil	and	Gas	activities.
The	policy	of	 recognition	of	exploration	and	evaluation	expenditure	is	considered	in	line	with	the	principle	of	SEM.
Seismic	costs,	 geological	and	geophysical	studies,	petroleum	exploration	license	fees	and	general	and	administration	costs	directly	 attributable	to	exploration	and	evaluation	activities	are	expensed	off.
The	costs	incurred	on	acquisition	of	interest	 in	oil	and	gas	blocks	and	on	exploration	and	evaluation	other	than	those	which	are	expensed	off	are	accounted	for	 as	Intangible	Assets	Under	Development.
All	development	costs	incurred	in	respect	of	proved	reserves	are	also	 capitalized	under	Intangible	Assets	Under	Development.
Once	a	well	is	ready	to	commence	commercial	production,	 the	costs	accumulated	in	Intangible	Assets	Under	Development	are	classified	as	Intangible	Assets	corresponding	to	 proved	developed	oil	and	gas	reserves.
The	exploration	and	evaluation	expenditure	which	does	not	result	in	discovery	 of	proved	oil	and	gas	reserves	and	all	cost	pertaining	to	production	are	charged	to	the	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
The Company used technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System   guidelines	2011	and	standard	geological	and	reservoir	engineering	methods.
The	reserve	review	and	evaluation	is	 carried	out	annually.
Oil	and	Gas	Joint	Ventures	are	in	the	nature	of	joint	operations.
Accordingly,	assets	and	liabilities	as	well	as	income	 and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the  Company’s	Financial	Statements,	according	to	the	participating	interest	of	the	Company.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice C.  Critical Accounting Judgments And Key Sources Of Estimation Uncertainty 	 	The	preparation	of	the	Company’s	Financial	Statements	requires	management	to	make	judgement,	estimates	and	assumptions	 that	affect	the	reported	amount	of	revenue,	expenses,	assets	and	liabilities	and	the	accompanying	disclosures.
Uncertainty	about	 these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or  liabilities	affected	in	next	financial	years.
(a) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves 	 	 	The	determination	of	the	Company’s	estimated	oil	and	natural	gas	reserves	requires	significant	judgements	and	estimates	 to	be	applied	and	these	are	regularly	reviewed	and	updated.
Factors	such	as	the	availability	of	geological	and	engineering	 data,	reservoir	performance	data,	acquisition	and	divestment	activity,	drilling	of	new	wells,	and	commodity	prices	all	impact	 on	the	determination	of	the	Company’s	estimates	of	its	oil	and	natural	gas	reserves.
The	Company	bases	it’s	proved	 reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based  on	conventional	industry	practice	and	regulatory	requirements.
Estimates	of	oil	and	natural	gas	reserves	are	used	to	calculate	depletion	charges	for	the	Company’s	oil	and	gas	properties.
The	impact	of	changes	in	estimated	proved	reserves	is	dealt	with	prospectively	by	amortizing	the	remaining	carrying	value	 of	the	asset	over	the	expected	future	production.
Oil	and	natural	gas	reserves	also	have	a	direct	impact	on	the	assessment	 of	the	recoverability	of	asset	carrying	values	reported	in	the	Financial	Statements.
Details	on	proved	reserves	and	production	both	on	product	and	geographical	basis	are	provided	in	Note	32.2.
(b) Decommissioning Liabilities 	 	 	The	liability	for	decommissioning	costs	are	recognized	when	the	Company	has	an	obligation	to	perform	site	restoration	 activity.
The	recognition	and	measurement	of	decommissioning	provisions	involves	the	use	of	estimates	and	assumptions.
These include; the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of  the	field,	expected	utilization	of	assets	by	other	fields,	the	scope	of	abandonment	activity	and	pre-tax	rate	applied	for	 discounting.
(c)  Depreciation / Amortisation and useful lives of Property Plant and Equipment / Intangible Assets 	 	 	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	/	Intangible	Assets	are	depreciated	/	amortised	over	their	estimated	useful	lives,	after	taking	 into	account	estimated	residual	value.
Management	reviews	the	estimated	useful	lives	and	residual	values	of	the	assets	 annually	in	order	to	determine	the	amount	of	depreciation	/	amortisation	to	be	recorded	during	any	reporting	period.
The	 useful lives and residual values are based on the Company’s historical experience with similar assets and take into account  anticipated	technological	changes.
The	depreciation	/	amortisation	for	future	periods	is	revised	if	there	are	significant	 changes	from	previous	estimates.
(d) Recoverability of T rade Receivables    Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision  against	those	receivables	is	required.
Factors	considered	include	the	credit	rating	of	the	counterparty,	the	amount	and	 timing	of	anticipated	future	payments	and	any	possible	actions	that	can	be	taken	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	non-payment.
(e) Provisions 	 	 	Provisions	and	liabilities	are	recognized	in	the	period	when	it	becomes	probable	that	there	will	be	a	future	outflow	of	 funds	resulting	from	past	operations	or	events	and	the	amount	of	cash	outflow	can	be	reliably	estimated.
The	timing	of	 recognition	and	quantification	of	the	liability	requires	the	application	of	judgement	to	existing	facts	and	circumstances,	 which	can	be	subject	to	change.
The	carrying	amounts	of	provisions	and	liabilities	are	reviewed	regularly	and	revised	to	take	 account	of	changing	facts	and	circumstances.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 295  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Standalone Financial Statements  (f ) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 	 	 	The	Company	assesses	at	each	reporting	date	whether	there	is	an	indication	that	an	asset	may	be	impaired.
If	any	 indication	exists,	the	Company	estimates	the	asset’s	recoverable	amount.
An	asset’s	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	 of	an	asset’s	or	Cash	Generating	Units	(CGU’s)	fair	value	less	costs	of	disposal	and	its	value	in	use.
It	is	determined	for	an	 individual	asset,	unless	the	asset	does	not	generate	cash	inflows	that	are	largely	independent	of	those	from	other	assets	or	 a	groups	of	assets.
Where	the	carrying	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	exceeds	its	recoverable	amount,	the	asset	is	considered	 impaired	and	is	written	down	to	its	recoverable	amount.
In	assessing	value	in	use,	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	pre-tax	discount	rate	 that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	the	risks	specific	to	the	asset.
In	determining	fair	 value	less	costs	of	disposal,	recent	market	transactions	are	taken	into	account,	if	no	such	transactions	can	be	identified,	an	 appropriate	valuation	model	is	used.
(g) Impairment of Financial Assets    The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss  rates.
The	Company	uses	judgement	in	making	these	assumptions	and	selecting	the	inputs	to	the	impairment	calculation,	 based	on	Company’s	past	history,	existing	market	conditions	as	well	as	forward	looking	estimates	at	the	end	of	each	 reporting	period.
D.   Standards Issued but not Effective 	 	On	March	28,	2018,	the	Ministry	of	Corporate	Affairs	(MCA)	has	notified	Ind	AS	115	-	Revenue	from	Contract	with	Customers	and	 certain	amendment	to	existing	Ind	AS.
These	amendments	shall	be	applicable	to	the	Company	from	April	01,	2018.
(a)  Issue of Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers 	 	 	Ind	AS	115	will	supersede	the	current	revenue	recognition	guidance	including	Ind	AS	18	Revenue,	Ind	AS	11	Construction	 Contracts	and	the	related	interpretations.
Ind	AS	115	provides	a	single	model	of	accounting	for	revenue	arising	from	 contracts	with	customers	based	on	the	identification	and	satisfaction	of	performance	obligations.
(b)  Amendment to Existing issued Ind AS 	 	 	The	MCA	has	also	carried	out	amendments	of	the	following	accounting	standards: 	 	 i.	 	Ind	AS	21	-	The	Effects	of	Changes	in	Foreign	Exchange	Rates 	 	 ii.

The	above	 information	is	certified	by	the	actuary.
The	Expected	Rate	of	Return	on	Plan	Assets	is	determined	considering	several	applicable	factors,	mainly	the	 composition	of	Plan	Assets	held,	assessed	risks,	historical	results	of	return	on	Plan	Assets	and	the	Company’s	policy	 for	Plan	Assets	Management.
VII)  The	expected	contributions	for	Defined	Benefit	Plan	for	the	next	financial	year	will	be	in	line	with	FY	2017-18.
VIII) Sensitivity Analysis 	 	 	 	Significant	Actuarial	Assumptions	for	the	determination	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	are	discount	trade,	 expected	salary	increase	and	employee	turnover.
The	sensitivity	analysis	below,	have	been	determined	based	on	 reasonably	possible	changes	of	the	assumptions	occurring	at	end	of	the	reporting	period	,	while	holding	all	other	 assumptions	constant.
The	result	of	Sensitivity	analysis	is	given	below: (`	in	crore) Particulars As at 31st March, 2018 As at 31st March, 2017 Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Change	in	discounting	rate	(delta	effect	of	+/-	0.5%) 21 23 19 21 Change	in	rate	of	salary	increase	(delta	effect	of	+/-	0.5%) 22 23 20 21 Change	in	rate	of	employee	turnover	(delta	effect	of	+/-	0.5%) 4 4 2 2  	These	plans	typically	expose	the	Company	to	actuarial	risks	such	as:	Investment	Risk,	Interest	Risk,	  Longevity	Risk	and	Salary	Risk.
Investment  Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	plan	liability	is	calculated	using	a	discount	rate	which	is	 determined	by	reference	to	market	yields	at	the	end	of	the	reporting	period	on	government	bonds.
Interest  Risk A	decrease	in	the	bond	interest	rate	will	increase	the	plan	liability;	however,	this	will	be	partially	offset	 by	an	increase	in	the	return	on	the	plan	debt	investments.
Longevity	 Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	plan	liability	is	calculated	by	reference	to	the	best	estimate	 of	the	mortality	of	plan	participants	both	during	and	after	their	employment.
An	increase	in	the	life	 expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary   Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	plan	liability	is	calculated	by	reference	to	the	future	salaries	of	plan	 participants.
As	such,	an	increase	in	the	salary	of	the	plan	participants	will	increase	the	plan’s	liability.

32.3 	 	Government	of	India	(GOI),	by	its	letters	dated	2nd	May,	2012,	14th	November,	2013,	10th	July,	2014	and	3rd	June	2016	has	 communicated	that	it	proposes	to	disallow	certain	costs	which	the	Production	Sharing	Contract	(PSC),	relating	to	Block	KG- DWN-98/3	entitles	the	Company	to	recover.
Based	on	legal	advice	received,	the	Company	continues	to	maintain	that	a	Contractor	is	 entitled	to	recover	all	of	its	costs	under	the	terms	of	the	PSC	and	there	are	no	provisions	that	entitle	the	Government	to	disallow	the	 recovery	of	any	Contract	Cost	as	defined	in	the	PSC.
The	Company	has	already	referred	the	issue	to	arbitration	and	the	arbitration	is	 currently	underway.
Pending	decision	of	the	arbitration,	the	demand	from	the	GOI	of	$	148	million	being	the	Company’s	Share	(total	 demand	$	247	million)	towards	additional	Profit	Petroleum	has	been	considered	as	contingent	liability.
32.4 	 (a)	 	The	Government	has	made	a	claim	of	about	$	1.55	billion	against	the	KGD6	Contractor	parties	in	respect	of	gas	said	to	have	 migrated	from	neighbouring	blocks.
In	carrying	out	petroleum	operations,	the	Contractor	has	worked	within	the	boundaries	 of	the	block	awarded	to	it	and	has	complied	with	all	applicable	regulations	and	provisions	of	the	PSC.
The	Company	has	 already	invoked	the	dispute	resolution	mechanism	in	the	PSC	and	issued	a	Notice	of	Arbitration	to	the	Government	on	 11th	November,	2016.
The	Company	remains	convinced	of	being	able	to	fully	justify	and	vindicate	its	position	that	the	 Government’s	claim	is	not	sustainable.
The	arbitration	hearings	are	over	and	the	arbitral	award	is	awaited.
(b)	 	In	supersession	of	the	Ministry’s	Gazette	notification	no.
22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V.
dated	10th	January,	2014,	the	GOI	 notified	the	New	Domestic	Natural	Gas	Pricing	Guidelines,	2014,	on	26th	October,	2014.
Consequent	to	the	aforesaid	 dispute	referred	to	under	32.3		above	which	has	been	referred	to	arbitration,	the	GOI	has	directed	the	Company	to	instruct	 customers	to	deposit	differential	revenue	on	gas	sales	from	D1D3	field	on	account	of	the	prices	determined	under	the	 above	guidelines	converted	to	NCV	basis	and	the	prevailing	price	prior	to	1st	November,	2014	($	4.205	per	MMBTU)	to	be	 credited	to	the	gas	pool	account	maintained	by	GAIL	(India)	Limited.

Revenue	 has	been	recognized	at	the	GOI	notified	prices	in	respect	of	gas	quantities	sold	from	D1D3	field	from	1st	November,	2014.
Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 333  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Standalone Financial Statements 	 (c)	 	The	Company	and	BG	Exploration	and	Production	India	Limited	(together,	the	’Claimants‘)	referred	a	number	of	disputes,	 differences	and	claims	arising	under	two	Production	Sharing	Contract	entered	into	in	1994	among	the	Claimants,	Oil	and	 Natural	Gas	Corporation	Limited	(ONCG)	and	the	Government	(the	PSCs’)	to	arbitration.
The	disputes	relate	to,	among	 other	things,	the	limits	of	cost	recovery,	profit	sharing	and	audit	and	accounting	provisions	of	the	PSCs.
The	Arbitration	 Tribunal	by	majority	issued	a	final	partial	award	(“FPA”),	and	separately,	two	dissenting	opinions	in	the	matter	on	12	 October	2016.
The	FPA	does	not	conclude	these	proceedings	as:	(1)	the	Claimants	have	challenged	certain	parts	of	the	 FPA	before	the	English	Commercial	Court	and	the	Court	has	delivered	its	judgment	on	16	April	2018	wherein	it	decided	 one	of	the	issues	in	Claimants	favour	and	this	issue	will	be	now	remitted	back	to	the	Tribunal	for	determination;	and	(2)	 after	this	determination	there	are	two	further	phases	of	the	arbitration	to	be	determined	by	the	Tribunal	viz.
CRL	Increase	 and	Quantification	of	Final	Award	yet	to	take	place.
The	Company	has	been	notified	by	Government	of	its	computation	 of	the	purported	share	of	Government’s	Profit	Petroleum	and	Royalty	alleged	to	be	payable	by	the	Contractor	pursuant	 to	the	Government’s	interpretation	of	the	FPA.
In	Company’s	view	Government’s	demand	notice	is	premature	since	 the	quantification	of	liabilities	(if	any)	of	the	parties	arising	out	of	FPA	have	to	be	determined	by	the	Arbitration	Tribunal	 after	the	Parties	have	made	their	respective	submissions	on	CRL	increase	and	quantification.
The	Company	has	already	 responded	to	the	Government’s	demand	notice	appropriately.
The	Company	is	in	the	process	of	reviewing	the	English	court	 judgment	and	will	take	appropriate	next	steps.
(d)	 	NTPC	had	filed	a	suit	for	specific	performance	of	a	contract	for	supply	of	natural	gas	by	the	Company	before	the	Hon’ble	 Bombay	High	Court.
The	main	issue	in	dispute	is	whether	a	valid,	concluded	and	binding	contract	exists	between	the	parties	 for	supply	of	Natural	Gas	of	132	Trillion	BTU	annually	for	a	period	of	17	years.
The	matter	is	presently	sub	judice	and	the	 Company is of the view that NTPC’s claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between  NTPC	and	the	Company.
(e)	 	Considering	the	complexity	of	above	issues,	the	Company	is	of	the	view	that	any	attempt	for	quantification	of	possible	 exposure	to	the	Company	will	have	an	effect	of	prejudicing	Company’s	legal	position	in	the	ongoing	arbitration/litigations.

Corporate Overview  Management Review Governance Financial Statements 274-425 Notice Annexure 1  T o the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements of  Reliance	Industries	Limited Report on the Internal Financial Controls under  Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the  Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements	of	Reliance	Industries	Limited	as	of	and	for	the	 year	ended	March	31,	2018,	we	have	audited	the	internal	 financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	of	Reliance	Industries	 Limited	(hereinafter	referred	to	as	the	“Holding	Company”),	 its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’ s Responsibility for Internal Financial  Controls The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company,  its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which are  companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing  and	maintaining	internal	financial	controls	based	on	the	internal	 control	over	financial	reporting	criteria	established	by	the	Holding	 Company considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls	Over	Financial	Reporting	issued	by	the	Institute	of	 Chartered Accountants of India.
These responsibilities include the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial	controls	that	were	operating	effectively	for	ensuring	the	 orderly	and	efficient	conduct	of	its	business,	including	adherence	 to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its  assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the  timely	preparation	of	reliable	financial	information,	as	required	 under the Act.
Auditor’ s Responsibility Our	responsibility	is	to	express	an	opinion	on	the	Holding	 Company its subsidiaries, its associates and joint ventures, which  are	companies	incorporated	in	India,	internal	financial	controls	 over	financial	reporting	based	on	our	audit.
We	conducted	our	 audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial	Controls	Over	Financial	Reporting	(the	“Guidance	Note”)	 and	the	Standards	on	Auditing	as	specified	under	Section	143(10)	 of	the	Companies	Act,	2013,	to	the	extent	applicable	to	an	audit	 of	internal	financial	controls,	both	issued	by	Institute	of	Chartered	 Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate	internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	 was established and maintained and if such controls operated  effectively	in	all	material	respects.
Our	audit	involves	performing	procedures	to	obtain	audit	evidence	 about	the	adequacy	of	the	internal	financial	controls	system	over	 financial	reporting	and	their	operating	effectiveness.
Our	audit	 of	internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	included	 obtaining	an	understanding	of	internal	financial	controls	over	 financial	reporting,	assessing	the	risk	that	a	material	weakness	 exists,	and	testing	and	evaluating	the	design	and	operating	 effectiveness	of	internal	control	based	on	the	assessed	risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  the	financial	statements,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit  evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports  referred	to	in	the	Other	Matters	paragraph	below,	is	sufficient	and	 appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal  financial	controls	system	over	financial	reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial  Reporting A	company’s	internal	financial	control	over	financial	reporting	is	a	 process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability	of	financial	reporting	and	the	preparation	of	financial	 statements	for	external	purposes	in	accordance	with	generally	 accepted	accounting	principles.
A	company’s	internal	financial	 control	over	financial	reporting	includes	those	policies	and	 procedures	that	(1)	pertain	to	the	maintenance	of	records	that,	 in	reasonable	detail,	accurately	and	fairly	reflect	the	transactions	 and	dispositions	of	the	assets	of	the	company;	(2)	provide	 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to	permit	preparation	of	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures	of	the	company	are	being	made	only	in	accordance	 with authorisations of management and directors of the company;  and	(3)	provide	reasonable	assurance	regarding	prevention	or	 timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition  of	the	company’s	assets	that	could	have	a	material	effect	on	the	 financial	statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting Because	of	the	inherent	limitations	of	internal	financial	controls	 over	financial	reporting,	including	the	possibility	of	collusion	 or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	to	future	periods	are	 subject	to	the	risk	that	the	internal	financial	control	over	financial	 349  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 reporting may become inadequate because of changes in  conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to  the	explanations	given	to	us	and	based	on	the	consideration	 of	reports	of	other	auditors,	as	referred	to	in	Other	Matters	 paragraph, the Holding Company, its subsidiaries, its associates  and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India,  have, maintained in all material respects, an adequate internal  financial	controls	system	over	financial	reporting	and	such	 internal	financial	controls	over	financial	reporting	were	operating	 effectively	as	at	March	31,	2018,	based	on	the	internal	control	over	 financial	reporting	criteria	established	by	the	Holding	Company	 considering the essential components of internal control stated  in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over	Financial	Reporting	issued	by	the	Institute	of	Chartered	 Accountants of India.
Other Matters Our	report	under	Section	143(3)(i)	of	the	Act	on	the	adequacy	 and	operating	effectiveness	of	the	internal	financial	controls	over	 financial	reporting	of	the	Holding	Company,	in	so	far	as	it	relates	 to	separate	financial	statements	of	80	subsidiaries,	13	associates	 and 14 joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India,  is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such  subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures incorporated in India.

Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost and any  cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign  exchange	contracts	and	adjustments	arising	from	exchange	rate	variations	attributable	to	the	assets.
In	case	of	land	 the Company has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.
Subsequent costs are included  in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future  economic	benefits	associated	with	the	item	will	flow	to	the	entity	and	the	cost	can	be	measured	reliably.
Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	which	are	significant	to	the	total	cost	of	that	item	of	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	 and	having	different	useful	life	are	accounted	separately.
Other	Indirect	Expenses	incurred	relating	to	project,	net	of	income	earned	during	the	project	development	stage	 prior	to	its	intended	use,	are	considered	as	pre	-	operative	expenses	and	disclosed	under	Capital	Work	-	in	-	Progress.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice 	 	 	 	Gains	or	losses	arising	from	derecognition	of	a	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	are	measured	as	the	difference	 between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated  Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	when	the	asset	is	derecognised.
(b) Leases 	 	 	 	Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	lease,	transfer	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	 of	ownership	to	the	lessee.
All	other	leases	are	classified	as	operating	leases.
Leased	Assets:	Assets	held	under	finance	leases	are	initially	recognised	as	assets	of	the	Group	at	their	fair	value	at	 the inception of the lease or , if lower , at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability  to	the	lessor	is	included	in	the	balance	sheet	as	a	finance	lease	obligation.
Lease	payments	are	apportioned	between	finance	expenses	and	reduction	of	the	lease	obligation	so	as	to	achieve	 a	constant	rate	of	interest	on	the	remaining	balance	of	the	liability.
Finance	expenses	are	recognised	immediately	in	 Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	unless	they	are	directly	attributable	to	qualifying	assets,	in	which	case	 they	are	capitalized.
Contingent	rentals	are	recognised	as	expenses	in	the	periods	in	which	they	are	incurred.
A	leased	asset	is	depreciated	over	the	useful	life	of	the	asset	ranging	from	18	years	to	99	years.
However,	if	there	is	no	 reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over  the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Operating	lease	payments	are	recognised	as	an	expense	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	on	a	 straight-line	basis	over	the	lease	term	except	where	another	systematic	basis	is	more	representative	of	time	pattern	 in	which	economic	benefits	from	the	leased	assets	are	consumed.
(c) Other Intangible Assets 	 	 	 	Other	Intangible	Assets	are	stated	at	cost	of	acquisition	net	of	recoverable	taxes,	trade	discount	and	rebates	less	 accumulated amortisation/ depletion and impairment loss, if any.
Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs,  and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use, net charges  on	foreign	exchange	contracts	and	adjustments	arising	from	exchange	rate	variations	attributable	to	the	Other	 Intangible	Assets.
In	case	of	certain	Other	Intangible	Assets,	the	Group	has	availed	fair	value	as	deemed	cost	on	the	 date of transition to Ind AS.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only  when	it	is	probable	that	future	economic	benefits	associated	with	the	item	will	flow	to	the	entity	and	the	cost	can	be	 measured reliably.
Other	Indirect	Expenses	incurred	relating	to	project,	net	of	income	earned	during	the	project	development	stage	 prior	to	its	intended	use,	are	considered	as	pre	-	operative	expenses	and	disclosed	under	Intangible	Assets	under	 Development.
Gains	or	losses	arising	from	derecognition	of	an	Other	Intangible	Asset	are	measured	as	the	difference	between	the	 net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit	and	Loss	when	the	asset	is	derecognised.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 359  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Consolidated Financial Statements 	 	 	 	A	summary	of	the	amortisation	/	depletion	policies	applied	to	the	Group’s	Other	Intangible	Assets	to	the	extent	of	 depreciable amount is as follows: Particular Depreciation  T echnical Know-How Over	the	useful	life	of	the	underlying	assets	ranging	from	5	years	to	35	years.
Computer Software Over	a	period	of	5	to	10	years.
Development Rights Depleted using the unit of production method.
The cost of producing wells along with its  related facilities including decommissioning costs are depleted in proportion of oil and gas  production achieved vis-à-vis Proved Developed Reserves.
The cost for common facilities  including its decommissioning costs are depleted using Proved Reserves.
License	Fee Amortised	over	the	remainder	of	the	License	period	from	the	date	of	commencement	of	 the commercial operation.
Spectrum Fees Amortised from the date of commencement of commercial operation over the balance  validity	period,	based	on	the	expected	pattern	of	consumption	of	the	expected	future	 economic	benefits,	in	accordance	with	the	applicable	Accounting	Standards.
Others In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount amortised to date is not less than the aggregate  rebate availed by the Group.
The	amortisation	period	and	the	amortisation	method	for	Other	Intangible	Assets	with	a	finite	useful	life	are	 reviewed at each reporting date.
(d) Research and Development Expenditure 	 	 	 	Revenue	expenditure	pertaining	to	research	is	charged	to	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
Development	costs	of	products	are	charged	to	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	unless	a	product’s	 technological	and	commercial	feasibility	has	been	established,	in	which	case	such	expenditure	is	capitalised.
(e) Finance Cost 	 	 	 	Borrowing	costs	include	exchange	differences	arising	from	foreign	currency	borrowings	to	the	extent	they	are	 regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets.
A qualifying asset is one that  necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.
Interest	income	earned	on	the	temporary	investment	of	specific	borrowings	pending	their	expenditure	on	qualifying	 assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All	other	borrowing	costs	are	charged	to	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	for	the	period	for	which	they	 are incurred.
(f ) Inventories     Items of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any,  except	in	case	of	by-products	which	are	valued	at	net	realisable	value.
Cost	of	inventories	comprises	of	cost	of	 purchase,	cost	of	conversion	and	other	costs	including	manufacturing	overheads	net	of	recoverable	taxes	incurred	in	 bringing them to their respective present location and condition.
Cost of raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on  weighted average basis.
(g) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Intangible Assets     The Group assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and  Equipment	and	Other	Intangible	Assets	or	group	of	assets,	called	Cash	Generating	Units	(CGU)	may	be	impaired.
If	any	such	indication	exists,	the	recoverable	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	is	estimated	to	determine	the	extent	of	 impairment, if any.
When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group  estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.

For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice 	 	 	 	An	impairment	loss	is	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	to	the	extent,	asset’s	carrying	 amount	exceeds	its	recoverable	amount.
The	recoverable	amount	is	higher	of	an	asset’s	fair	value	less	cost	of	 disposal	and	value	in	use.
Value	in	use	is	based	on	the	estimated	future	cash	flows,	discounted	to	their	present	value	 using	pre-tax	discount	rate	that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	risk	specific	to	 the assets.
The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of  recoverable amount.
(h) Provisions 	 	 	 	Provisions	are	recognised	when	the	Group	has	a	present	obligation	(legal	or	constructive)	as	a	result	of	a	past	event,	 it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	of	resources	embodying	economic	benefits	will	be	required	to	settle	the	obligation	and	a	 reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If	the	effect	of	the	time	value	of	money	is	material,	provisions	are	discounted	using	a	current	pre-tax	rate	that	 reflects,	when	appropriate,	the	risks	specific	to	the	liability.
When	discounting	is	used,	the	increase	in	the	provision	 due	to	the	passage	of	time	is	recognised	as	a	finance	cost.
Provision	for	Decommissioning	Liability     The Group records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity.
Decommissioning costs  are	provided	at	the	present	value	of	future	expenditure	using	a	current	pre-tax	rate	expected	to	be	incurred	to	fulfil	 decommissioning obligations and are recognized as part of the cost of the underlying assets.
Any change in the  present	value	of	the	expenditure,	other	than	unwinding	of	discount	on	the	provision,	is	reflected	as	adjustment	to	the	 provision and the corresponding asset.
The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognized in  the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
(i) Employee Benefits Expense    Short T erm Employee Benefits 	 	 	 	The	undiscounted	amount	of	short	term	employee	benefits	expected	to	be	paid	in	exchange	for	the	services	 rendered	by	employees	are	recognised	as	an	expense	during	the	period	when	the	employees	render	the	services.
Post-Employment Benefits    Defined Contribution Plans 	 	 	 	The	Group	recognizes	contribution	payable	to	the	provident	fund	scheme	as	an	expense,	when	an	employee	renders	 the related service.
If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date  exceeds	the	contribution	already	paid,	the	deficit	payable	to	the	scheme	is	recognized	as	a	liability	after	deducting	 the	contribution	already	paid.
If	the	contribution	already	paid	exceeds	the	contribution	due	for	services	received	 before	the	balance	sheet	date,	then	excess	is	recognized	as	an	asset	to	the	extent	that	the	pre-payment	will	lead	to,	 for	example,	a	reduction	in	future	payment	or	refund.
Defined Benefit Plans 	 	 	 	The	Group	pays	gratuity	to	the	employees	who	have	completed	five	years	of	service	at	the	time	of	resignation/ superannuation.
The gratuity is paid @15 days salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of  Gratuity	Act	1972.
The	gratuity	liability	amount	is	contributed	to	the	approved	gratuity	fund	formed	exclusively	for	gratuity	payment	to	 the	employees.
The	gratuity	fund	has	been	approved	by	respective	Income	Tax	authorities.
The	liability	in	respect	of	gratuity	and	other	post-employment	benefits	is	calculated	using	the	Projected	Unit	Credit	 Method	and	spread	over	the	period	during	which	the	benefit	is	expected	to	be	derived	from	employees’	services.
Re-measurement	of	Defined	Benefit	Plans	in	respect	of	post-employment	are	charged	to	the	Other	Comprehensive	 Income.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 361  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Consolidated Financial Statements    Employee Separation Costs     Compensation to employees who have opted for retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme is payable in the  year	of	exercise	of	option	by	the	employee.
The	Group	recognises	the	employee	separation	cost	when	the	scheme	is	 announced and the Group is demonstrably committed to it.
(j) T ax Expenses 	 	 	 	The	tax	expense	for	the	period	comprises	of	current	tax	and	deferred	income	tax.
Tax	is	recognised	in	Consolidated	 Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	except	to	the	extent	that	it	relates	to	items	recognised	in	the	Other	Comprehensive	 Income	or	in	Equity.
In	which	case,	the	tax	is	also	recognised	in	Other	Comprehensive	Income	or	Equity.
i.
Current T ax 	 	 	 	 	Current	tax	assets	and	liabilities	are	measured	at	the	amount	expected	to	be	recovered	from	or	paid	to	the	 taxation	authorities,	based	on	tax	rates	and	laws	that	are	enacted	at	the	Balance	sheet	date.
ii.
Deferred T ax 	 	 	 	 	Deferred	tax	is	recognised	on	temporary	differences	between	the	carrying	amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	in	 the	financial	statements	and	the	corresponding	tax	bases	used	in	the	computation	of	taxable	profit.
Deferred	tax	liabilities	and	assets	are	measured	at	the	tax	rates	that	are	expected	to	apply	in	the	period	in	 which	the	liability	is	settled	or	the	asset	realised,	based	on	tax	rates	(and	tax	laws)	that	have	been	enacted	or	 substantively	enacted	by	the	end	of	the	reporting	period.
The	carrying	amount	of	deferred	tax	liabilities	and	 assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.
(k) Share Based Payments     Equity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair  value of the equity instruments at the grant date.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity- settled	share	based	payments	transactions	are	set	out	in	Note	24.3.
The	fair	value	determined	at	the	grant	date	of	the	equity-settled	share	based	payments	is	expensed	on	a	straight	line	 basis over the vesting period, based on the Group`s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a  corresponding increase in equity.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number  of	equity	instruments	expected	to	vest.
The	impact	of	the	revision	of	the	original	estimates,	if	any,	is	recognised	in	 Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	such	that	the	cumulative	expenses	reflects	the	revised	estimate,	with	a	 corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve.
The	dilutive	effect	of	outstanding	options	is	reflected	as	additional	share	dilution	in	the	computation	of	diluted	 earnings per share.
(l) Foreign Currencies T ransactions and T ranslation 	 	 	 	Transactions	in	foreign	currencies	are	recorded	at	the	exchange	rate	prevailing	on	the	date	of	transaction.
Monetary	 assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency’s closing rates of  exchange	at	the	reporting	date.
Exchange	differences	arising	on	settlement	or	translation	of	monetary	items	are	recognised	in	Consolidated	 Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	except	to	the	extent	of	exchange	differences	which	are	regarded	as	an	adjustment	 to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction  of	qualifying	assets,	are	capitalized	as	cost	of	assets.
Additionally,	exchange	gains	or	losses	on	foreign	currency	 borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are  adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the  exchange	rates	at	the	date	of	the	transaction.
Non-monetary	items	measured	at	fair	value	in	a	foreign	currency	 are	translated	using	the	exchange	rates	at	the	date	when	the	fair	value	was	measured.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on  the	change	in	fair	value	of	the	item	(i.e.,	translation	differences	on	items	whose	fair	value	gain	or	loss	is	recognised	in	 Other	Comprehensive	Income	or	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	are	also	recognised	in	Other	Comprehensive	Income	 or	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	respectively).
(m) Revenue Recognition 	 	 	 	Revenue	from	sale	of	goods	is	recognised	when	the	significant	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	have	been	transferred	 to the buyer , recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated cost can be estimated reliably, there is no  continuing	effective	control	or	managerial	involvement	with	the	goods,	and	the	amount	of	revenue	can	be	measured	 reliably.
Revenue	from	Operations	is	measured	at	the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	received	or	receivable,	taking	into	 account	contractually	defined	terms	of	payment	and	excluding	taxes	or	duties	collected	on	behalf	of	the	government.
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised when the performance of agreed contractual task has been  completed.
Revenue also includes revenue towards sharing infrastructure for usage of network by other operators.
Revenue  from membership fees are recognised ratably over the membership period.
Revenue from other services including  advertisement is recognized on rendering services.
In case of revenue from multiple deliverables, the consideration received from customers is allocated to each  separate	unit	of	identifiable	deliverable	based	on	its	relative	fair	value.
In	case	the	relative	fair	value	of	different	 components cannot be determined on a reasonable basis, the total consideration is allocated on a residual value  method.
Interest Income 	 	 	 	Interest	Income	from	a	financial	asset	is	recognised	using	Effective	Interest	Rate	Method.
Dividend Income     Dividend Income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the amount has been established.
(n) Financial Instruments    i.
Financial Assets     A.
Initial Recognition and Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	All	financial	assets	are	initially	recognized	at	fair	value.
Transaction	costs	that	are	directly	attributable	 to	the	acquisition	or	issue	of	financial	assets,	which	are	not	at	Fair	Value	Through	Profit	or	Loss,	are	 adjusted	to	the	fair	value	on	initial	recognition.
Purchase	and	sale	of	financial	assets	are	recognised	using	 trade date accounting.
B.
Subsequent Measurement      a) Financial assets measured at Amortised Cost (AC) 	 	 	 	 	 	 	A	financial	asset	is	measured	at	Amortised	Cost	if	it	is	held	within	a	business	model	whose	 objective	is	to	hold	the	asset	in	order	to	collect	contractual	cash	flows	and	the	contractual	terms	 of	the	financial	asset	give	rise	on	specified	dates	to	cash	flows	that	are	solely	payments	of	principal	 and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) 	 	 	 	 	 	 	A	financial	asset	is	measured	at	FVTOCI	if	it	is	held	within	a	business	model	whose	objective	is	 achieved	by	both	collecting	contractual	cash	flows	and	selling	financial	assets	and	the	contractual	 terms	of	the	financial	asset	give	rise	on	specified	dates	to	cash	flows	that	are	solely	payments	of	 principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 363  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Consolidated Financial Statements      c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) 	 	 	 	 	 	 A	financial	asset	which	is	not	classified	in	any	of	the	above	categories	are	measured	at	FVTPL.
C. Other Equity Investments       All other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Consolidated  Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	except	for	those	equity	investments	for	which	the	Group	has	elected	to	 present	the	value	changes	in	‘Other	Comprehensive	Income’.
D. Impairment of Financial Assets 	 	 	 	 	 	In	accordance	with	Ind	AS	109,	the	Group	uses	‘Expected	Credit	Loss’	(ECL)	model,	for	evaluating	 impairment	of	financial	assets	other	than	those	measured	at	Fair	Value	Through	Profit	and	Loss	(FVTPL).
Expected	credit	losses	are	measured	through	a	loss	allowance	at	an	amount	equal	to: 	 	 	 	 	 •	 	The	12-months	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	those	default	 events	on	the	financial	instrument	that	are	possible	within	12	months	after	the	reporting	date);	or 	 	 	 	 	 •	 	Full	lifetime	expected	credit	losses	(expected	credit	losses	that	result	from	all	possible	default	 events	over	the	life	of	the	financial	instrument).
For	trade	receivables,	the	Group	applies	‘simplified	approach’	which	requires	expected	lifetime	losses	 to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
The Group uses historical default rates to  determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables.
At every reporting date these historical  default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward looking estimates are analysed.
For	other	assets,	the	Group	uses	12	month	Expected	Credit	Loss	to	provide	for	impairment	loss	where	 there	is	no	significant	increase	in	credit	risk.
If	there	is	significant	increase	in	credit	risk	full	lifetime	 Expected	Credit	Loss	is	used.
ii.
Financial Liabilities     A.
Initial Recognition and Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	All	financial	liabilities	are	recognized	at	fair	value	and	in	case	of	borrowings,	net	of	directly	attributable	 cost.
Fees	of	recurring	nature	are	directly	recognised	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	as	 finance	cost.
B.
Subsequent Measurement 	 	 	 	 	 	Financial	liabilities	are	carried	at	amortized	cost	using	the	effective	interest	method.
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying  amounts	approximate	fair	value	due	to	the	short	maturity	of	these	instruments.
iii.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting 	 	 	 	 	The	Group	uses	various	derivative	financial	instruments	such	as	interest	rate	swaps,	currency	swaps,	forwards	 and	options	and	commodity	contracts	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	changes	in	interest	rates,	exchange	rates	and	 commodity	prices.
Such	derivative	financial	instruments	are	initially	recognised	at	fair	value	on	the	date	on	 which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value.
Derivatives  are	carried	as	financial	assets	when	the	fair	value	is	positive	and	as	financial	liabilities	when	the	fair	value	is	 negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Consolidated  Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	except	for	the	effective	portion	of	cash	flow	hedge	which	is	recognised	in	Other	 Comprehensive	Income	and	later	to	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss,	when	the	hedged	item	affects	 profit	or	loss	or	is	treated	as	basis	adjustment	if	a	hedged	forecast	transaction	subsequently	results	in	the	 recognition	of	a	non-financial	assets	or	non-financial	liability.

For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice     Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:     A.
Cash Flow Hedge 	 	 	 	 	 	The	Group	designates	derivative	contracts	or	non-derivative	financial	assets	/	liabilities	as	hedging	 instruments	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	movement	in	interest	rates	and	foreign	exchange	rates	for	foreign	 exchange	exposure	on	highly	probable	future	cash	flows	attributable	to	a	recognised	asset	or	liability	 or	forecast	cash	transactions.
When	a	derivative	is	designated	as	a	cash	flow	hedging	instrument,	the	 effective	portion	of	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	derivative	is	recognized	in	the	cash	flow	hedging	 reserve	being	part	of	Other	Comprehensive	Income.
Any	ineffective	portion	of	changes	in	the	fair	 value	of	the	derivative	is	recognized	immediately	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
If	 the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued	prospectively.
If	the	hedging	instrument	expires	or	is	sold,	terminated	or	exercised,	the	 cumulative	gain	or	loss	on	the	hedging	instrument	recognized	in	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	till	the	period	 the	hedge	was	effective	remains	in	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	until	the	underlying	transaction	occurs.
The	cumulative	gain	or	loss	previously	recognized	in	the	cash	flow	hedging	reserve	is	transferred	to	 the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss	upon	the	occurrence	of	the	underlying	transaction.
If	 the	forecasted	transaction	is	no	longer	expected	to	occur,	then	the	amount	accumulated	in	cash	flow	 hedging	reserve	is	reclassified	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
B.
Fair Value Hedge 	 	 	 	 	 	The	Group	designates	derivative	contracts	or	non-derivative	financial	assets	/	liabilities	as	hedging	 instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest  rates,	foreign	exchange	rates	and	commodity	prices.
Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair  value	hedges	are	recorded	in	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
If	the	hedging	relationship	 no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged  item	for	which	the	effective	interest	method	is	used	is	amortised	to	Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	 and	Loss	over	the	period	of	maturity.
iv.
Derecognition of Financial Instruments 	 	 	 	 	The	Group	derecognizes	a	financial	asset	when	the	contractual	rights	to	the	cash	flows	from	the	financial	asset	 expire	or	it	transfers	the	financial	asset	and	the	transfer	qualifies	for	derecognition	under	Ind	AS	109	-	Financial	 Instruments.
A	financial	liability	(or	a	part	of	a	financial	liability)	is	derecognized	from	the	Group’s	Balance	Sheet	 when	the	obligation	specified	in	the	contract	is	discharged	or	cancelled	or	expires.
v. Offsetting 	 	 	 	 	Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	offset	and	the	net	amount	is	presented	in	the	Balance	Sheet	when,	 and	only	when,	the	Group	has	a	legally	enforceable	right	to	set	off	the	amount	and	it	intends,	either	to	settle	 them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(o) Accounting For Oil and Gas Activity 	 	 	 	The	Group	has	adopted	Successful	Efforts	Method	(SEM)	of	accounting	for	its	Oil	and	Gas	activities.
The	policy	of	 recognition	of	exploration	and	evaluation	expenditure	is	considered	in	line	with	the	principle	of	SEM.
Seismic	costs,	 geological	and	geophysical	studies,	petroleum	exploration	license	fees	and	general	and	administration	costs	directly	 attributable	to	exploration	and	evaluation	activities	are	expensed	off.
The	costs	incurred	on	acquisition	of	interest	 in	oil	and	gas	blocks	and	on	exploration	and	evaluation	other	than	those	which	are	expensed	off	are	accounted	 for as Intangible Assets under Development.
All development costs incurred in respect of Proved Reserves are  also	capitalized	under	Intangible	Assets	under	Development.
Once	a	well	is	ready	to	commence	commercial	 production,	the	costs	accumulated	in	Intangible	Assets	under	Development	are	classified	as	Other	Intangible	 Assets	corresponding	to	proved	developed	oil	and	gas	reserves.
The	exploration	and	evaluation	expenditure	which	 does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the  Consolidated	Statement	of	Profit	and	Loss.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 365  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Consolidated Financial Statements     The Group used technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines  2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods.
The reserve review and evaluation is carried out  annually.
Oil	and	Gas	Joint	Ventures	are	in	the	nature	of	joint	operations.
Accordingly,	assets	and	liabilities	as	well	as	income	 and	expenditure	are	accounted	on	the	basis	of	available	information	on	a	line-by-line	basis	with	similar	items	in	the	 financial	statements,	according	to	the	participating	interest	of	the	Group.
C. Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 	 	 	The	preparation	of	the	Group’s	financial	statements	requires	management	to	make	judgement,	estimates	and	assumptions	 that	affect	the	reported	amount	of	revenue,	expenses,	assets	and	liabilities	and	the	accompanying	disclosures.
Uncertainty	 about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying  amount	of	assets	or	liabilities	affected	in	future	periods.
(a) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves 	 	 	 	The	determination	of	the	Group’s	estimated	oil	and	natural	gas	reserves	requires	significant	judgements	and	 estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological  and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and  commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves.
The  Group bases it’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and  commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Group’s oil and gas  properties.
The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the  remaining	carrying	value	of	the	asset	over	the	expected	future	production.
Oil	and	natural	gas	reserves	also	have	a	 direct	impact	on	the	assessment	of	the	recoverability	of	asset	carrying	values	reported	in	the	financial	statements.
Details	on	proved	reserves	and	production	both	on	product	and	geographical	basis	are	provided	in	Note	29.2.
(b) Decommissioning Liabilities     The liability for decommissioning costs are recognized when the Group has an obligation to perform site restoration  activity.
The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and  assumptions.
These include the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the  ultimate	life	of	the	field,	expected	utilization	of	assets	by	other	fields,	the	scope	of	abandonment	activity	and	pre-tax	 rate applied for discounting.
(c) Depreciation / Amortisation and useful lives of Property Plant and Equipment / Other Intangible Assets 	 	 	 	Property,	Plant	and	Equipment	/	Other	Intangible	Assets	are	depreciated	/	amortised	over	their	estimated	useful	 lives, after taking into account estimated residual value.
Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual  values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation / amortisation to be recorded during  any	reporting	period.
The	useful	lives	and	residual	values	are	based	on	the	Group’s	historical	experience	with	similar	 assets and take into account anticipated technological changes.
The depreciation / amortisation for future periods is  revised	if	there	are	significant	changes	from	previous	estimates.
(d) Recoverability of T rade Receivables     Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a  provision against those receivables is required.
Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the  amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of  non-payment.

For Everyone.
Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice   (e) Provisions 	 	 	 	Provisions	and	liabilities	are	recognized	in	the	period	when	it	becomes	probable	that	there	will	be	a	future	outflow	 of	funds	resulting	from	past	operations	or	events	and	the	amount	of	cash	outflow	can	be	reliably	estimated.
The	 timing	of	recognition	and	quantification	of	the	liability	requires	the	application	of	judgement	to	existing	facts	and	 circumstances, which can be subject to change.
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed  regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.
(f ) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets     The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any  indication	exists,	the	Group	estimates	the	asset’s	recoverable	amount.
An	asset’s	recoverable	amount	is	the	higher	 of	an	asset’s	or	Cash	Generating	Units	(CGU’s)	fair	value	less	costs	of	disposal	and	its	value	in	use.
It	is	determined	for	 an	individual	asset,	unless	the	asset	does	not	generate	cash	inflows	that	are	largely	independent	of	those	from	other	 assets	or	a	groups	of	assets.
Where	the	carrying	amount	of	an	asset	or	CGU	exceeds	its	recoverable	amount,	the	 asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In	assessing	value	in	use,	the	estimated	future	cash	flows	are	discounted	to	their	present	value	using	pre-tax	 discount	rate	that	reflects	current	market	assessments	of	the	time	value	of	money	and	the	risks	specific	to	the	 asset.
In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such  transactions	can	be	identified,	an	appropriate	valuation	model	is	used.
(g) Impairment of Financial Assets 	 	 	 	The	impairment	provisions	for	financial	assets	are	based	on	assumptions	about	risk	of	default	and	expected	cash	 loss rates.
The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment  calculation,	based	on	it’s	past	history,	existing	market	conditions	as	well	as	forward	looking	estimates	at	the	end	of	 each reporting period.
D. Standards Issued but not Effective 	 	 	On	March	28,	2018,	the	Ministry	of	Corporate	Affairs	(MCA)	has	notified	Ind	AS	115	-	Revenue	from	Contract	with	 Customers	and	certain	amendment	to	existing	Ind	AS.
These	amendments	shall	be	applicable	to	the	Group	from	  April 01, 2018.
(a) Issue of Ind AS 115 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers     Ind AS 115 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including Ind AS 18 - Revenue, Ind AS 11  Construction Contracts and the related interpretations.
Ind AS 115 provides a single model of accounting for revenue  arising	from	contracts	with	customers	based	on	the	identification	and	satisfaction	of	performance	obligations.
(b) Amendment to existing issued Ind AS     The MCA has also carried out amendments of the following accounting standards: 	 	 	 i.	 Ind	AS	21	-	The	Effects	of	Changes	in	Foreign	Exchange	Rates    ii.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2018 389  Integrated Annual Report 2017–18 Consolidated Financial Statements 	 	 	 	The	Expected	Rate	of	Return	on	Plan	Assets	is	determined	considering	several	applicable	factors,	mainly	the	composition	 of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for Plan Assets  Management.
VII)   The	expected	contributions	for	Defined	Benefit	Plan	for	the	next	financial	year	will	be	in	line	with	financial	year	2017-18.
VIII)   These	plan’s	typically	expose	the	Group	to	actuarial	risks	such	as:	Investment	Risk,	Interest	Risk,	Longevity	Risk	and	 Salary Risk.
Investment  Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	plan	liability	is	calculated	using	a	discount	rate	which	is	 determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest  Risk A	decrease	in	the	bond	interest	rate	will	increase	the	plan	liability;	however,	this	will	be	partially	offset	 by an increase in the return on the plan debt investments.
Longevity	 Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	benefit	plan	liability	is	calculated	by	reference	to	the	best	estimate	 of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life  expectancy	of	the	plan	participants	will	increase	the	plan’s liability.
Salary   Risk The	present	value	of	the	defined	plan	liability	is	calculated	by	reference	to	the	future	salaries	of	plan	 participants.

Based	on	legal	advice	received,	the	Company	continues	to	maintain	that	 a Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the  Government	to	disallow	the	recovery	of	any	Contract	Cost	as	defined	in	the	PSC.
The	Company	has	already	referred	the	issue	 to	arbitration	and	the	arbitration	is	currently	underway.
Pending	decision	of	the	arbitration,	the	demand	from	the	GOI	of	$	148	 million	being	the	Company’s	Share	(total	demand	$	247	million)	towards	additional	Profit	Petroleum	has	been	considered	as	 contingent liability.

In carrying out petroleum operations, the Contractor has worked within  the boundaries of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the PSC.
The Company has already invoked the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issued a Notice of Arbitration to  the Government on 11th November , 2016.
The Company remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate  its position that the Government’s claim is not sustainable.
The arbitration hearings are over and the arbitral award is  awaited.
(b)	 	In	supersession	of	the	Ministry’s	Gazette	notification	no.

dated	10th	January,	2014,	the	GOI	 notified	the	New	Domestic	Natural	Gas	Pricing	Guidelines,	2014,	on	26th	October,	2014.
Consequent	to	the	aforesaid	 dispute	referred	to	under	30.3		above	which	has	been	referred	to	arbitration,	the	GOI	has	directed	the	Company	to	 instruct	customers	to	deposit	differential	revenue	on	gas	sales	from	D1D3	field	on	account	of	the	prices	determined	 under	the	above	guidelines	converted	to	NCV	basis	and	the	prevailing	price	prior	to	1st	November,	2014	($	4.205	 per	MMBTU)	to	be	credited	to	the	gas	pool	account	maintained	by	GAIL	(India)	Limited.
The	amount	so	deposited	 by customer to Gas Pool Account is `	295	crore	(net)	as	at	31st	March,	2018	is	disclosed	under	Other	Non	-Current	 Assets.
Revenue	has	been	recognized	at	the	GOI	notified	prices	in	respect	of	gas	quantities	sold	from	D1D3	field	 from 1st November , 2014.
(c)	 	The	Company	and	BG	Exploration	and	Production	India	Limited	(together,	the	’Claimants‘)	referred	a	number	of	 disputes,	differences	and	claims	arising	under	two	Production	Sharing	Contract	entered	into	in	1994	among	the	 Claimants,	Oil	and	Natural	Gas	Corporation	Limited	(ONCG)	and	the	Government	(the	PSCs’)	to	arbitration.
The	 disputes	relate	to,	among	other	things,	the	limits	of	cost	recovery,	profit	sharing	and	audit	and	accounting	provisions	 of	the	PSCs.
The	Arbitration	Tribunal	by	majority	issued	a	final	partial	award	(“FPA”),	and	separately,	two	dissenting	 opinions	in	the	matter	on	12	October	2016.
The	FPA	does	not	conclude	these	proceedings	as:	(1)	the	Claimants	have	 challenged certain parts of the FPA before the English Commercial Court and the Court has delivered its judgment  on 16 April 2018 wherein it decided one of the issues in Claimants favour and this issue will be now remitted back  to	the	Tribunal	for	determination;	and	(2)	after	this	determination	there	are	two	further	phases	of	the	arbitration	to	 be	determined	by	the	Tribunal	viz.

Corporate Overview  Management Review  Governance  Financial Statements 274-425 Notice has	been	notified	by	Government	of	its	computation	of	the	purported	share	of	Government’s	Profit	Petroleum	 and Royalty alleged to be payable by the Contractor pursuant to the Government’s interpretation of the FPA.
In  Company’s	view	Government’s	demand	notice	is	premature	since	the	quantification	of	liabilities	(if	any)	of	the	parties	 arising out of FPA have to be determined by the Arbitration T ribunal after the Parties have made their respective  submissions	on	CRL	increase	and	quantification.
The	Company	has	already	responded	to	the	Government’s	demand	 notice appropriately.
The Company is in the process of reviewing the English court judgment and will take appropriate  next	steps.
(d)	 	NTPC	had	filed	a	suit	for	specific	performance	of	a	contract	for	supply	of	natural	gas	by	the	Company	before	the	 Hon’ble	Bombay	High	Court.
The	main	issue	in	dispute	is	whether	a	valid,	concluded	and	binding	contract	exists	 between	the	parties	for	supply	of	Natural	Gas	of	132	Trillion	BTU	annually	for	a	period	of	17	years.
The	matter	is	 presently sub judice and the Company is of the view that NTPC’s claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply  of	gas	was	executed	between	NTPC	and	the	Company.
(e)	 	Considering	the	complexity	of	above	issues,	the	Company	is	of	the	view	that	any	attempt	for	quantification	of	 possible	exposure	to	the	Company	will	have	an	effect	of	prejudicing	Company’s	legal	position	in	the	ongoing	 arbitration/litigations.
