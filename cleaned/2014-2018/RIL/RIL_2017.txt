LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Dear Fellow Shareowners, I am happy to report that we have delivered  superior financial performance, improved  capital efficiency and continued strong project  execution.
Our focus on delivery and growth  continued to yield results in what was a difficult  year for many of our peers globally.
Our  financial and operational performance in   FY 2016-17 was outstanding, reflecting in  record net profit.
I would like to express my  gratitude to everyone at Reliance for the hard  work they have put in to achieve this.
improvement in the petrochemicals and refining  margins.
Refining and petrochemicals businesses  achieved record levels of profitability, underpinned  by our ability to access feedstock competitively  from global markets, maintain high operating  rates and place products in growth markets.
The  refining business delivered double-digit GRMs for  the second year in a row, benefiting from the global  demand for transportation fuels and stable product  cracks.
Lower oil price environment continues to drive  strong demand growth across key markets.
Global  oil demand for 2016 grew by 1.6 mb/d, led by China  and India.
India has now become a major force in  driving global oil demand growth and is now the  world’s third largest oil consumer.
India’s oil demand  grew 5.2% during the year led by strong growth in  gasoline and jet fuel.
Diesel demand growth in India  however remained muted as industrial cycle lagged  consumption.
The pace of petrochemical product  demand growth was lower compared to previous  years.
Polymer demand in India was up 7% y-o-y  while polyester demand grew by 3% y-o-y.
Mukesh D. Ambani Chairman and Managing Director RECORD NET PROFIT  FOR THE YEAR LED  BY THE HIGHEST  EVER EARNINGS  FROM REFINING AND  PETROCHEMICALS  BUSINESSES Global economic growth in 2016 was stable aided  by a recovery in commodity prices and increased  global trade.
Global oil prices were supported by   co-operation between OPEC and non-OPEC  producers for cutting production.
While underlying  demand trends are encouraging, tightening rates in  US and possible end of accommodative monetary  policy in other developed countries could impact  emerging economies.
GDP growth in India was robust at 7.1%, supported  by strong consumption growth and government  spending.
The introduction of GST is a significant  reform measure and will overtime help India in  simplifying tax structure and compliance, aligning it  with practices in developed countries.
Reliance delivered robust operational and financial  performance during the year, resulting in net  profit of `29,901 crore (US$ 4.6 billion), growth of  18.8% y-o-y.
The most significant factors affecting  year-to-year comparisons of earnings and cash  flow generated by our operating activities are  9 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE  OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER  INFORMA TION RIL ’S GRM  OUTPERFORMED  SINGAPORE COMPLEX  MARGINS BY US$ 5.2/ BBL, THE HIGHEST  PREMIUM ACHIEVED IN  THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.
Refining and Marketing Refining and Marketing segment EBIT increased by  6.5% y-o-y to a record level of ` 25,056 crore   (US$ 3.9 billion), supported by higher GRM and  crude throughput.
GRM for the year stood at eight  year high level of US$ 11.0/bbl as against US$ 10.8/ bbl in the previous year.
RIL ’s GRM outperformed  Singapore complex margins by US$ 5.2/bbl, the  highest premium achieved in the last eight years.
Though regional refining margins trended  downwards, our high-conversion refining system  was able to take advantage of firm margins on  middle distillates and wider discounts on difficult- to-process crudes in a well-supplied market.
During  the year, our refineries processed 65 different grades  of crude including five new grades.
This illustrates  the flexibility and complexity of our refining assets  at Jamnagar which can process heavy and sour  crudes to produce high value transportation fuels.
During the year, light products mainly gasoline  and naphtha witnessed a sharp decline in cracks.
This was partially offset by firm middle distillate  cracks and efficient yield shift management in our  refineries to capture higher margins.
Our petroleum retail operations continued to gather  momentum with 1,221 fuel outlets operational at  the end of the year.
These outlets are registering  industry leading pump throughputs which were  as high as twice the industry average in March  2017.
Our success in petroleum retail is testimony  to our superior value proposition to consumers  and our ability to leverage technology for ensuring  consistent delivery.
These attributes have also  helped us ramp-up our bulk marketing business  leading to market share gains.
Our petcoke gasification initiative is aimed at  reducing the energy cost for the Jamnagar complex  on a sustainable basis.
We have achieved the  installation and mechanical completion for the  gasification project linked to our DTA refinery and  the pre-commissioning activities are ongoing.
On completion, this will make Jamnagar complex  highly energy efficient with the lowest energy cost  for any integrated Refinery and Petrochemicals  facility globally.
Petrochemicals Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased sharply  by 27.5% to a record level of `12,990 crore ($ 2.0  billion), supported by favorable product margins  and growth in volumes.
Favorable naphtha cracking  economics, firm domestic demand and higher  volumes in the polyester chain were the key factors  driving profitability.
EBIT margin of 14% is at a five  year high level, reflecting strong polymer margins  and recovery in polyester chain economics.
Our company continues to benefit from integrated  business model, wide product portfolio and scale  economics which provides us a high degree of  earnings stability.
India remains a key growth  market for petrochemical products in the global  context and our new capacity additions are poised  to capture growing domestic demand.
We successfully commissioned our new Paraxylene  (PX) capacity at Jamnagar.
This plant is built with  state-of-the-art crystallisation technology from  BP which is highly energy efficient.
With the  commissioning of this plant, our PX capacity has  doubled and Reliance has emerged as the world’s  second largest producer of PX with about 11% of  global production.
In order to provide feedstock security and flexibility  to our cracker portfolio on the west coast of India,  we have created a virtual floating ethane pipeline  between North America and Dahej in Gujarat.
The  ethane receipt and handling facilities at Dahej has  been commissioned in a record time of less than  three years and ethane cracking has commenced  at our crackers.
Ethane sourcing from North  America will improve the cost competitiveness of  our existing crackers and enable us to optimise the  portfolio in a volatile market environment.
At Jamnagar, we are in the process of starting up the  largest refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) in the world  along with related downstream capacities.
This is  a pioneering initiative and a unique opportunity  available at Jamnagar due to the scale of our  refinery operations.
The cracker is tightly integrated  with our refineries and will use refinery off-gases as  feedstock.
This cracker will have one of the lowest  cost positions globally.
The incremental volumes  will target a deficit Indian market which also  continues to be among the fastest growth market  for petrochemical products.
During the year, our  refineries processed 65  different grades of crude  including five new grades.
This illustrates the flexibility  and complexity of our  refining assets at Jamnagar.
R&M At Jamnagar, we are in the  process of starting up the largest  refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC)  in the world along with related  downstream capacities.

OVERVIEW GLOBAL The world economy grew at a stable pace of 3.1% in CY  2016, aided by recovery in emerging economies particularly  commodity exporters, while growth in developed markets  remained modest.
Increase in oil prices along with other  major commodities like iron ore and copper aided recovery  in global trade towards the end of CY 2016.
The uptick in global  trade was led by pickup in import demand in Asia and US which  augurs well for underlying demand trends.
While global growth  was stable, markets were focused on geopolitical developments  with change in leadership in the USA, and the UK working on  modalities around its exit from the European Union.
Activity rebounded in the USA after a weak first half of CY 2016,  as the economy approaches full employment.
The US Federal  Reserve continued with the interest rate normalisation cycle in  FY 2016-17 by increasing rates twice, in Dec 2016 and Mar 2017.
The global low interest rate and abundant liquidity cycle is likely  to slowly normalise.
INDIA On the domestic front, India remained the fastest growing  major economy in the world, after surpassing China last year.
Gross Domestic Product growth rate was 7.1% for FY 2016-17,  supported by strong consumption growth and government  spending.
Inflation eased sharply led by a decline in food  inflation amidst government’s astute food management,  facilitating a 50 basis points rate cut by the RBI in FY 2016-17  before it adopted a neutral stance.
Diminishing vulnerabilities  on the external and fiscal front with Apr-Dec FY 2016-17 current  account deficit at 0.7% of GDP and government’s commitment  to fiscal consolidation reinstated investor confidence in the  economy, resulting in record Net Foreign Direct Investment of  US$35.9 billion in FY 2016-17.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Management’ s   Discussion and Analysis 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE  OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER  INFORMA TION 59 The refining business had another  stellar year - achieving record  profits and 8 year high GRM   FY 2016-17 was also marked by two significant economic  measures by the government.
Government’s demonetisation  move to counter the shadow economy and promote cashless  economy has boosted digital payments in the country.
The  Goods and Services Tax (GST) - constitution amendment bill,  passed by the government, to be implemented from July   1st, 2017 will have a significant impact on the taxation structure  in the country.
The reform process would further help boost  India’s position in the global arena.
Global oil demand growth remained robust at 1.6 million barrels  per day in CY 2016 led by a 3.3 % y-o-y growth in demand from  the non-OECD countries.
Gasoline demand trends remained  robust contributing around 40% of global oil demand growth.
US, China and India accounted for 60% of the global gasoline  demand growth.
Global oil price strengthened in FY 2016- 17, supported by the OPEC non-OPEC co-operation to cut oil  production in the last quarter of CY 2016.
India became the second largest contributor to the global oil  demand growth in terms of incremental oil demand.
India also  overtook Japan as the world’s third largest oil consumer (after  USA and China).
During FY 2016-17, India's oil demand grew 5.2% led by strong  consumption demand growth in gasoline (+8.8%) and jet  kerosene (+12.1%).
This was underpinned by 9.2% growth in  passenger vehicle sales, 6.9% growth in two-wheelers sales and  21.7% growth in domestic airline passenger traffic.
Domestic  diesel demand remained muted at 1.8% as the industrial  cycle lagged consumption.
Polymer demand grew by 7% and  polyester demand grew by 3% during FY 2016-17.
With the advent of Jio in the domestic digital services market,  the Indian telecom industry witnessed unprecedented growth  in data consumption.
Over a 100 million Jio users propelled  India into the largest mobile data usage market globally, with  monthly data consumption of over 1bn GBs.
HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY EVENTS RIL ’s downstream hydrocarbon businesses delivered a stellar  performance in FY 2016-17.
Refining business continued  to register double digit Gross Refining Margin (GRM) and  outperformed benchmark Singapore GRMs.
Refining business  was supported by stable middle distillate cracks, benign global  demand growth and optimised crude sourcing.
Favourable  naphtha cracking economics, firm domestic demand and higher  volumes in polyester chain underpinned record earnings from  the Petrochemical business.
RIL progressed completion of the ongoing hydrocarbon  projects with the phase wise commissioning of Paraxylene plant  at Jamnagar, making it the 2nd largest producer of PX globally.
During the year, RIL completed the world’s largest and most  complex ethane sourcing project.
It commissioned ethane  receipt and handling facilities at its Dahej manufacturing  facilities in a record time of less than three years.
The Refinery  Off gas Cracker (ROGC) and downstream projects as well as  gasification linked to Domestic Tariff Area refinery achieved  the installation and mechanical completion during the year  and pre-commissioning and start-up activities are in full swing.
The installation and mechanical completion for the gasification  linked to RIL ’s SEZ refinery has also been substantially  achieved.
The completion of the hydrocarbon capex cycle will  significantly enhance RIL ’s cash flows and impart a high degree  of stability to its earnings stream.
REFINING AND MARKETING – CONTINUED  STRONG PERFORMANCE Refining and Marketing (R&M) business delivered another  year of double digit GRMs in FY 2016-17.
Supportive product  demand environment led by India and China, firm middle  distillate spreads and well-supplied crude markets helped  the R&M business to sustain high margins.
RIL recorded GRM  of US$11.0/bbl for the year, highest in last eight years.
RIL  continued to outperform Singapore benchmark, with an eight  year high premium of US$5.2/bbl during FY 2016-17.
R&M business registered an EBIT of `25,056 crore (up 6.5%  y-o-y) supported by better volumes, yield management and  robust risk management.
During the year, RIL continued to process challenging and  advantageous crudes.
It processed 5 new crude grades in FY  2016-17.
RIL ’s refineries have now processed over 150 grades of  crude.
RIL continued to build-out its domestic retail network with  1,221 fuel outlets operational as at the end of FY 2016-17.
RIL ’s  fuel outlets registered significant volume growth with year- end exit throughput more than double the industry average,  highlighting the superior customer experience and value added  offerings.

60 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 PETROCHEMICALS – RECORD  PERFORMANCE ON VOLUME, MARGIN  EXPANSION Petrochemicals business delivered strong earnings growth led  by volume growth, favourable naphtha cracking economics  and recovery in polyester chain margins.
Proactive inventory  management and cost-discipline helped RIL dampen the  transient impact on domestic demand growth during   FY 2016-17.
The petrochemical business posted record earnings with 5 year  high EBIT margin of 14%.
The segment EBIT stood at ` 12,990  crore in FY 2016-17, up by 27.5% y-o-y.
During FY 2016-17, RIL progressed rapidly to enhance  petrochemical capacities, strengthen integration and improve  feedstock security.
The new PX capacity will complete the  integration within RIL ’s polyester value chain, leading to  improved margins and also strengthen its position in polyester  industry globally.
The supply of ethane to RIL ’s crackers at  Dahej, Hazira and Nagothane will provide feedstock security  and flexibility enabling it to select the most optimal feed  mix based on market conditions.
This will improve the cost  competitiveness of its existing crackers and enable it to  optimise the portfolio in a volatile market environment.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND  PRODUCTION – CHALLENGING MACRO  ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL: SHALE GAS The commodity markets showed improving trend towards the  end of CY 2016.
However, weaker Natural Gas differentials in the  Marcellus region along with lower volumes resulted in a setback  during the year leading to lower revenues and EBITDA.
Reliance Holding USA Inc., delivered negative EBIT of (` 1,430)  crore in CY 2016 compared to ` 3,280 crore in CY 2015.
Operational trends remained strong across joint ventures (JVs),  with improving costs and declining capex.
Overall volume  trends remained subdued reflecting the impact of forced  curtailment of production at Marcellus and “zero development”  strategy which are being pursued to conserve cash flows and  safeguarding investment returns in a challenging business  environment.
Consequently, production (RIL share) was  14.6% lower at 174.0 Bcfe in CY 2016.
The business is taking a  cautious approach to resuming development and focusing on  conserving cash and retaining optionality.
Domestic Oil and Gas During the year, RIL commenced commercial production  from its Coal Bed Methane block (CBM), at Sohagpur (West).
The production from RIL ’s Sohagpur CBM fields is expected  to gradually ramp-up over the next 15-18 months making RIL  among the largest unconventional natural gas producers in  India.
Operationally, FY 2016-17 continued to witness lower upstream  production and weak domestic gas price realisations.
The  domestic oil and gas production (RIL share) was down 23% to  95 billion cubic feet equivalent.
The unfavourable upstream  price environment and declining volumes resulted in negative  segment EBIT for the year at (` 131) crore.

66 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 MARKET ENVIRONMENT  ROBUST OIL DEMAND GROWTH SUSTAINED EVEN  WITH RISING OIL PRICES  Global oil demand grew 1.6 mb/d in CY 2016, after a near  record growth of 2.0 mb/d in the previous year, despite crude  oil prices trending higher.
Both OECD and Non-OECD countries  contributed to oil demand growth.
Higher demand for light  distillates supported the healthy growth in oil demand.
During CY 2016, about 45% of the global oil demand growth  came from China and India.
Chinese oil demand growth  moderated to 0.4 mb/d in CY 2016 (0.7 mb/d in CY 2015).
In  China, strong growth in gasoline demand was underpinned by  a 14% growth in car sales.
Diesel demand contracted on weaker  industrial activity in China, Government discouraging coal  production to curb pollution and shutting down of industrial  units prior to the G20 summit in Hangzhou supported demand.
India was the second largest contributor to demand growth  with 0.3 million barrels per day of growth in CY 2016.
India’s  demand growth was led by gasoline, jet-kero and LPG.
The  growth in gasoline demand was driven by strong passenger  vehicle and two-wheeler sales, which grew by 9% and 7%  respectively in FY 2016-17.

OPEC gained  significant market share in CY 2016 as OPEC supply (including  Natural Gas Liquids) grew by 1.1 mb/d.
and non-OPEC supplies  fell by 0.8 mb/d y-o-y.
Biofuels contributed 0.1 mb/d of growth  in CY 2016.
Decline in non-OPEC production has been led by  the US where supply fell by 0.5 mb/d.
Supply growth from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq was 1.4 mb/d in  CY 2016.
Russian production also increased by 0.3 mb/d in   CY 2016.
Production from Nigeria fell by 0.3 mb/d due to  frequent disruption from militant attacks.
HIGHER INVENTORY CAPPED PRICES Brent crude oil prices averaged US$48.6/bbl in FY 2016-17,  marginally higher than US$47.5/bbl in FY 2015-16.
Oil prices  rose in H1 CY 2016 on lower production due to Canadian  wildfires and disruptions in Nigeria.
The production cut by OPEC  and some non-OPEC members in Q1 CY 2017 had little impact  on OECD crude and product inventories.
These higher inventory  levels and also additional supplies have capped the upside on  crude oil prices.
Further, the higher production outlook for US  shale oil has been acting to undermine efforts to tighten the  crude markets.
BENCHMARK REFINING MARGINS MODERATED ON  LOWER LIGHT DISTILLATE CRACKS Strong refining margins in early CY 2015 enticed refiners  globally to run at a higher utilisation as well as maximise  gasoline production in early 2016 too.
Global refinery utilisation  at 83.5% in 2016 was flat y-o-y albeit higher than the 5 year  average of 82.6%.
This sustained utilisation driven supplies with  relatively lower demand growth and inventory build-up during  the year moderated refining margins from exceptional highs in  the previous year.
LIGHT DISTILLATES Light distillate cracks receded from the record high reached  in FY 2015-16.
Gasoline demand contributed around 40%  of global oil demand growth, with the US, China and India  contributing 60% to the global gasoline demand growth.
US gasoline demand was strong in CY 2016 with 3% increase in  passenger miles travelled, supported by improving passenger  car sales.
Total car sales in China grew by ~14% in CY 2016 despite higher  taxes and higher fuel and credit costs.
SUV sales registered  strong growth throughout the year, at an average rate of 44%  contributing to the higher gasoline demand growth.
However, post higher gasoline margins in early 2015, refiners  maximised gasoline production leading to higher gasoline  supply in the later part of CY 2015 as well as in CY 2016.
Gasoline stocks in the US, the world’s largest gasoline market,  were at a 5 year high for the most part of CY 2016 capping  gasoline cracks globally.
Demand for naphtha from petrochemical sector remained firm  due to stable end product demand and favorable naphtha  Management’ s   Discussion and Analysis 67 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION cracking economics with narrower spread between Naphtha  and LPG.
However, gasoline-naphtha spread was lower y-o-y  reducing the gains from naphtha blending into gasoline.
MIDDLE DISTILLATES Middle distillate cracks marginally weakened in FY 2016-17 over  the previous year.
Globally the demand growth for diesel was  relatively subdued despite moderate economic growth.
Diesel  demand in China contracted for the first time since 2009 on  economic slowdown.
India’s diesel demand grew at a slower  pace of 1.8% during the year.
Jet fuel demand growth was aided by robust 7% growth  in global international passenger traffic and 6% growth in  domestic air travel.
Indian domestic aviation is a bright spot in  the global aviation market with growth of 22% y-o-y (Revenue  Passenger Kilometers) in FY 2016-17.
Jet fuel supply grew  during the year as compared to a decline in global gasoil supply  indicating that refiners took advantage of the better regrade  (jet fuel – gasoil differential).
FUEL OIL Fuel oil demand grew y-o-y for the first time in the last 10  years on strong bunker fuel demand with pick-up in shipping  activities.
Fuel oil supply, however was tighter due to lower  utilisation at Latin American refineries.
Exports from Russia  also reduced due to addition of secondary processing units  and adverse tax measures for fuel oil exports, which added  to the deficit.
Fuel oil cracks also strengthened with the OPEC  oil output cut which is targeted mainly towards medium and  heavy crude grades.
DEMAND GROWTH TO CONTINUE Global oil demand growth is expected to average 1.3 mb/d in  CY 2017 slowing down from the relatively high growth rates  seen at 2.0 mb/d in CY 2015 and 1.6 mb/d in CY 2016.
Increased  shale oil production in US is expected to provide additional  supplies.
Gasoline demand growth is expected to remain  supported in the current low oil price scenario.
Gasoil demand  is expected to firm up on better global economic outlook.
Refining capacity additions are expected to lag global product  demand growth for major part of CY 2017, supporting high  refinery utilisation and product cracks.
ILLUSTRATION:  New Distribution Model for Lubes   Business (Relstar) Despite having a retail outlet network and almost a decade  long market presence, it was difficult to attract quality channel  partners due to low sales volumes.
As a consequence, overall  Lubes volumes had stagnated for the last few years.
Action Taken: RIL worked with an interested party to create  a centralised Super Distributor for the Northern region.
The  team worked together to design operating model, draft the  processes and execute the entire on-boarding in record time.
Outcome: Compared to erstwhile high of 40 kilo litre, new  channel partner has already clocked over 100 KL every month  reaching March exit volumes of 125 KL.
This has not only  provided the much needed boost in Lubes volumes, but has  also helped in receiving multiple enquiries from the market for  building similar channel setup in other parts of the country.

KG D6 gas production declined by 27% for the year to 101.1  BCF.
Fall in production was mainly due to natural decline in the  fields coupled with sand and water ingress.
During the year,  considerable efforts were put in to sustain well offtake points  in D1D3 field to support production sustenance until next  wave of projects and recovery maximisation.
Additionally, RIL  commissioned two additional offtake points in D26 (MA) post  successful completion of side track activity.
KG-D6 operations  achieved field uptime of 100% which continues to be the global  benchmark for deep water facilities.
Panna-Mukta field produced 6.2 million barrel of crude, a  reduction of 10% on y-o-y basis and 62.5 BCF of natural gas, a  reduction of 9% on y-o-y basis.
The fall in production is owing  to natural decline in the field, shut in of wells due to integrity  issues and unplanned shutdown on wellhead platforms for riser  remedial work.
Despite multiple asset integrity issues, the major  gains in production were achieved due to better and sustained  production from MA & MB wells, better production optimisation  and sustained production from work-over wells.
ILLUSTRATION:  Production Performance Sustenance Decline in gas production rate due to decline in reservoir  pressure and increased production of water.
Action Taken: The high pressure gas available at surface, is  partially injected in subsea network (>600m water depth), on  continuous basis, at optimal rate.
Outcome: Sustaining the production level even in late life  operation of the field.
OUTLOOK: KG-D6   In the near term, RIL ’s focus is to maintain wells flowing in  its KG-D6 block.
This involves continuous field management  optimisation to sustain well count and manage network.
RIL  will continue to minimise operating cost without compromising  reliability and sustainability of field operations.
As part of the  early monetisation of existing discovered resources in KG D6  Block, efforts are underway to leverage the deflation in markets  for optimising capex for future development.
The contracting  process is underway for R-Cluster development with optionality  for use in MJ and Satellite development.
RIL ’s focus is to obtain  approvals for the development of projects.
RIL aims to sustain  production until future projects are commissioned, while  leveraging current market downturn to achieve lowest cost for  future projects.
ILLUSTRATION:  To keep wells flowing through  enhanced subsea network performance Increased liquid hold up in subsea network due to natural  decline in reservoir pressure which lead to production decline  & early wells ceasure.
Action Taken: Injecting surfactant (a type of foaming agent)  to reduce density of the fluid column in the subsea network  which helped to unload the liquid between flow systems and  resulted in reducing backpressure on the flowing wells and  thereby allowing well fluid to flow to surface facilities.
Outcome: Effective handling of flow assurance challenges  in subsea network there by achieving increased well life and  sustaining production during the late life of field.
PANNA-MUKTA  Panna-Mukta is a major contributor to the RIL ’s upstream  business.
The PSC for this block is scheduled to expire in  December 2019.

CBM (SOHAGPUR EAST AND SOHAGPUR WEST) RIL ’s CBM project is country’s first large-scale unconventional  natural gas project.
The scale of the project brings its own  set of execution challenges, primary among them are lack of  infrastructure and challenging terrain.
RIL has completed Phase 1 of the project which included  drilling and completion of more than 200 wells (spread over  450 sq.
km.).
Phase 1 required setting up of 2 gas gathering  stations along with 8 water gathering stations for collection  and processing of CBM Gas and water respectively.
RIL has  laid India’s largest High Density Poly Ethylene gas gathering  network to connect these wells with the gathering stations.
RIL ’s  CBM project is probably the largest surface footprint project in  E&P sector in India.
RIL has commenced commercial production from its Coal Bed  Methane (CBM) block SP (West)–CBM–2001/1 in March 2017  and is currently supplying CBM for commissioning the Shahdol  Phulpur Pipeline.
The production from RIL ’s Sohagpur CBM fields  will gradually ramp-up in next 15-18 months making RIL as one  of the largest unconventional natural gas producer in India.
ILLUSTRATION:  Optimisation of Artificial lift system,  used for water lifting in Coal Bed Methane (CBM)  wells To develop capability in artificial lift system to cater to varying  water lifting requirements at different life stages of a CBM well.
Action Taken: By utilising a dynamic pump software, a  balance between pulley size and motor capacity of artificial lift  system was worked out which determined the optimal pulley  ratio for different life stages of CBM well.
After verification  of the compatibility of the pulley with the motor hub of the  individual pump system, smaller sizes of pulleys have been  stocked.
The smaller sized pulley shall be used in later stage  of the life of a well when dewatering requirement gradually  decreases.
Outcome: Reduction in inventory of different capacities of  Artificial Lift system.

CY 2016 prices were at  lowest levels in a decade; which coupled with higher price  differentials resulted in weak realisations across the industry.
The Industry responded effectively with remarkable cuts in  capital spending and leveraged weak services markets.
Prices  recovered only during second half of the year for both oil  and the gas.
In the local markets of Texas region, gas and oil  differentials were low leading to better price realisation, but in  the North East US market, gas basis differentials remained high  due to midstream constraints.
Expansion of pipeline capacity in  the region has been slower than anticipated.
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE The Company effectively dealt with macro headwinds.
Development activity was slowed down and capex needs were  kept at minimum levels.
Focus was on conserving cash, without  losing optionality on resources.
Further, relentless focus was  given on improving operational efficiencies and reducing costs,  by leveraging weak market conditions.
This was supplemented  with variable production strategy in Marcellus JVs towards  safeguarding returns in low price environment.
Zero drilling strategy was continued at Carrizo JV and at the  Chevron JV.
Activity at the Pioneer JV was brought down from  5 rigs at the start of the year to zero rig operations by end of  Q1 CY 2016.
The forced “no rig activity” during CY 2016 allowed  JV partners and RIL to spend considerable effort to optimise  forward development plans that will be implemented starting  in 2017.
Significant progress was made in pad optimisation  with Chevron and in improving well designs with Pioneer.
Operational trends remained strong across JVs, with improving  costs and declining Capex.
Reliance’s aggregate capital  Reliance Industries Limited  Life is Beautiful.
Life is Digital.
86 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 investments across JVs stood at around US$200 MM during   CY 2016, reflecting a fall of 78% y-o-y.
Outlook for CY 2017 is more constructive compared to CY 2016.
Industry fundamentals have improved as characterised by  better demand supply conditions (also helped by OPEC  slow down).
This should augur well for prices going forward.
The Company is, however, taking a cautious approach to  development ramp-up and remains focused on conserving  cash and retaining optionality.
Reliance is pursuing reduced  activity levels even in CY 2017.
Zero rigs are in operation across  Marcellus JVs, but is ensuring preparedness for ramp up when  market conditions improve.
At the Pioneer JV, partners are  focused on pilot testing new development approach.
Thrust  remains on preserving long-term value through high-grading  of development and land portfolio, well cost reduction,  optimisation of well spacing and completions for enhanced  recoveries.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The joint ventures drilled 26 wells and put 42 wells on  production, taking cumulative number of producing wells to  1,088 by the end of CY 2016.
Drilling and completion activities  were completely stopped in Pioneer JV at the end of Q1 CY 2016.
At Chevron JV, there was no drilling activity, but the JV completed  Drilled Uncompleted (“DUC”) wells.
Gross JV production aggregated at ~1.07 BCFe/d for all 3 JVs,  down 15% y-o-y.
Reliance’s share of production and sales were  at 174.0 BCFe and 150 BCFe respectively in CY 2016, compared  to 203.8 BCFe and 171 BCFe in CY 2015.
This decline in volumes  was largely due to slowdown in development activities adopted  across JVs in view of challenging market conditions.
As the  Marcellus JV implemented variable production strategy for  curtailing production to prevent uneconomic realisation, it also  had an impact on volumes during the year.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Financial performance of the Shale Gas business was impacted  by strong macro headwinds.
WTI oil prices averaged 11%  lower at US$43.3/bbl in CY 2016 while HH Gas prices averaged  8% lower at US$2.46/MMbtu during this period.
Also, Gas  and condensate Benchmark differentials remained high  further impacting realisation.
Despite Reliance implementing  mitigating measure like proactive hedging while also focusing  on export of Condensates that offer superior netbacks, the  impact of weak prices was offset only partially.
For the full  year CY 2016, the realised price was US$2.43/Mcfe which was  19% lower than the average levels in 2015 there by impacting  revenues, earnings and cash flows.
Average unit realisation,  observed declining trend during H1 CY16, however with  prices recovering during Q4CY16, realisations were as high as  US$2.85/Mcfe during Q4 CY16 vs. US$2.42/Mcfe in Q4 CY 2015.
Operational efficiencies and Opex trends remained encouraging  across JVs.
Tight control over costs and improvement in  efficiencies helped achieve sequential improvement in lease  operating costs and overheads.
Absolute opex were lower by  over 7% across JVs, but could offset the impact of lower prices  only to some extent.
Consequently, EBITDA of Shale gas assets  dropped by over 61% y-o-y to US$117 million in CY 2016,  reflecting lower realisation and volumes.
PIONEER JV The Eagle Ford Shale JV with Pioneer faced significant  challenges during 2016.
Both production and realisations were  down.
Due to downward trend in WTI, JV stopped all drilling and  Completion activities by Q1 CY 2016.
However during early  2016 JV pursued various cost reduction and efficiency  improvement initiatives which included renegotiating services  contracts which brought down the drilling and completions  cost substantially.
Time off from Drilling and completion  activities was effectively utilised to analyse performance of  producing wells closely and identify areas of improvement.
Learnings from this analysis is being utilised in optimising  forward development strategy for 2017.
Pilot testing of new  well designs and spacing is planned in 2017 with 1 rig being  mobilised end of Q1 CY 2017.
Thrust on further reducing well  costs continues.
JV put only 18 wells online during CY 2016, thus the Producing  well count to 630 at the year-end, as compared to 612 well at  the end of CY 2015.
Gross JV production was 29% down 181  Bcfe compared to 256 Bcfe in CY 2015, while Reliance share  of net sales volume was 24% down at 72.9 Bcfe, compared to  96.5 Bcfe in CY 2015.
Production and sales volumes declined  on account of sharply lower development activity and natural  production decline.
However, the share of liquids improved  slightly from 64.6% to 65.2% in CY 2016, as the JV decided to  restart ethane extraction from the Natural Gas Liquid (NGL)  stream on account of improved price realisation.
Ethane  extraction helped in recovering loss due to lower prices realised  for gas to some extent.
CHEVRON JV  JV pursued Zero Rig strategy in CY 2016 while it focused  on completing some DUC wells.
Remarkable reduction in  operating costs and average well costs were key achievements  during the year.
JV delivered remarkable reduction reflecting  increased execution efficiency on pads, water transportation  and procurement gains.
Thrust was on optimising forward  development through pad optimisation and land portfolio  optimisation efforts.

Gross JV  production remained stable at 166 BCFe, despite slowdown in  activity which is reflective of improved operational efficiency  and strong well performance.
Reliance share of Net Sales  volume stood at 56.7 BCFe, compared to 56.5 BCFe in CY 2015.
JV is pursuing zero rig development while working towards  1st quartile on various performance parameters for 2017 and  making well inventory robust and economical at lower gas  prices.
CARRIZO JV In view of the prevailing challenging price environment in  the North East region, the Carrizo JV had decided to defer  development activities and stay focused on optimising  production from existing wells in the Northeastern  Pennsylvania region in 2015/2016.
Hence the JV continued to  pursue ‘zero development’ and ‘variable production’ strategy.
JV managed volumes as a function of price/netback by shut-in  of wells in low price scenarios, while maintaining well integrity.
However, during 2016 overall curtailment of production was  lower than that in 2015 as realisations improved towards 2nd  half of CY 2016.
This was reflected in higher volumes achieved  in Carrizo during CY 2016 as compared to 2015.
Gross JV production of 43 BCFe was 16% higher y-o-y, while  Reliance share of net sales at 21 BCFe, reflected a 13% growth  y-o-y.
Initial development activities in the Northeastern Pennsylvania  (NEPA) region have matured and infill drilling in the NEPA  region and potential development of acreages in the C-counties  provides opportunity for future growth.
UPDATE ON ARBITRATION AND OTHER  LEGAL ISSUES DOMESTIC GAS PRICING ARBITRATION Following the continued delay on the part of the Government  of India in notifying the gas price for the block KG-DWN-98/3  (‘KG D6 Block’) in accordance with the formula Government had  approved, RIL, BP and NIKO issued a Notice of Arbitration on  9th May, 2014 to the Government of India, seeking declaration  that the Contractor has the right to sell gas produced from KG  D6 Block at approved competitively determined, arm’s length  prices, and that the Government approved the price under the  ‘Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014’ notified on 10th  January, 2014, in terms of the Production Sharing Contract  (‘PSC’).
On 18th October, 2014, in supersession of its earlier notification  of 10th January, 2014, the Government notified the New  Domestic Natural Gas Price Guidelines 2014.
In RIL ’s view, the  methodology used for valuation of gas under these guidelines,  does not reflect true arms-length market price of gas in India as  required under the PSC signed with the Government.
RIL, BP and Niko have filed an application for appointment of  the presiding arbitrator before the Supreme Court of India and  the same is presently pending consideration.
KG D6 COST RECOVERY ARBITRATION RIL sought Government’s confirmation that no action was  being planned following news reports that the Government  may curtail the Company’s entitlement to recover its costs on  the basis of there being a shortfall in production from levels  specified in the development plan.
According to the Company,  the PSC for KG D6 Block permits full ‘cost recovery’ of its costs  of exploration, development and production from the value of  petroleum produced from the KG D6 Block.
RIL on behalf of all Contractor constituents – BP and Niko  served an arbitration notice on the Government on 23rd  November, 2011 (‘Cost Recovery Arbitration‘).
Parties have filed  their respective pleadings before the Arbitral Tribunal and are  in the process of completing the arbitration proceedings.
PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATIONS Three public interest litigations have been filed before the  Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the Company in relation  to the production sharing contract for KG D6 Block seeking  substantially similar reliefs in the nature of; (i) disallowance  of cost recovery; (ii) quashing the Government’s decision to  approve the certain gas price formula, and (iii) termination  of PSC for KG D6 Block for Contractor’s failure to achieve the  committed production.
The Company has submitted that the  underlying issues in the PILs are already subject matter of Cost  Recovery Arbitration and the Gas Price Arbitration.
Petitioner in  one of the PILs has recently filed an application for amendment  of the petition, which is yet to be heard by the court.
PMT ARBITRATION In December 2010, the Company and BG Exploration and  Production India Limited (together, the ’Claimants‘) referred a  number of disputes, differences and claims arising under two  Production Sharing Contracts entered into in 1994 among the  Claimants, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONCG)  and the Government (the ’PSCs‘) to arbitration.
The disputes  relate to, among other things, the limits of cost recovery, profit  sharing and audit and accounting provisions of the PSCs.
The  Government’s defense dated 31st January, 2012 raised certain  jurisdictional objections and asserted a number of substantial  counterclaims, including claims for underpayment of profits  and failure to complete agreed work programmes.
Following an  initial merits hearing in May 2012, the Tribunal passed a number  of final partial awards, largely in the Claimants’ favour.
Thereafter, the Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award  (“FPA”), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter  Reliance Industries Limited  Life is Beautiful.

Claimants have challenged certain parts  of the FPA before the English Courts and the English court has  initiated steps to effect service of the Challenge proceedings  upon the Government.
Once award on merits becomes final and absolute, Parties  will be heard by the Tribunal on the Cost Recovery Limit (CRL)  increase request of the Claimants and quantum.
Given the  complexity of issues involved, the hearings on CRL increase  and quantum are expected to take a few months to be heard  leading to a final arbitral award on adjustments required to the  Cost and Profit Petroleum due to the Parties.
YEMEN ARBITRATION Considering the deteriorating security situation in Yemen,  consortium of Reliance Exploration & Production DMCC  (“Reliance”) and Hood Energy Limited (“Hood”) declared  Force Majeure thereby suspending its obligations under the  Production Sharing Agreements (“PSAs”) for the Yemen blocks  34 and 37 and subsequently terminated the PSAs on account of  continued Force Majeure.
Yemen Government issued demands  under the Letters of Credit (“LCs”) established pursuant to the  terms of the PSAs on account of alleged non-performance  of PSA obligation.
Reliance and Hood initiated Arbitration  proceedings against Yemen Government under the terms of the  PSAs and the arbitration hearings have been concluded in 2016  and the Parties are presently awaiting Tribunal’s award.
DISPUTE WITH NTPC NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for  supply of natural gas by RIL.
The main issue in dispute is whether  a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the  parties for supply of Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for  a period of 17 years.
Cross examination of NTPC’s witness has  been completed and RIL ’s fact witnesses is to be cross examined  by NTPC.
GAS MIGRATION ARBITRATION ONGC filed a Writ Petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court  alleging that RIL, through wells located in proximity to the border  of KGD6, has extracted gas from ONGC operated blocks KG DWN  98/2 (KGD5) and G4 PML.
RIL and ONGC, in consultation with  Director General of Hydrocarbons, appointed DeGolyer and  MacNaughton (D&M) as an independent expert to ascertain  whether there has been migration of gas across RIL and ONGC  blocks.
The Writ Petition was disposed of with a Direction to the  Parties to cooperate with D&M in preparing its report and the  Government to take decision (if any) on the said report.
Following  submission of its report by D&M, Government of India appointed  a one man committee headed by Mr. Justice (Retd) AP Shah to  examine the D&M report and make recommendations.
Following  the issue of the Shah Committee’s report, Government sent a  Notice dated 4 November 2016 to the Contractor entities of Block  KG-D6 demanding remittance of US$ 1.55 bn purportedly on  account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks, to be paid  within 30 days.
RIL, on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor  for Block KG-D6, filed a Notice of Arbitration on 11 November  2016 and the arbitration proceedings are presently underway.

PREVENTING SOIL CONTAMINATION RIL ensures responsible disposal of waste generated by  partnering with various agencies to encourage end-of-life  recycling and reuse.
The Environment policy at RIL encourages  the manufacturing divisions to take appropriate measures to  prevent environmental incidences and maximise recycle to  reduce waste generated and disposed.
The waste generated is converted into a useful ‘bio-manure’ by  vermi-composting method, thereby reducing the load of waste  disposal.
The wastewater generated from the manufacturing  plants is treated and used for green-belt development, thereby  minimising effluent discharge.
Reliance has implemented the catalytic hydrothermal  liquefaction technology to convert waste plastics, such as HDPE,  PP , PBR, SBR and natural rubber to crude oil equivalent.
This has  resulted in reduction of waste generation from the process.
Reliance undertakes adequate measures to prevent spills  during handling and transportation of materials.
The Company  monitors spills at all its manufacturing divisions through an  online incident reporting system.
Additionally, it has a robust  system to prevent operational spills.
There has not been any  major accident giving rise to significant spills at Reliance’s  facilities since its inception.
ILLUSTRATION:  Creating value out of waste Certain waste generated from the operations goes for  disposal through authorised vendors through reprocessing,  incineration or landfill.
Action Taken: RIL collaborated with cement industries to  utilise waste as a fuel in the cement manufacturing process.
Outcome: Reduced consumption of non-renewable energy,  financial saving, emission reduction and waste minimisation.

In FY 2016-17,  a site specific Biodiversity Assessment study was completed at  Hazira Manufacturing Division.
To promote biodiversity, more than 1.38 crore saplings have  been planted across all RIL sites and other intervention areas till  date.
RIL has also added 5,129 acres of green belt, a contribution  from all manufacturing divisions since inception.
Through a unique partnership with Ministry of Environment  and Forests, Government of India and Gujarat Ecological  Commission, RIL is involved in setting up the National Centre for  Marine Biodiversity (NCMB) - India's first Centre of Excellence for  the study of India's coastal biodiversity at Jamnagar.
DILIGENT USAGE OF SCARCE RESOURCES In order to increase material efficiency, RIL has taken various  measures such as converting waste to organic manure and  biogas generation, recycling of used oil, slop oil and oily   sludge, recycling of waste PET bottles in its operations and  spent catalysts through authorised re-processors.
RIL ’s refineries have continued to remain in top quartile  performance based on Solomon’s energy intensity index.
Key strengths as per Solomon study are energy efficiency,  operational availability and utilised processing complexity.
Operational availability is defined as the percentage of time,  a unit or facility available to operate in its intended manner.
Higher Utilised Processing Complexity (UPC) generally  increases Gross Refining Margin (GRM).
With the completion of  Gasification plant, Paraxylene plant, ROGC plant and associated  units, Reliance’s Jamnagar will be among the highest conversion  refineries globally, with no ‘bottom-of-the-barrel’ products.

154 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 1.
INTRODUCTION   Reliance actively stimulates entrepreneurship throughout  the organisation and encourages its people to identify and  seize opportunities.
The current economic environment  in combination with significant growth ambitions of the  Reliance Group carries with it an evolving set of risks.
Reliance recognises that these risks need to be managed  to protect its customers, employees, shareholders and  other stakeholders in the society to achieve its business  objectives and enable sustainable growth.
Risk and  opportunity management is therefore a key element of the  overall Reliance strategy.
This section provides Reliance's  view on risk and the key risk factors for Reliance as well  as how it manages risk through its risk management  framework.
2.
RELIANCE’S VIEW ON RISK  2.1 Risk Appetite    Reliance’s risk appetite is linked to its strategic  approach and is based on the stance it has taken  across four areas:     Strategic and Commercial: Reliance manages  strategic risk in the pursuit of profitable growth  in both mature and emerging markets.
Given the  volatile markets and economic climate in which it  operates, the adaptability of its people, its service  offerings and its infrastructure are key.
Safety and Operations: Reliance is committed to  conduct all its activities in a manner appropriate  to avoid harm to employees and the community.
Reliance strives to deliver safe, reliable and  compliant operations.
Compliance and Control: Compliance with laws  and regulations is fundamental to maintaining its  license to operate in the various industries that it  operates in.
Reliance also believes that accurate  and reliable information provides a competitive  advantage and is key to effective management of  its business.
It therefore accepts minimal risk in  relation to reporting risks.
Financial: Reliance manages financial risk to  maintain a prudent financing strategy, even when  undertaking major investments and therefore  taking controlled risks in this area.
In Reliance, risk appetite is formally articulated through  specific policies related to common risks, business  decisions or activities.
For example, policies such as  financing and deal limits, vendor selection criteria, HSE,  customer credit and new country entry describe the level  of risk Reliance is willing to take including the specific  tolerances, limits and other boundaries within which  decisions shall be taken or activities shall be carried  out.
These policies are then enforced through controls  integrated in it's business processes and its governance  architecture.
2.2 Risk Factors    Reliance emphasises risks that threaten the  achievement of the Group’s business objectives  over the short to medium-term.
As part of its annual  planning process, Reliance reviews plan related risks,  opportunities and uncertainties.
It identifies those as  having a high priority for particular oversight by the  Board and its various committees and by Executive  Committees.
An overview of these risks is provided  hereafter, including the actions taken to mitigate these  risks and any related opportunities:  I.
Strategic and commercial risks   A.
Commodity Prices and markets     Reliance’s financial performance is subject to  the fluctuating prices of crude oil and gas and  downstream petroleum products.
Prices of oil  and gas products are affected by supply and  demand, both globally and regionally.
Factors that  influence fluctuations in crude prices and crude  availability include operational issues, natural  disasters, political instability, economic conditions  and Government pricing policy of petroleum  products among others.
Mitigation: Since Reliance operates an integrated  hydrocarbon business, some of these risks can  be offset by gains in other parts of the Group.
To mitigate the risks resulting from non- availability of crude and feedstock, Reliance has a  diversified crude sourcing strategy from multiple  geographies (Asia, the Middle East, West Africa,  Latin/South America and North Africa) under  both short-term and long-term arrangements.
In  addition, Reliance has put in place commodity  risk management policies which provide the  framework for decision making with respect to  exposures from commodity trading positions.
Changes since last year: There have been no  significant changes in the nature of the risk  exposures over the last 12 months.
B.
Major Project Execution Risk     Reliance’s future growth plans depend upon  successful delivery of major capital projects to  deliver its long-term strategic objectives   related to: Management’ s   Discussion and Analysis 155 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION    1.
Reducing energy costs and boost profit  margins;    2.
Gasification of Petroleum Coke which will  utilise low value refinery streams;    3.
Utilising refinery off-gases to produce  polymers and polyesters and    4.
Expanding into speciality elastomers.
The construction phase for most units in  Jamnagar are nearing completion and are  under various phases of pre-commissioning and  commissioning.
The non-Jamnagar projects are  also in the process of getting commissioned in  the coming months.
Managing the risks related  to the delivery of these and other major capital  projects is key to enhancing Reliance’s long-term  shareholder value.
Mitigation: Project risk management is  embedded in the way Reliance delivers projects.
All Project teams are comprised of experienced  project management professionals.
Risk  Management is diligently carried out within  Projects.
During the project phase various  risks have been identified and they have been  mitigated through periodic risk assessments,  proactive planning and monitoring and  meticulous execution of planned activities.
Currently the residual risks are mostly related to  commissioning and safety related risks due to  simultaneous working of several agencies.
These  risks are getting mitigated by conducting ongoing  trials on machinery and systems prior to start of  Operations and by having a coordinated safety  management programme amongst the various  agencies.
Changes since last year: In Manufacturing,  major Jamnagar expansion and other projects  are drawing to a close in the coming months.
As  a result the risks are shifting from construction  risks to exposures related to commissioning and  start-up which are being handled through testing,  trial runs and conducting comprehensive training  of the staff.
Major project execution risks related to building  the 4G infrastructure in Jio have diminished  significantly since the successful launch of the 4G  LTE TDD high speed wireless internet and mobile  communication services.
C. Customer Experience and Retention:     Reliance Jio now has more than 100 million  customers following an innovative customer  acquisition strategy.
Jio is committed to deliver  on a differentiated customer experience and  its constant endeavor is to proactively mitigate  any such risks that may weaken Jio’s value  propositions, brand and customer loyalty.
To deliver this, along with expansion of its  current customer base; customer experience and  retention are of utmost importance for Jio to  generate sustainable business performance and  return on its investments.
Mitigations: To successfully capitalise on Pan- India rollout of an all IP LTE network to deliver  next generation digital services  and for ensuring  sustained customer value proposition, Jio’s  strategic and risk framework encapsulates the  following mitigations/plans:    1.
Leverage Jio’s Pan-India network foot print  and digital ecosystem to expand Jio’s product  offerings to diversify revenue sources and  customer base.
2.
Ongoing investments in spectrum and  network infrastructure for over 95%  population coverage and superior customer  experience delivery.
3.
Jio Prime Membership Programme for  founder members: A loyalty programme that  assures not only most competitive monthly  tariff plans in the industry, but also many  other attractive deals and offers from Jio and  its partners to ensure retention and loyalty.
4.
To ensure that Jio’s existing and prospective  customers do not ever suffer from ‘data  anxiety’ and remain assured of the best value  for the price paid in a hyper competitive  market, Jio is introducing ‘Everyday More  Value Offer’ .
In this offer customers are  assured of 20% more data at similar or  better pricing than what the leading Indian  operators provide.
Changes since last year: Jio has commenced  services from September, 2016 and is  progressively expanding its network for full  population coverage.
II.
Safety and operational risks   A.
Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Risks in  Operations     Reliance is exposed to a wide spectrum of HSE  Reliance Industries Limited  Life is Beautiful.
Life is Digital.
156 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 risks, given the diversity and complexity of  the industries, it operates in.
The exploration  and production of oil and gas and their further  refining and processing is regulated by various  HSE related regulations across the geographies  where Reliance operates.
A major HSE incident,  such as fire, oil spill, security breach can result in  loss of life, environmental degradation and overall  disruption in business activities.
Mitigation: The Reliance HSE policy requires  that ‘Safety of persons overrides all production  targets’ .
This ensures that all employees strive for  excellence in their own personal safety and the  safety of others including employees, contractors,  customers and the communities within which  Reliance operates.
Reliance has set itself the goal  of ‘zero injuries and incidents‘ .
A separate Safety  and Operational Risk (S&OR) function provides  oversight on HSE exposures and periodically  conducts HSE assessments and reviews to  get assurance on the operation of the HSE  management framework protocols and regulatory  compliances.
Changes since last year: All manufacturing sites  have made significant progress with re-baselining  their risk assessments.
For the highest risks,  action plans have been defined and endorsed  by Executive Management involving capital  investments as well as enhancing administrative  and operational controls.
Reliance have also made good progress on the  implementation of its Integrated Operating  Management System (OMS).
This included the  implementation of more than 20 priority elements  that relate to Process, Safety and Reliability.
Conformance to these requirements will be  verified by a Site-independent auditor during  the next 6 months.
These initiatives contribute to  Operational and HSE Excellence.
B.
Marine Safety and Environmental Risks     Reliance is exposed to a complex and diverse  range of marine risk including: exploration  vessels, oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas tankers,  dry cargo vessels, operating ethane vessels,  operating chemical tankers, operating a large  fleet of tugs and port service vessels as well as  owning and operating a significant amount of  port and terminal infrastructure.
With 96% of all  crude being supplied to Reliance by vessel and  the overwhelming majority of refined products  being exported by vessel it is essential that  these activities are actively managed to avoid  HSE incidents, oil spills or disruption to business  activities and processes.
Mitigation: Reliance’s augmented ship vetting  programme will ensure that all vessels used  to carry Reliance cargoes or those that call  at a Reliance facility undergo an enhanced  risk assessment screening using state-of-the- art predictive risk software, as used by oil  super majors globally, to minimise the risk of  substandard vessels entering the marine value  chain.
Reliance has further increased its marine  contractor auditing programme to ensure  that terminal facilities, long-term charter  vessels, the owners of long term vessel charter  and contractors used in ship-to-ship transfer  management are reviewed for compliance against  Reliance and industry requirements.
Additionally  through having a marine technical authority  at Reliance marine risk understanding and  management is further improved.
The newly introduced ethane vessels are being  managed by world class specialist managers who  in turn are being monitored by a dedicated team  within Reliance to ensure safe, compliant and  successful operations.
Changes since last year: As Reliance is  introducing six very large ethane carriers  into service, a world first, the requirement  for enhanced marine risk management  understanding and appropriate controls   has grown.
C. Physical Security and Natural Calamity risks     Hostile acts such as terrorism or piracy could harm  the Company’s people and disrupt its operations.
Some of Reliance’s sites are also subject to natural  calamities such as floods, cyclones, lighting and  earthquakes.
If the company does not respond,  or is perceived to not respond, in an appropriate  manner to either an external or internal crisis,  its business and operations could be severely  disrupted.
Inability to restore or replace critical  capacity to the required level within an agreed  timeframe would prolong the impact of any  disruption and could severely affect Reliance’s  business and operations.
Mitigation: Reliance maintains a proactive  posture by continuously monitoring and assessing  emerging threats, vulnerabilities and risks to  manage its physical security.
The group security  Management’ s   Discussion and Analysis 157 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION function and embedded security teams provide  assurance to businesses at all levels with respect  to the management of security risks affecting its  people, assets and operations.
To respond to natural calamities Reliance  maintains disaster recovery, crisis and business  continuity management plans to respond to a  disruption or an incident.
Changes since last year: Risk of terrorism is  increasing globally as evidenced by intelligence  projections and events of last year.
Continuous  application of appropriate mitigation measures  are implemented to ensure exposures remain  within acceptable levels.
D.  Cybersecurity Risk     Reliance is at the forefront of adopting Technology  Led Innovations.
An increasing number of  business processes are now digitally driven.
The  larger the digital landscape, the larger is the  potential cyber security threat.
A digital security  breach or disruption to digital infrastructure,  due to intentional or unintentional actions, such  as cyber- attacks or human error could lead to  serious business impacts.
These include injury to  staff, loss of process control, impact on business  continuity or damage to assets and services, harm  to the environment, the loss of sensitive data or  information, legal and regulatory breaches and  reputational damage.
Mitigation: Reliance has continued to strengthen  its responses to cybersecurity threats through  proactive and reactive risk mitigations.
These  include, proactive activities to continuously  improve its cybersecurity policies, standards,  technical safeguard, ongoing monitoring of new  and existing threats and cyber security awareness  initiatives.
Its reactive responses to cybersecurity  threats, which include IT disaster recovery,  emergency response and business continuity  management capabilities to enable the reduction  of the impacts of a cybersecurity event.
Changes since last year: The World economic  Forum (WEF) in its latest Global Risk Report (2017)  has flagged “Massive incident of data fraud and  theft” as one of the top 5 global Risk in terms of  likelihood.
Considering the large digital landscape  in Reliance, the Cyber security risks are increasing  which require ongoing efforts to counter these  evolving threats.
Substantial improvement was  made on the cyber security risk posture during  the last year.
Some of the notable measures are:    1.
A Continuous Improvement Program (CIP) for  cyber security was instituted across Reliance,  to keep pace with ever increasing threats.
2.
Reliance regularly conducts Cyber Security  Awareness programs across the Group and  run many and ongoing user awareness  connect activities to make sure that each and  every user is aware of the basic cyber security  hygiene and their responsibilities.
3.
Several businesses of Reliance are now  benchmarked against ISO 27001, the global  standard for ISMS ( Information Security  Management System).
III.
Compliance and Control Risks   A.
Regulatory Compliance Risks     The evolution of the global regulatory  environment has resulted into increased  regulatory scrutiny that has raised the bar with  regards to regulatory compliance.
This signifies  the alignment between corporate performance  objectives, while ensuring compliance with  regulatory requirements.
Mitigation: Reliance recognises that meeting  all applicable regulatory requirements can be  challenging.
A comprehensive and digitally  enabled compliance management framework has  been deployed which is designed to:      Understand changes to regulatory standards  in a timely manner and assess their impact to  strengthen decision making processes and  integrate these in the business strategy of  each of the industries in which it operates;      Convergence of risk, compliance processes  and controls mechanisms to ensure  continued operational efficiency and  effectiveness of business processes;      Assign single point of accountability for  compliance activities in the organisation.
Changes since last year: There have been no  significant changes in the nature of the risk  exposures over the last 12 months.
Automation  of a comprehensive compliance management  framework has been key for this period and has  been successfully implemented across the Group  in India, resulting in better and transparent  controls related to regulatory compliances.

158 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS Integrated Annual Report 2016-17   B.
Indirect Tax Policy and Compliance Risks     Goods and Services tax (GST) has been identified  as one of the most important tax reforms post- independence.
The proposed GST levy will impact  processes and systems across Reliance's entire  value chain of operations, namely procurement,  manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, sales,  and pricing.
Furthermore, some of the most  significant impact relates to the (1) exclusion of  petroleum products and the uncertainty about  when it will be brought under the ambit of GST  and (2) interpretational issues in a number of new  provisions.
Mitigation: Reliance's mitigation measures  encompass the following strategies:    1.
Evaluating different scenarios related to the  design and application of GST in the various  businesses.
2.
Continually tracking policy development  regarding GST and update prepared  scenarios.
3.
Identification of any areas of adverse  impact and the preparation of contingency  measures.
4.
Identification of issues and concerns needing  representations to the authorities and  developing strategies for effective advocacy.
5.
A centrally managed project to ensure all  process and systems changes are fully tested  and integrated.
Changes since last year: New risk due to roll out  of GST in FY 2017-18.
IV.
Financial Risks   A.
Treasury Risks     Treasury risks include, among others, exposure to  movements in interest rates and foreign exchange  rates.
Reliance also maintains sufficient liquidity,  so that it is able to meet its financial commitments  on due dates and is not forced to obtain funds  at higher interest rates.
It has access to markets  worldwide and uses a range of products and  currencies to ensure that its funding is efficient  and well diversified across markets and investor  types.
Interest Rate Risk      Reliance borrows funds from domestic and  international markets to meet its long-term  and short-term funding requirements.
It is  subject to risks arising from fluctuations in  interest rates.
Mitigation: The interest rate risk is managed  through financial instruments available to convert  floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities or  vice versa, and is aimed at optimising the cost of  borrowings.
Foreign Exchange Risk      Reliance prepares its financial statements in  Indian Rupee (INR), but most of the payables  and receivables of hydrocarbon business are  in US Dollars, minimising the cash flow risk on  account of fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates.
Reliance avails long-term foreign  currency liabilities (primarily in USD, EURO  and JPY) to fund its capital investments.
Reliance also avails short-term foreign  currency liabilities to fund its working capital.
Mitigation: Foreign exchange risk is tracked and  managed within the risk management framework.
Short-term foreign currency asset – liability  mismatch is continuously monitored and hedged.
The foreign exchange market is well regulated  and Reliance ensures compliance with all the  regulations.
Changes since last year: There have been no  significant changes in the nature of the risk  exposures over the last 12 months.
Monitoring  mechanisms within the Treasury function have  been enhanced to further strengthen the control  framework.
3.
HOW RELIANCE MANAGES RISK   Reliance manages, monitors and reports on the principal  risks and uncertainties that can impact its ability to achieve  its strategic objectives.
The Company’s risk management  framework encompasses internal control in an integrated  manner and is tailored to the specific Reliance segments,  businesses and functions.
It takes into account various  factors such as the size and nature of the inherent risks  and the regulatory environment of the individual business  segment or operating company.
The Reliance management systems, organisational  structures, processes, standards, code of conduct and  values and behaviours together govern how Reliance  conducts its business and manages associated risks.
Reliance’s risk management framework is designed to be  a simple, consistent and clear framework for managing  and reporting risks from the Group’s operations to the  Board.
The framework and related processes seek to avoid  incidents and maximise business outcomes by allowing  management to: Management’ s   Discussion and Analysis 159 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION    Understand the risk environment and assess the  specific risks and potential exposure for Reliance.
Determine how to deal best with these risks to  manage overall potential exposure.
Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways.
Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness of  the management of these risks and intervene for  improvement where necessary.
Report up the management chain to the board on a  periodic basis about how risks are being managed,  monitored, assured and the improvements that are  being made.
3.1 Group Risk Management Framework    The Group Risk Management Framework is designed  to help ensure risk management is an integral part of  the way that Reliance works everywhere to enable risks  to be identified, assessed and managed appropriately.
The Group Risk Management Framework comprises  three levels:     Oversight and Governance - Reliance’s Board,  along with executive and functional leadership  have articulated an absolute commitment of the  Group to effective risk management and provides  oversight to identify and understand significant  risks.
They also put in place systems of risk  management, compliance and control to mitigate  these risks.
Dedicated Executive sub-committees  review and monitor group risks throughout the  year with the respective risk owners to drive a risk  management culture.
Business and Strategic Risk Management -  Through Business Risk and Assurance  Committees (BRAC), Reliance businesses and  functions manage risk as part of key business  processes such as strategy, planning, operations,  performance management, resource and capital  allocation and project appraisal.
The BRAC’s  do this by collating risk data, assessing risk  management activities, reviewing near misses and  incidents through root cause analysis followed by  implementation of required improvements.
Day-to-day Risk Management - Management and  staff at Reliance’s facilities, assets and functions  identify and manage risk, promoting safe,  compliant and reliable operations.
For example,  Reliance’s Group-wide Operating Management  System (OMS) integrates Reliance requirements  on health, safety, security, environment, social  responsibility, operational reliability and related  issues.
These Reliance requirements, along with  business needs and the applicable legal and  regulatory requirements, underpin the practical  plans developed to help reduce risk and deliver  strong, sustainable performance.
3.2  Continuous Assurance through the Three Lines  of Defense    Reliance has adopted a Three Lines of Defense model  to enable continuous and real time assurance on  key risk exposures and the ongoing effectiveness of  controls.
First Line of Defense: Business and Functional  Leaders continuously verify for themselves that risk  management activities they have in place are effective.
In conjunction with the risk management activities  themselves, this monitoring activity provides the first  line of defense.
Second Line of Defense: A network of functional  experts provide Functional Assurance to the  Businesses in their area of expertise by:   1.
Providing a view, independent of the line, of risks  within their area of functional expertise.
2.
Setting standards for the management of risks  and provide guidance on mitigations to relevant  Businesses in their area of expertise.
3.
Monitoring or verifying the effectiveness of  controls and other risk management activities  completed by the Business.
Third Line of Defense - Group Audit: Reliance has  established an independent Group Audit function,  reporting to the Chairman of the Board and the Audit  Committee.
The Group Audit function is mandated  to provide assurance and advisory support on the  management systems that manage the key group  risks across all subsidiaries and investments by the  Reliance Group.
Group Audit function is aligned to the  key business segments in order to deliver Group Wide  assurance coverage as part of the third line of defense.
The Group Audit function has been set up as a multi- disciplinary teams that deliver assurance across all  areas of risk including strategic & commercial, safety &  operational, compliance & control and financial risks  across all business segments.
Specialised resources,  real time assurance technologies, data mining,  analytic techniques and external benchmarking of  best practices are leveraged extensively to achieve  Group wide assurance coverage and deliver audits in  an efficient and effective manner.
The Group Audit  function operates in line with international auditing  standards and continuously improves its functional  capabilities to achieve world class assurance best  practices.

The developmental initiatives of Reliance have so far touched  the lives of more than 12 million people across India in  more than 12,500 villages and 74 urban locations.
This year,  Reliance has undertaken several significant interventions  aimed at improving lives of the marginal and underprivileged  communities.
The following sections provide details of the  Company's key initiatives undertaken in this year.
RURAL TRANSFORMA TION Reliance works towards bridging the developmental gap  between rural 'Bharat' and urban India by improving rural  livelihood, addressing poverty, hunger and malnutrition.
Key  initiatives in this area include supporting farm and non-farm  livelihoods.
Towards creating holistic self-reliant and sustainable  models of rural transformation, the organisation works to  improve productivity of the farm lands, ensuring water security  by water conservation and rain-water harvesting.
We help  rural communities in organising themselves to form Village  Associations (VA's) and producer companies.
In doing so,  technology is used as an enabler for delivering need based  information to improve the quality of life.
These initiatives  focus on improving food security, enhancing nutrition and  developing community infrastructure.
Since inception, the  programme has reached out to over 52,000 families across 500  villages.
INSTITUTION BUILDING Reliance works to establish its rural transformation model  in building community institutions that are based on values  of democracy, inclusiveness and transparency to achieve  holistic village development.
The primary outcome of the  engagement is an empowered and self-reliant community  based organisation with robust membership base and strong  leadership.
The uniqueness in design lies in the co-creation and  co-design of solutions contextualised as per social, economic  and ecological situations.
Till date, more than 52,000 rural  households have joined hands to form 529 Village Associations  to drive village transformation.
WATER SECURITY Under its rural transformation initiatives, Reliance has  contributed towards conserving rainwater in all its programme  villages.
Various harvesting structures including new and  renovated earthen check dams, masonry check dams,  farm ponds and open wells, temporary structures such as  boribandhan, tanks etc.
have been constructed.
Through these  structures, over 5.86 crore cubic metres of rain water has been  harvested since inception.
Through these initiatives, over  2,900 hectares of land has been brought under water efficient  irrigation system this year and over 23,500 hectares brought  under irrigation since inception.
Reliance Foundation used ferro-cement technology for  overcoming the challenges in construction of conventional  water storage tanks especially in the hilly terrain of Uttarakhand  where construction in itself was a challenge.
These tanks  reduce the cost of water storage by almost three-times.
Over  100 ferro-cement structures were constructed last year across  the villages.
As a result of these water security measures, 131  villages achieved drinking water security and 51 villages were  secured for irrigation.
For effective use of water resources, water  budgeting has been done in 354 villages.
586  lakh cubic metres of water storage capacity  created CUMULA TIVE RAIN WA TER HARVESTING   CAPACITIES CREA TED  FY 2016-17 549FY 2015-16 447FY 2014-15 244FY 2013-14 63FY 2012-13 586 (in lakh cubic metres) FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY Reliance has adopted integrated sustainable crop management  practices to enhance crop productivity and availability of  food grains in every household throughout the year.
At the  Report on Corporate Social  Responsibility 169 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION same time, Reliance ensured reduction in cost of production  to enhance farm incomes.
Till date, over 56,000 Ha of land has  been brought under sustainable agriculture with nearly 5,000  Ha of private wasted land brought under cultivation.
This has  ensured food security for over 20,000 households.
To improve nutritional food intake, Reliance has been setting  up nutrition gardens.
As on date nearly 8,000 Reliance Nutrition  Gardens (RNGs) have been developed.
Reliance’s RNG model  has been highly praised by various Government and   Non-Government organisations on different platforms.
Several organisations have adopted the Reliance model of  nutrition garden (RNG) and have scaled it up in their project  areas with technical support from the implementing team of  Reliance Foundation.
For instance, Government of Maharashtra  (GoM) has adopted the nutrition garden model to scale it up  in 8 districts.
Under this initiative, Reliance has trained 1,066  master trainers from various line departments on design, layout  and maintenance of RNG.
This has resulted in establishment of  3,035 nutrition gardens benefitting over 62,000 children across  these districts.
The content developed by Reliance on nutrition  garden is used in a newly developed application titled “WCD” in  the section of nutrition garden by Department of Women and  Child Development, GoM.
PRODUCER COMPANIES A significant downside for marginal farmers is the marketability  of farm produce.
Several challenges which influence the  marketing of agriculture produce such as smaller land holdings,  smaller volumes of produce make it a difficult and unviable  business proposition.
Risks such as climatic variability, monsoon  failure, price fluctuations and lack of market access negatively  impact the sustenance of farming as a primary occupation.
As  a sustainable solution for farm and non-farm livelihoods and  making agriculture a productive business, Reliance has been  supporting marginal and small farmers in establishing producer  companies.
Reliance works towards creating market linkages  of the products for better price realisation.
So far, 17 producer  companies have been established benefitting over 20,000  families.
These companies have transacted over 4,500 metric  tonnes of farm and non-farm produce, with a business turnover  of over `10 crore.
USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN ENHANCING  AGRICUL TURAL OUTPUT Reliance has been developing technological solutions for  improved agricultural productivity.
Technologies which  are lower in cost and could yield higher returns are being  introduced in rural areas for producing Azolla, a green manure  for paddy that has an immense potential to meet the growing  demand of fodder among small and marginal farmers.
Over  800 such farmers in Andhra Pradesh have benefitted from  these technologies.
Technologies like Banana bunch covers are  being used by farmers of banana plantations to protect fruits  from pests and birds, thus yielding a good market value with  increased returns.
Till date, Reliance has distributed over 50,000  banana covers to over 450 farmers.
This low cost technology is a  simple solution that can be replicated and scaled up.
50,000 Banana covers distributed to farmers ECOLOGICAL SECURITY This year, Reliance has conserved over 2,200 hectares of  unproductive land and converted it into cultivable land (more  than 56,000 hectares since inception).
More than 80% of this  land has been used for food production while rest of it has  been used for activities such as cultivation of fodder and other  commercial crops etc.
Furthermore, in an effort to promote  bio-diversity and preserve the ecology, over 12 lakh saplings  were planted this year (over 1.38 crore saplings planted since  inception).
1.38 crore saplings have been planted since  inception LAND BROUGHT UNDER IMPROVED CUL TIVA TION  FY 2016-17 53,934FY 2015-16 48,912FY 2014-15 31,010FY 2013-14 15,314FY 2012-13 56,139 (in hectare) In order to get high yield from cost effective farming, Reliance  has supported in conducting soil health activities such as  workshops, soil testing, application of nutrients etc.
This year,  essential nutrients were applied to about 797 hectares of  agricultural land.
Additionally, in collaboration with different  knowledge partners, over 3,500 soil health tests were  conducted this year (over 10,371 tests since inception) based on  which relevant advisories were disseminated at village level.

INFORMATION SERVICES FOR LIVELIHOOD  ENHANCEMENT Reliance is empowering communities by providing reliable and  robust information tailored to the local needs of farmers, fisher  folks and livestock owners.
This information is disseminated  through digital technology and direct community level  interventions.
The mobile based advisories have reached out  to about 8 lakh individuals this year.
Together, the technology  embedded information has reached out to about 28 lakh  individuals since inception.
As a part of direct interventions,  interactive programmes are being conducted at community  level on various issues such as health, agriculture, livelihood,  livestock etc.
This year, over 3,700 interactive programmes  (over 10,000 programmes since inception) were conducted  that reached out to over 1.4 lakh individuals (over 3.4 lakh  individuals since inception).
Reliance has been collaborating with like-minded organisations  including research institutions, line departments, NGOs and  knowledge providers.
So far, it has partnered with over 619  information providers and 284 grassroots organisations.
Through these partners, the information services reach out to  the most needy population subgroups.
28 lakh farmers, fisher folks and livestock owners    exposed to technology embedded  information ILLUSTRATION:  Information services protecting  fisher folks from adverse sea conditions Action Taken Fishermen who anchor their boats at  Mirkarwada Jetty near Ratnagiri received information about  bad weather conditions through Reliance’s voice message  advisories.
The forecast warned the fishermen to visit the sea  while they were on the verge of launching their boats.
The  forecast thus saved fisher folk’s boats, fishing nets and most of  all their lives.
Outcome The messages from Reliance reduced the  fishermen’s input cost such as diesel, ice etc.
and thus  increased the profit.
SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAN Since the launch of Government of India’s Swachh Bharat  Mission, Reliance has been conducting several activities to  improve health outcomes in its programme villages.
This  year, awareness campaigns were carried out through posters,  kalajathas and rallies in each of the programme villages to  sensitise them on the importance of toilet construction.
Additionally, using technological platform, people were also  informed about the procedures through teleconferencing  and toll free helplines to avail the benefits of schemes such  as Sardar Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana,  Vriddha Pension Yojana, Animal Loan Yojana etc.
The villages  are also collaborating with different Government schemes for  leveraging their fund to achieve the Open Defecation Free  (ODF) status.
As a result of these efforts, over 15,000 toilets have  been constructed in about 263 villages and 48 villages were  declared to be ODF by the Government.
15,000+ toilets were constructed across  263 villages to improve health and  sanitation 48 villages declared to be open   defecation free DEVELOPING MODEL VILLAGES Reliance will work in 53 villages of Parbhani and Yavatmal  districts of Maharashtra supporting the state government in  their quest for sustainable development in villages through  ‘Mission Village Transformation’ .
3,000 Thrift groups of women are formed to  enhance financial decision making ILLUSTRATION:  Empowering women on financial  management and decision making Action Taken Reliance is supporting rural women to form  thrift co-operatives for bringing social and economic freedom  through accumulation and retention of local wealth within  the village.
This model enables and engages women to  participate, drive and manage the socio-economic change  processes while being financially self-reliant and playing an  active role in decision making.
Outcome More than 3,000 women have formed 106 thrift  groups across 14 districts in 7 states, having saved and    collected over ` 22 lakh.
Report on Corporate Social  Responsibility 171 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION ILLUSTRATION:  Transition from a contract labourer  to a self-sustained farmer Action Taken Due to lack of irrigation facilities, Mr. Vitthal  had to work as a contract labourer despite owning 6 acres of  agricultural land.
Due to excessive dependence on rain, Vitthal  earned only `31,000 a year by cultivating toor, cotton and  soya bean.
In 2012, Reliance Foundation mobilised villagers to form  Bhumiputra Shetkari Samiti, the local village association  (VA).
The VA helped Vitthal with bunding, trenching, and the  application of black soil and farmyard manure on his land.
The  VA also built a water harvesting structure that provided access  to irrigation.
Outcome The productivity of Vitthal’s crops improved and  his farmlands thrived.
He started growing Rabi crops like  sorghum, wheat, spinach, fenugreek and pulses, in addition to  his usual Kharif crops.
Vitthal’s total annual income tripled.
ILLUSTRATION:  Empowering women to emerge as a  role model Action Taken Sujata Rout and her husband Dinabandhu  owned 7.55 acres of land of which only 4.07 acres was  utilised for cultivating paddy.
The income generated from  selling 49 quintals of paddy was not sufficient for feeding the  family.
In 2013, Reliance Foundation (RF) launched its Rural  Transformation programme in Sujata’s village, Kalijharan.
Attending the Village Association (VA) meetings, Sujata soon  found her voice and became an active participant.
The VA  helped Sujata rejuvenate her fields through different land  development activities, including land levelling and bunding.
With RF’s support, she also received training on professional  skills such as stitching and food processing, to increase her  income.
Outcome Through RF’s assistance, Sujata Rout used her  entrepreneurial ingenuity to generate multiple sources of  income for her family.
The produce of her farm shot up from  49 quintals of paddy to 89 quintals.
In the process, she has  emerged as a role model for women in her district.
Impact of Rural Transformation Initiatives   Enhanced income and livelihood of rural marginal and  small farmers   Increased employment opportunities   Ensuring sustainable agricultural production with  secured water needs Impact of Rural Transformation Initiatives   Improved food and nutrition security, and eradication of  hunger and malnutrition   Creating value chain for agricultural produce   Empowering women and ensuring gender equality in  village development processes   Improved health, hygiene and sanitation    Ensuring financial security for underprivileged women   Skill development for better employment opportunities    Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and  modern energy for all   Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for long-term  sustainable development   Improved quality of life HEAL TH Reliance addresses issues around affordability and accessibility  of quality healthcare and brings about improvement in  awareness and healthy living practices in various parts of India.
The focus is on improving primary, secondary and tertiary  healthcare facilities to enhance preventive and curative services.
Reliance also works on bringing about behavioural change for  improving maternal and child health.
Another key focus area is improving healthcare delivery  through innovative outreach programmes.
Reliance works in  the areas of communicable and non-communicable diseases  and uses technology for training, competency evaluation and  clinical decision support for medical professionals.
Through the  Drishti programme, the Company has supported a number of  visually impaired people with corneal transplant surgeries.
40 lakh health consultations were provided PREVENTIVE AND PRIMARY HEAL THCARE  SERVICES Reliance addresses health needs of the underprivileged through  its preventive and primary healthcare services in both rural  and urban areas.
The health services are made more accessible  through nine Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) and three Static  Medical Units (SMUs) in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Madhya  Pradesh.
This year, one more MMU has been launched in  Palghar district which will provide health services outreach in  11 villages to about 18,000 people.

196 Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE REPORT “Between my past, the present and  the future, there is one common  factor: Relationship and T rust.
This  is the foundation of our growth.” Founder Chairman   Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani In accordance with the provisions of the Securities and  Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure  Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing Regulations’), the  report containing the details of Corporate Governance systems  and processes at Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is as follows: At RIL, Corporate Governance is all about maintaining a valuable  relationship and trust with all stakeholders.
We consider  stakeholders as partners in our success, and we remain committed  to maximising stakeholders’ value, be it shareholders, employees,  suppliers, customers, investors, communities or policy makers.
This approach to value creation emanates from our belief that  sound governance system, based on relationship and trust, is  integral to creating enduring value for all.
We have a defined policy  framework for ethical conduct of businesses.
We believe that any  business conduct can be ethical only when it rests on the six core  values of Customer Value, Ownership Mindset, Respect, Integrity,  One Team and Excellence.
ST A TEMENT ON COMP ANY’S  PHILOSOPHY ON CODE OF  GOVERNANCE Corporate Governance encompasses a set of systems and  practices to ensure that the Company’s affairs are being managed  in a manner which ensures accountability, transparency and  fairness in all transactions in the widest sense.
The objective  is to meet stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations.
Good governance practices stem from the dynamic culture and  positive mindset of the organisation.
We are committed to meet  the aspirations of all our stakeholders.
This is demonstrated in  shareholder returns, high credit ratings, governance processes  and an entrepreneurial performance focused work environment.
Additionally, our customers have benefited from high quality  products delivered at extremely competitive prices.
The essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting and  maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability in the  management’s higher echelons.
The demands of Corporate  Governance require professionals to raise their competence  and capability levels to meet the expectations in managing the  enterprise and its resources effectively with the highest standards  of ethics.
It has thus become crucial to foster and sustain a culture  that integrates all components of good governance by carefully  balancing the complex inter-relationship among the Board of  Directors, Audit Committee, Corporate Social Responsibility and  Governance Committee, Finance, Compliance and Assurance  teams, Auditors and the senior management.
Our employee  satisfaction is reflected in the stability of our senior management,  low attrition across various levels and substantially higher  productivity.
Above all, we feel honoured to be integral to India’s  social development.
Details of several such initiatives are available  in the Report on Corporate Social Responsibility.
At RIL, we believe that as we move closer towards our aspirations  of being a global corporation, our Corporate Governance  standards must be globally benchmarked.
Therefore, we have  institutionalised the right building blocks for future growth.
The  building blocks will ensure that we achieve our ambition in a  prudent and sustainable manner.
RIL not only adheres to the  prescribed Corporate Governance practices as per the Listing  Regulations, but is also committed to sound Corporate Governance  principles and practices.
It constantly strives to adopt emerging  best practices being followed worldwide.
It is our endeavour to  achieve higher standards and provide oversight and guidance to  the management in strategy implementation, risk management  and fulfilment of stated goals and objectives.
Over the years, we have strengthened governance practices.
These practices define the way business is conducted and value  is generated.
Stakeholders’ interests are taken into account,  before making any business decision.
RIL has the distinction  of consistently rewarding its shareholders for four eventful  decades from its first IPO.
Since then, RIL has moved from one  big idea to another and these milestones continue to fuel its  relentless pursuit of ever-higher goals.
At RIL, Corporate Governance is an ethically driven business process that is committed to values,  aimed at enhancing its brand and reputation.
This is demonstrated in shareholder returns, high  credit ratings, governance processes and performance with conducive work environment.
RIL has  laid a strong foundation for making Corporate Governance a way of life by  having a mix of persons  of eminence and integrity at Board and leadership levels, including competent professionals across  the organisation and putting in place best systems, processes and technology.

RIL ’S SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING  JOURNEY RIL commenced annual reporting of its triple-bottom-line  performance from the financial year (FY) 2004-05.
All its  sustainability reports are assured externally.
The maiden report  in FY 2004-05, was based on then prevalent GRI G2 guidelines,  received ‘in-accordance’ status from GRI.
The subsequent  reports from FY 2006-07 to FY 2010-11 were based on ‘GRI  G3’ guidelines and GRI Checked with an ‘A+’ application  level.
From FY 2006-07, in addition to GRI G3 Sustainability  Reporting Guidelines, RIL referred to the American Petroleum  Institute / The International Petroleum Industry Environmental  Conservation Association (API/IPIECA), Sustainability  Reporting Guidelines and the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC) Principles.
From FY 2006-07, RIL has also aligned  its sustainability activities with the focus areas of the World  Business Council for Sustainable Development.
From FY 2011- 12, RIL adopted the newly published GRI G3.1 guidelines and  in addition referred to GRI G3.1 – Oil & Gas Sector Supplement.
In the same year, RIL also aligned its sustainability report with  the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental  Corporate   Governance Report 199 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE   OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT   REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER   INFORMA TION and Economic Responsibilities of Business framed by the  Government of India.
RIL was among the first to adopt GRI’s G4  Guidelines from FY 2014-15 and also aligned the G4 Report to  the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) released at the  United Nation Sustainable Development Summit in 2015 which  embrace a universal approach to the sustainable development  agenda.

INTEGRATED REPORTING During the year 2016-17, RIL has embraced integrated reporting  approach aligned with the International Integrated Reporting  Council’s (IIRC) <IR> framework.
The long term sustainability  of any business is not only limited to its financial or economic  value creation, but also depends, among other things, on the  timely and sufficient availability of natural resources, people  with the right skill sets, knowledge and technology to support  business processes and license to operate from all relevant  stakeholders.
The concept of six capitals as propounded by  the <IR> Framework also states the interrelatedness of each  capital to the other.
Value creation across each capital is  fundamental to the long term viability of RIL ’s business.
This  integrated annual report also spells out the extent to which RIL ’s  operations and strategy are integrated with the capitals viz; .

Life is Digital.
226 BOARD'S REPORT Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure  Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("Listing Regulations") is  presented in a separate section forming part of the Annual  Report.
The developments in business operations/performance of major  subsidiaries consolidated with the Company are as below: REFINING & MARKETING BUSINESS The revenue from the R&M segment increased y-o-y to   ₹ 2,50,833 crore (US$38.7 billion), reflecting higher average oil  prices and volumes during the year.
Refining EBIT increased by  6.5% y-o-y to a record level of ₹ 25,056 crore (US$ 3.9 billion),  supported by strong product demand, lower freight rates and  effective crude sourcing and robust risk management.
At US$11.0/bbl, refining margins were at an 8 (eight) year high.
Premium over Singapore GRM was also at an 8 (eight) year  high of US$5.2/bbl.
PETROCHEMICALS BUSINESS The revenue from the Petrochemicals segment increased by  12.2% y-o-y to ₹ 92,472 crore (US$ 14.3 billion), primarily due  to increase in prices across polymers and polyester chain.
Petrochemicals segment EBIT increased sharply by 27.5% to   ₹ 12,990 crore (US$ 2.0 billion), supported by favourable  product deltas and marginal volume growth.
Petrochemical  EBIT margins were at 5 (five) years high at the level of 14%.
OIL AND GAS (EXPLORATION &  PRODUCTION) BUSINESS During the year, the Company commenced commercial  production from its Coal Bed Methane block (CBM), at Sohagpur  (West).
The CBM project is India’s largest surface hydrocarbon  project.
The revenues for the domestic oil and gas operations  declined by 34.6% to Rs.
2,787 crore.
This was largely on account  of 23% decline in production and reduced gas price realisation.
Consequently domestic upstream operations registered  negative EBIT of Rs.
(131) crore.
In the US Shale operations,  weaker Natural Gas differentials in the Marcellus region along  with lower volumes resulted in lower revenues and EBITDA.
The business is taking a cautious approach to resuming  development and focusing on conserving cash and retaining  optionality.
RETAIL BUSINESS Reliance Retail achieved a turnover of ` 33,765 crore in   FY 2016- 17 as against ` 21,075 crore during the previous year,  registering a strong growth of 60.2%.

In addition to the retail stores, Reliance Retail  operated 448 fuel outlets as on March 31, 2017.
DIGITAL SERVICES Reliance Jio announced the commencement of services with  ‘Jio Welcome Offer’ in September 2016.
In a short period of 170  days, Jio crossed a milestone of 100 million customers on its all  IP wireless broadband network, reflecting an unprecedented  level of acceptance for any technology company globally.
In February 2017, Jio announced industry redefining tariff  plans as it embarked upon the world’s largest migration from  free to paid services.
It announced the Jio Prime Membership  for its initial customers and within a month of announcing the  Jio Prime offer, over 72 million Jio customers signed up for Jio  Prime, making it one of the most successful customer privilege  programmes anywhere in the world.
Within 6 months of the launch of Jio, India became the highest  mobile data user globally with a monthly consumption of over  1 billion GB.
This level of growth has been unprecedented on  any mobile network anywhere in the world, and is a testimony  to the comprehensive digital ecosystem that Jio has created.
Jio continues to expand its current LTE network coverage  foot print and is also deploying Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH)  technology for wire-line broadband and Carrier-Wi-Fi  technologies for broadband via public hotspots.
MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT Network18 improved its market-standing and continued  investing for growth in what was a tumultuous year for the  media industry.
The operating revenues on a consolidated basis  stood at ₹ 1,491 crore, down by 2.4% from ₹ 1,527 crore in FY  2015-16.
Driven by sustained investments into new businesses and  entry into more regional markets, Network18 reported an  consolidated EBIT of ₹ (201) crore for FY 2016-17, as against   ₹ 173 crore in FY 2015-16.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing  and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these standalone Ind  AS financial statements based on our audit.
We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the  accounting and auditing standards and matters which are required  to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act  and the Rules made thereunder.
We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial  statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified  under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Those Standards require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind  AS financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about the amounts and the disclosures in the standalone Ind  AS financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on  the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks  of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk  assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control  relevant to the Company’s preparation of the standalone Ind  AS financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to  design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL  FINANCIAL CONTROLS The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control  over financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control stated  in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India.
These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the  orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention  and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our  audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section  143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to  an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the  Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial  reporting was established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence  about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of  internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over financial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of  internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial  reporting.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the company are being made only in accordance with  authorisations of management and directors of the company; and  (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial  statements.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL  CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls  over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that  the internal financial control over financial reporting may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of  compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
OPINION In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to  the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material  respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial  reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2017, based  on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established  by the Company considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 A.
CORPORATE INFORMATION  Reliance Industries Limited (“the Company”) is a listed entity incorporated in India.
The addresses of its registered office and principal place of business are disclosed in the introduction to the annual report.
B.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES B.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION   The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for following assets and liabilities which have been  measured at fair value amount:  i) Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments),  ii) Defined benefit plans - plan assets and   iii) Equity settled share based payments   The financial statements of the Company have been prepared to comply with the Indian Accounting standards (‘Ind AS’), including  the rules notified under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.
Upto the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with the requirement of  Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which includes Standards notified under the Companies (Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2006 and considered as “Previous GAAP” .
These financial statements are the Company`s first Ind AS standalone financial statements.
Company’s financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (`), which is also its functional currency.
B.2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (a) Property, plant and equipment    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated  depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable  to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments  arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.
Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are  considered as pre - operative expenses and disclosed under Capital Work - in - Progress.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided using written down value method except in case of certain assets  from Refining segment  and Petrochemical segment & SEZ units / developer which are depreciated using straight line method.
Depreciation is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 except in  respect of the following assets, where useful life is different than those prescribed in Schedule II; Particular Depreciation  Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful life: 2 years or more) Over its useful life as technically assessed  Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful life: up to 2 years) 100% depreciated in the year of addition  Premium on Leasehold Land Over the period of lease term    The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial  year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset  is derecognised.
(b) Leases    Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease, transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of  ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.

The corresponding liability to the lessor  is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant  rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in Statement of Profit  and Loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalized.
Contingent rentals are  recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will  obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset  and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the  lease term except where another systematic basis is more representative of time pattern in which economic benefits from the  leased assets are consumed.
(c) Intangible assets    Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated  amortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if any.
Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly  attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and  adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the intangible assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is  derecognised.
A summary of amortisation policies applied to the Company’s intangible assets to the extent of depreciable amount is, as  follows: Particular Depreciation  Technical know – how Over the useful life of the underlying assets  Computer Software Over a period of 5 years Development Rights Depleted using the unit of production method.
The cost of producing wells along with its  related facilities including decommissioning costs are depleted in proportion of oil and gas  production achieved vis-à-vis Proved Developed Reserves.
The cost for common facilities  including its decommissioning costs are depleted using Proved Reserves.
Others Over the period of agreement of right to use, provided that in case of jetty, the aggregate  amount amortised to date is not less than the aggregate rebate availed by the Company   (d) Research and Development Expenditure    Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Development costs of products are  charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product’s technological and commercial feasibility has been established,  in which case such expenditure is capitalised  (e) Finance Cost    Borrowing costs include exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an  adjustment to the interest cost.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying  assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets.
A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time  to get ready for its intended use.
Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is  deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17  (f) Inventories    Items of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except  in case of by-products which are valued at net realisable value.
Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of  conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their  respective present location and condition.
Cost of raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted  average basis.
(g) Impairment of non-financial assets - property, plant and equipment and intangible assets    The Company assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets or group of assets, called cash generating units (CGU) may be impaired.
If any such indication exists the  recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any.
When it is not possible to  estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which  the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset’s carrying amount exceeds its  recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use.
Value in use  is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current  market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets.
The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable  amount.
(h) Provisions    Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is  probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable  estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when  appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time  is recognised as a finance cost.
Decommissioning liability    The Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity.
Decommissioning costs  are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfill  decommissioning obligations and are recognized as part of the cost of the underlying assets.
Any change in the present value  of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the  corresponding asset.
The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognized in the Statement of Profit and  Loss.
(i) Employee Benefits Expense   Short Term Employee Benefits    The undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by  employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.
Post-Employment Benefits   Defined Contribution Plans    A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays specified contributions to  a separate entity.
The Company makes specified monthly contributions towards Provident Fund, Superannuation Fund and  Pension Scheme.
The Company’s contribution is recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the  period in which the employee renders the related service.
Defined Benefit Plans    The Company pays gratuity to the employees whoever has completed five years of service with the Company at the time of  resignation/superannuation.
The gratuity is paid @15 days salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of  Gratuity Act 1972.
Standalone  Financial Statements 293 NOTES TO THE ST ANDALONE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2017 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE  OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER  INFORMA TION    The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the  employees.
The gratuity fund has been approved by respective IT authorities.
The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method  and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees’ services.
Re-measurement of defined benefit plans in respect of post-employment are charged to the Other Comprehensive Income.
Employee Separation Costs    Compensation to employees who have opted for retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme of the Company is  payable in the year of exercise of option by the employee.
The Company recognises the employee separation cost when the  scheme is announced and the Company is demonstrably committed to it.
(j) Tax Expenses    The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to  the extent that it relates to items recognised in the comprehensive income or in equity.
In which case, the tax is also recognised  in other comprehensive income or equity.
- Current tax     Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation  authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
- Deferred tax     Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the  financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the  liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted  by the end of the reporting period.
The carrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of  each reporting period.
(k) Share based payments    Equity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of  the equity instruments at the grant date.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share based  payments transactions are set out in Note 26.3.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over  the vesting period, based on the Company`s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding  increase in equity.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments  expected to vest.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such  that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments  Reserve.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per  share.
(l) Foreign currencies transactions and translation    Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and  liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency closing rates of exchange at the reporting  date.
Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss  except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency  borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, are capitalized as cost of assets.
Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related to the  acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17    Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange  rates at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using  the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary  items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item  (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or Statement of Profit and Loss are also  recognised in OCI or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).
(m) Revenue recognition    Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the  buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated cost can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing effective  control or managerial involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised when the performance of agreed contractual task has been completed.
Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account  contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
Revenue from operations includes sale of goods, services, service tax, excise duty and adjusted for discounts (net), and gain/ loss on corresponding hedge contracts.
Interest income   Interest income from a financial asset is recognised using effective interest rate method.
Dividends   Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment has been established.
(n) Financial instruments   i) Financial Assets    A.
Initial recognition and measurement      All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair value.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable  to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or  loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition.
Purchase and sale of financial assets are recognised using  trade date accounting.
B.
Subsequent measurement     a) Financial assets carried at amortised cost (AC)       A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to  hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset  give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding.
b) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)       A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by  both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial  asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
c) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)       A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL.
C. Investment in subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures      The Company has accounted for its investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost.
D. Other Equity Investments      All other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Statement of Profit and  Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Company has elected to present the value changes in  ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ .
Standalone  Financial Statements 295 NOTES TO THE ST ANDALONE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH, 2017 02-56 57-179 180-277 278-419 420-452 CORPORA TE  OVERVIEW MANAGEMENT  REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL   ST A TEMENTS SHAREHOLDER  INFORMA TION    E. Impairment of financial assets      In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of  financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL).
Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:       The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the  financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or       Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over  the life of the financial instrument)      For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be  recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
The Company uses historical default rates to determine  impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables.
At every reporting date these historical default rates are  reviewed and changes in the forward looking estimates are analysed.
For other assets, the Company uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant  increase in credit risk.
If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.
ii) Financial liabilities    A.
Initial recognition and measurement      All financial liabilities are recognized at fair value and in case of loans, net of directly attributable cost.
Fees of  recurring nature are directly recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.
B.
Subsequent measurement      Financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
For trade and other payables  maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the  short maturity of these instruments.
iii) Derivative financial instruments and Hedge Accounting     The Company uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards &  options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is  entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair  value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Statement of Profit and  Loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later  to Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss or treated as basis adjustment if a hedged  forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial assets or non-financial liability.
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:    a) Cash flow hedge      The Company designates derivative contracts or non derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging instruments  to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on  highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions.
When  a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value  of the derivative is recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of other comprehensive income.
Any  ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative  gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was  effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs.
The cumulative gain or loss  previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the  occurrence of the underlying transaction.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the  amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17    b) Fair Value Hedge       The Company designates derivative contracts or non derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging instruments  to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange  rates and commodity prices.
Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value  hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria  for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest  method is used is amortised to Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.
iv) Derecognition of financial instruments     The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire  or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109.
A financial liability (or  a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the  contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
(o) Accounting For Oil and Gas Activity    The Company has adopted Successful Efforts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities.
The policy of  recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM.
Seismic costs, geological  and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to  exploration and evaluation activities are expensed off.
The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks  and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible Assets under  Development.
All development costs incurred in respect of Proved reserves are also capitalized under Intangible Assets under  Development.
Untill a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets under  Development are classified as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves.
The exploration and  evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production  are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company used technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and  standard geological and reservoir engineering methods.
The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually.
Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of joint operations.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and  expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Company’s  financial statements, according to the participating interest of the Company.
C. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY   The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about these  assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities  affected in future periods.
a) Estimation of oil and gas reserves    The determination of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to  be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data,  reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the  determination of the Company’s estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves.
The Company bases its proved reserves estimates  on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional  industry practice and regulatory requirements.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Company’s oil and gas properties.
The  impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the  asset over the expected future production.
Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the  recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements.
Details on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 31.2.

The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions.
These  include; the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field,  expected utilization of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.
c) Depreciation / amortisation and useful lives of property plant and equipment / intangible assets    Property, plant and equipment / intangible assets are depreciated / amortised over their estimated useful lives, after taking  into account estimated residual value.
Management reviews the estimated useful lives and residual values of the assets  annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation / amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period.
The  useful lives and residual values are based on the Company’s historical experience with similar assets and take into account  anticipated technological changes.
The depreciation / amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes  from previous estimates.
d) Recoverability of trade receivable    Judgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision  against those receivables is required.
Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing  of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.
e) Provisions    Provisions and liabilities are recognized in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a future outflow of funds  resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cash outflow can be reliably estimated.
The timing of recognition  and quantification of the liability requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be  subject to change.
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of  changing facts and circumstances.
f) Impairment of non-financial assets    The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any indication  exists, the Company estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or Cash  Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
It is determined for an individual asset, unless the  asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or a groups of assets.
Where the  carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its  recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In determining fair value less  costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate  valuation model is used.
g) Impairment of financial assets    The impairment provisions for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates.
The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on  Company’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
D. FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS   The Company has adopted Ind AS with effect from 1st April 2016 with comparatives being restated.
Accordingly the impact of  transition has been provided in the Opening Reserves as at 1st April 2015.
The figures for the previous period have been restated,  regrouped and reclassified wherever required to comply with the requirement of Ind AS and Schedule III.

The above information  is certified by the actuary.
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition  of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Company’s policy for Plan Assets  Management.
VII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with FY 2016-17.

The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably  possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period , while holding all other assumptions  constant.

Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset  by an increase in the return on the plan debt investments.
Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

31.3  Government of India (GOI), by its letters dated 2nd May, 2012, 14th November, 2013, 10th July, 2014 and 3rd June 2016 has  communicated that it proposes to disallow certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KG-DWN-98/3  entitles the Company to recover.
Based on legal advice received, the Company continues to maintain that a Contractor is entitled to  recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the Government to disallow the recovery of any  Contract Cost as defined in the PSC.
The Company has already referred the issue to arbitration and already communicated the same to  GOI for resolution of disputes.
Pending decision of the arbitration, the demand from the GOI of $ 148 million (for ` 961 crore) being the  Company's Share (total demand $ 247 million) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17 31.4 (a)  The Government has made a claim of about $ 1.55 billion against the KGD6 Contractor parties in respect of gas said to have  migrated from neighbouring blocks.
In carrying out petroleum operations, the Contractor has worked within the boundaries  of the block awarded to it and has complied with all applicable regulations and provisions of the Production Sharing Contract  (“PSC”).
The Company has already invoked the dispute resolution mechanism in the PSC and issued a Notice of Arbitration  to the Government on 11th November, 2016.
The Company remains convinced of being able to fully justify and vindicate its  position that the Government’s claim is not sustainable.
(b)  In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no.
22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V.
dated 10th January, 2014, the GoI notified  the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014, on 26th October 2014.
Consequent to the aforesaid dispute referred  to under 31.3 above which has been referred to arbitration, the GoI has directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit  differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the above guidelines converted  to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account  maintained by GAIL (India) Limited.
The amount so deposited by customers to Gas Pool Account is ` 295 crore (net) as at  31st March 2017 and is disclosed under Other Non-Current Assets.
Revenue has been recognized at the GoI notified prices in  respect of gas quantities sold.
(c)  In December 2010, the Company and BG Exploration and Production India Limited (together, the ’Claimants‘) referred a  number of disputes, differences and claims arising under two Production Sharing Contracts entered into in 1994 among the  Claimants, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and the Government (the ’PSCs‘) to arbitration.
The disputes relate  to, among other things, the limits of cost recovery, profit sharing and audit and accounting provisions of the PSCs.
the Tribunal  by majority issued a final partial award (“FPA”), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 October 2016.
Claimants have challenged certain parts of the FPA before the English Court and the English court has initiated steps to effect  service of the Challenge proceedings upon the Government.
(d)  NTPC had filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for supply of natural gas by RIL before the Hon’ble Bombay High  Court.
The main issue in dispute is whether a valid, concluded and binding contract exists between the parties for supply of  Natural Gas of 132 Trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years.
The matter is presently sub judice and RIL is of the view that  NTPC’s claim lacks merit and no binding contract for supply of gas was executed between NTPC and RIL.
”  (e)  Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible  exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations.

Notes:   I  Change in accounting policy for Oil & Gas Activity – From Full cost method (FCM) to Successful Efforts Method (SEM):      The impact on account of change in accounting policy from FCM to SEM is recognised in the Opening Reserves on the  date of transition and consequential impact of depletion and write offs is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Major differences impacting such change of accounting policy are in the areas of;    - Expenditure on surrendered blocks, unproved wells and abandoned wells, which has been expensed under SEM.
-  Depletion on producing property in SEM is calculated using Proved Developed Reserve, as against Proved Reserve  in FCM.
II Fair valuation as deemed cost for Property, Plant and Equipment:     The Company have considered fair value for property, viz land admeasuring over 30,000 acres, situated in India, with  impact of ` 41,292 crore in accordance with stipulations of Ind AS 101 with the resultant impact being accounted for in  the reserves.
III Fair valuation for Financial Assets:     The Company has valued financial assets (other than Investment in subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures which  are accounted at cost), at fair value.
Impact of fair value changes as on the date of transition, is recognised in opening  reserves and changes thereafter are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss or Other Comprehensive Income, as the  case may be.
IV Deferred Tax:     The impact of transition adjustments together with Ind AS mandate of using balance sheet approach (against profit and  loss approach in the previous GAAP) for computation of deferred taxes has resulted in charge to the Reserves, on the  date of transition, with consequential impact to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the subsequent periods.
V Others:    Other adjustments primarily comprise of :    a.  Attributing time value of money to Assets Retirement Obligation: Under Ind AS, such obligation is recognised  and measured at present value.
Under previous Indian GAAP it was recorded at cost.
The impact for the periods  subsequent to the date of transition is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
b.
Loan processing fees / transaction cost: Under Ind AS such expenditure are considered for calculating effective  interest rate.
The impact for the periods subsequent to the date of transition is reflected in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.

The  procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or  error.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the other  auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters  paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our audit opinion on the Holding Company, its subsidiaries,  associates and jointly controlled entities incorporated in India,  internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures  of the company are being made only in accordance with  authorisations of management and directors of the company; and  (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial  statements.

Integrated Annual Report 2016-17   VII)   The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2016-17.
VIII)   These plan’s  typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment risk, interest risk, longevity risk and salary risk.
Investment  Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially  offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.
An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants.
As such, an increase in the salary of the plan’s participants will increase the plan’s  liability.

2. DIVIDEND 2.1  WHAT ARE THE MODES BY WHICH THE  DIVIDEND IS PAID?

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has  implemented an electronic payment service termed as  “National Automated Clearing House (NACH)” for banks,  financial institutions, Corporates and Government  Departments.
It is a centralised system, launched with an  aim to consolidate multiple Electronic Clearing Systems  running across the country, and has both Debit and Credit  variants.
NACH aims at facilitating inter-bank, high volume,  debit/credit transactions, which are bulk and repetitive  in nature.
NACH system covers several Core Banking  enabled banks spread across the geography of the country  irrespective of the location of the bank branches.
2.3  WHAT IS NACH CREDIT FOR PA YMENT OF  DIVIDEND AND HOW DOES IT OPERATE?
NACH Credit is an electronic payment service used for  affording credits to a large number of beneficiaries in their  bank accounts for the payment of dividend by raising a  single debit to the bank account of the user entity.
NACH  operates on the principle of single debit to the sponsor  bank’s account and multiple credits to different destination  banks’ accounts.

Some of the major benefits are:  a.
Investor need not make frequent visits to his bank for  depositing the physical paper instruments.
b.
Prompt credit is given to the bank account of the  investor through electronic clearing.
c. Fraudulent encashment of warrants is avoided.
d. Exposure to delays / loss in postal service are avoided.
e.  Issue of duplicate warrants is avoided as there can be  no loss in transit of warrants.
2.5 HOW TO AVAIL OF NACH FACILITY?
Investors holding shares in physical form may send their  NACH Mandate Form, duly filled in, to the Company’s  R&TA.
The Form may be downloaded from the “Downloads”  section under the “Investor Relations” dropdown on the  Company’s website, www.ril.com.
However, if shares are held in dematerialised form, NACH  Mandate has to be filed with the concerned DP directly, in  the format prescribed by the DP .
Investors must note that NACH essentially operates on the  new and unique bank account number, allotted by banks  post implementation of Core Banking Solutions (CBS) for  centralized processing of inward instructions and efficiency  in handling bulk transactions.
In this regard, shareholders are requested to furnish their  new bank account number allotted by the banks post  implementation of CBS, along with a cancelled cheque  pertaining to the concerned account:   (a) to the R&TA of the Company in case the shareholders  hold shares in physical form; and (b) to the concerned DP in  case the shareholders hold shares in demat form.
2.6 CAN INVESTORS OPT OUT OF NACH FACILITY?
Investors have a right to opt out from this mode of  payment by giving an advance notice of four weeks, prior  to payment of dividend, either to the Company’s R&TA or to  the concerned DP , as the case may be.
2.7  WHAT IS PA YMENT OF DIVIDEND THROUGH  NEFT FACILITY AND HOW DOES IT OPERATE?
NEFT is a nation-wide payment system facilitating  electronic transfer of funds from one account to another.
Dividend payment through NEFT denotes payment of  dividend electronically through RBI clearing to selected  bank branches which have implemented Core Banking  Solutions (CBS).
This extends to all over the country, and  is not necessarily restricted to the designated centres  where payment can be handled through Electronic  Clearing System.
To facilitate payment through NEFT,  the shareholder is required to ensure that the bank  branch where his/her account is operated, is under  CBS.
The shareholders shall also ensure that particulars  of the updated bank account are registered with the  Company’s R&TA in case shares are held in physical form  and with the concerned DP in case shares are held in  demat form.
2.8  WHAT IS PA YMENT OF DIVIDEND THROUGH  DIRECT CREDIT AND HOW DOES IT OPERATE?
The Company appoints a bank as its Dividend banker for  distribution of dividend.
The said banker carries out direct  credit to those investors who are maintaining accounts  with the said bank, provided the bank account details are  registered with the DP for dematerialised shares or with  the Company’s R&TA prior to the payment of dividend for  shares held in physical form.
2.9  WHAT SHOULD A SHAREHOLDER DO IN CASE  OF NON-RECEIPT OF DIVIDEND?
Shareholders should write to the Company’s R&TA,  furnishing the particulars of the dividend not received, and  quoting the folio number / DPID and Client ID particulars,  as the case may be.
On expiry of the validity period, if the  dividend warrant remains unpaid in the records of the  Company, a duplicate warrant will be issued.
The R&TA  would request the concerned shareholder to execute an  indemnity before issuing the duplicate warrant.
No duplicate warrants will be issued against those shares  wherein a ‘stop transfer indicator’ has been instituted either  by virtue of a complaint or by law, unless the procedure for  releasing the same has been completed.
2.10  WHY DO THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE TO WAIT   TILL THE EXPIRY OF THE VALIDITY PERIOD  OF THE ORIGINAL WARRANT FOR ISSUE OF  DUPLICATE WARRANT?
Since the dividend warrants are payable at par at several  centres across the country, banks do not accept ‘stop  payment’ instructions.
Hence, shareholders have to wait till  the expiry of the validity of the original warrant for issue of  duplicate warrant.
Validity of dividend Warrant is for three  months from the date of issue.
2.11WHY SHARES SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED     BEFORE THE BOOK CLOSURE/ RECORD DATE  FIXED FOR DIVIDEND PA YMENT?
The dividend on shares lying in the clearing account of the  brokers cannot be made available to the members directly  by the Company.
In case an investor has bought any shares,  he must ensure that the shares are transferred to his demat  account before the book closure / record date.
