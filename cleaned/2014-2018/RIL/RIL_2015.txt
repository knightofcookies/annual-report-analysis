Our Petrochemicals  business margins improved on the  back of healthy polymer and polyester  deltas, partly offset by weak fibre  intermediate deltas.
Domestic upstream production  was lower due to natural decline in  the producing fields.
Reliance and  its partners are trying to augment  production through interventions  to partly offset the natural decline.
Our US shale business recorded its  highest production and is a material  contributor to our earnings.
Reliance further strengthened its  leadership position as India’s largest  retailer.
We have increased our  presence to 200 cities.
Our efforts to provide 4G services  across the country is gathering  momentum.
During the year, based on  our acquisition of additional spectrum,  we have emerged as the largest  holder of liberalized spectrum in India.
This will truly be a transformational  initiative that will once again validate  Reliance’s ability to conceive and  execute large projects across the  country.
During the year, Independent  Media Trust, of which RIL is the sole  beneficiary, acquired the control  of Network18 and its subsidiary  TV18.
This acquisition will enhance  the offering to the customers by  integrating telecom, web and digital  technologies.
REFINING & MARKETING  The world’s largest refinery complex  at Jamnagar maintained a high  operating rate of 110%, processing  67.9 MMT of crude oil during the year.
This is in comparison to the average  refinery utilization rates of 86.9% in  North America, 80.7% in Europe and  83.5% in Asia.
This is a testimony to our  operational excellence and world-class  assets.
The high capacity utilization  was supported by Reliance’s ability  to process advantaged feedstock,  flexibility to upgrade low value  products and place products in  a dynamic market environment.
Our Refining business delivered  record EBIT of `15,827 crore and gross  refining margins of $ 8.6/bbl.
During the year, over 300 fuel retailing  outlets were commissioned, with plans  to re-commission the entire network  of 1,400 outlets by the end of FY 2015- 16.
Our focus is to ensure consistent  and superior customer experience  through several technology-enabled  initiatives.
Our petcoke gasification project,  designed to convert low-value  petroleum coke into high value syngas  is under execution.
This will enable  increasing self-sufficiency in energy  at Jamnagar and also manufacture  of other value-added chemicals.
This project will also significantly  reduce energy costs for Jamnagar  refineries and make them competitive  compared to the North American  refineries which are benefiting from  the shale gas revolution.
PETROCHEMICALS  The steep decline in global energy  prices and increased supply from  the US led to sharp decline in  petrochemical products and feedstock  prices.
Our integrated operations and  diversified feedstock slate coupled  with global cost competitiveness  helped mitigate some of the risks.
RIL is creating significant capacities to  further enhance its position amongst  the world’s largest producers of  petrochemicals, with global scale  capacities across the polymer and  polyester chain.
During the year,  our focus was on creation of new  capacities with several new plants  being added and stabilizing the  operations of the new facilities.
During the year, the operations of the  new Polyester Filament Yarn (PFY)  facility at Silvassa were stabilized and  this strengthened our position as one  of the global leaders in production of  polyester fibre and yarn.
In the current year, RIL started India’s  largest Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR)  Plant at Hazira with capacity of  150 KTPA.
We also expanded our Poly- Butadiene Rubber (PBR) capacity.
This  will help in reaffirming our domestic  leadership position in the elastomers  segment.
RIL also started new 650 KTPA PET  plant at Dahej, which is one of the  world’s largest bottle grade PET resin  capacity at a single location.
Our new  PTA facility at Dahej with a capacity  of 1,150 KTPA was also commissioned  ` 1,00,000 crore Invested in creating  growth engines for the future ` 23,566 crore Highest ever consolidated   net profit in 2014-15 ` 15,827 crore Record EBIT of Refining &  Marketing Business 4 Annual Report 2014-15Invest.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Dear Fellow Shareowners, Reliance has always believed in  investing in India and in businesses  of the future.
FY 2014-15 was a  landmark year for our company.
We have invested over $ 16 billion  or over ` 1,00,000 crore in creating  growth engines for the future.
This  is the highest ever in the history of  our company and is a testimony to  our project execution capabilities.
This is also the highest by any Indian  corporate in a single year and is about  0.8% of India’s GDP .
The global economy in FY 2014-15  saw a steep decline in oil prices, which  had significant impact on energy  businesses.
This coupled with slowing  growth in some of the leading global  economies impacted currencies.
But,  there was positive news in terms of  faster-than-anticipated economic  growth recovery in the United States,  which provided momentum for the  global economic recovery.
India’s economy is in the midst of a  recovery with lower fiscal and current  account deficit, lower inflation and  weak commodity prices.
Our country’s  growth seems poised to return to a  high-growth path.
It is in this context that Reliance  continues its quest for sustained  growth.
I am pleased to inform you  that Reliance achieved its highest ever  consolidated net profits of ` 23,566  crore ($ 3.8 billion) during the year.
Both our energy businesses and  consumer businesses continue to  show strong growth potential.
Mukesh D. Ambani , Chairman and Managing Director I am delighted to write to you once again to  update you on the performance of Reliance  Industries Limited.
Reliance continues to set new  benchmarks and records despite a challenging  global economic scenario marked by volatile  commodity prices, weak growth in certain major  economies and dollar appreciation against most  major global currencies.
7 US shale business showed strong  operational performance.
During the  CY 2014, gross JV production showed  a 26% year on year growth.
CONSUMER BUSINESSES  Our Retail business sustained its  growth momentum by generating  record revenues of ` 17,640 crore.
This is a growth of 31% CAGR over  the last five years.
We also enhanced  our presence with 2,621 stores spread  across 12.5 million square feet in 200  cities.
During the year, we had a net  addition of 930 stores – at almost 18  new stores every week.
We continue  to strengthen our retail offerings  to provide unmatched choice and  affordable pricing.
We are building  on our leadership positions in all the  format sectors of grocery, apparel and  digital products.
Reliance Jio Infocomm’s ambitious  project to provide reliable (4G) high  speed internet services with rich  communication and digital services  continues to gather speed.
We have  made significant progress including  physical network infrastructure,  systems and processes, sales and  distribution network, applications and  services and content.
We are currently  working with several strategic partners  in deployment and testing activities  currently underway.
During the year, we were successful  in acquiring right to use spectrum in  800 MHz or 1800 MHz bands or both  in 13 key circles across India.
With this,  Reliance Jio Infocomm has spectrum  in either 800 MHz or 1800 MHz or both  in 20 out of 22 circles in the country.
This is in addition to the pan India  spectrum in the 2300 MHz band.
ROBUST BALANCE SHEET  RIL enjoys top-notch credit ratings  as a result of its financial prudence  and strong balance sheet.
During the  year RIL and its subsidiaries tied-up  long-term facilities of nearly $ 6.5  billion.
Our facilities with Export Credit  Agencies were accorded ‘Better than  Sovereign’ rating by all the ECAs – this  was the first time that these agencies  have accorded such a rating to any  corporate in their history.
RIL has always been in the forefront  of investing in India and its growth.
During the year, as part of our  largest capital expenditure cycle, we  invested over ` 1,00,000 crore.
This  large investment spread across all our  businesses will create sustained and  significant value for our stakeholders.
BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION  Our work on Business Transformation  and next-gen people practices  continued at an accelerated pace.
It is  an integral part of Reliance’s strategy to  build competitive advantage and use  technology for its advantage.
We rolled  out “Our Values & Behaviours” to guide  Reliance and its talent through our  vision and mission in the coming years.
COMMITMENT  TO SOCIAL WELLNESS  As a responsible corporate citizen,  Reliance serves the society, through  Reliance Foundation, in the domains  of Rural Transformation, Education,  Healthcare, Urban Renewal and  Arts, Culture and Heritage.
Our relief  and rehabilitation efforts in Kashmir  and other areas affected by natural  calamities earned significant respect.
During the year, Reliance contributed  ` 761 crore towards CSR activities,  accounting for 3.35% of profit after tax.
I would like to thank all my colleagues  across the country and the globe  for their unflinching dedication,  commitment and contribution to  strengthening Reliance.

Demand for petrochemicals is strongly  linked to economic growth.
India’s  expected economic growth bodes  well for the growth of this business.
We are bringing several new capacities  on-stream in time to leverage the  expected spurt in demand.
We are building one of the world’s  largest ethylene crackers taking  advantage of refinery integration at  Jamnagar.
The new cracker will be in  the top decile in terms of global cost  competitiveness on an integrated  basis among all the new crackers that  are being built.
With implementation  of all the petrochemicals expansion  projects, RIL is likely to be among  the top 10 global petrochemicals  producers in the world.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  Our domestic gas production from the  KG-D6 block was lower due to natural  decline during the year.
RIL and its JV  partners stepped-up their efforts to  augment production from the field  through interventions like side-track  wells and onshore terminal booster  compressor to partly offset the natural  decline in the field.
Development effort at the two CBM  blocks in Sohagpur East and Sohagpur  West is making significant progress.
RIL expects first production from these  two blocks in FY 2015-16.
Despite extremely challenging pricing  environment especially in oil, the  Exploration &  Production Development effort at the two  CBM blocks in Sohagpur East and  Sohagpur West is making significant  progress.

The  Company assumes no responsibility to publicly amend,  modify or revise any such statements on the basis of  subsequent developments, information or events.
OVERVIEW The global economy in FY 2014-15 witnessed divergent  trends among major economies and stress on major oil  producing countries as a direct result of sharp decline in  energy prices, especially in the second half of the year.
Strong growth in oil output from non-OPEC (Organisation  of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) producers, coupled  with weak demand in some key consumption economies  led to an oversupplied oil market, precipitating a sharp  decline in oil prices, during the year.
The decline in oil  prices was further accentuated by OPEC’s decision not  to cut back production in their respective countries.
A sustained lower oil price environment will benefit  commodity importing countries, such as India.
Falling  energy prices have significantly improved India’s overall  fiscal landscape, and augur well for growth in domestic  consumption.
Despite unpredictable headwinds, the global economic  recovery is gaining momentum.
These winds of positive  change have masked the growth divergence among  major economies.
Specifically, the recovery in United States was stronger  than expected, while performance in Japan and Eurozone  has fallen short of expectations.
This has resulted in the  dollar appreciating vis-à-vis other G7 currencies.
The  currencies of commodity exporting countries weakened  due to fiscal and trade imbalances.
India’s economy is poised to return to its high-growth  path, thanks to lower fiscal and current account deficits,  falling inflation, benign commodity prices, and structural  reforms to boost investments.
Monetary policy is also  likely to be supportive with the Reserve Bank of India  (RBI) having moved to flexible inflation targeting.
The  manufacturing sector is likely to benefit from lower  interest rates.
The share of investments in Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) is at 29% (compared to 33% in 2007) and  is expected to pick up.
However, productivity and capital  efficiency improvement are likely to drive near-term  growth.
Despite the significant decline in commodity prices,  Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) delivered a robust  financial performance, led by record earnings from the  refining business.
The dramatic fall in crude oil prices  impacted RIL ’s upstream business, and resulted in  lower revenues and stock values for the refining and  petrochemical businesses.
However, the benefits from  demand revival, strong product margins and lower energy  costs outweighed inventory effects, and both refining and  petrochemical businesses ended the year on a strong  note.
In FY 2014-15, Reliance (consolidated RIL) achieved:   Highest ever consolidated net profit of ` 23,566 crore  ($ 3.8 billion)   Record Refining EBIT of ` 15,827 crore ($ 2.5 billion),  Gross Refining Margins (GRM) of $ 8.6/barrel (bbl)   Dividend of 100%, payout of ` 3,559 crore ($ 569  million) Operationally, RIL continues to optimally utilise its best- in-class downstream assets, with near full utilisation  levels in most petrochemical units.
RIL processed 67.9  million metric tonnes (MMT) of crude oil at its Jamnagar  refinery complex, achieving 110% operating rate.
Continuing its emphasis on processing challenging and  most advantageous crudes, RIL processed 13 new crudes  during the year.
The crude sourcing strategy was driven  by continuous adjustment of sourcing pattern based  on relative economics.
The ability to operate at high  utilisation levels and switch product slate to suit market  conditions enable RIL to capture margin optimisation  opportunities in the market.
RIL ranked 114 th in the Fortune Global 500 list of the  World’s Largest Corporations in terms of revenues, and was  Processed 67.9 MMT of crude oil   at Jamnagar refinery 02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 47 ranked 155th in terms of profits.
This is the 11th consecutive  year that RIL has featured in the Fortune Global 500 list.
HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY EVENTS Reliance delivered an industry-leading performance  across its refining and petrochemicals business, despite a  challenging crude market environment.
Its international  upstream business demonstrated strong volume growth,  whilst domestic Exploration and Production (E&P)  business witnessed lower production due to geological  complexities and natural decline in the fields.
Reliance  also made substantial progress on various projects in  the refining and petrochemicals business during the  year.
These initiatives are expected to create significant  value for its stakeholders.
Furthermore, strong growth  momentum was maintained in its consumer-facing retail  business.
Refining and Marketing – Record earnings The refining business delivered record earnings, driven  by strong underlying business performance.
Refining  margins were robust on the back of healthy product  cracks and lower energy costs.
The year’s key highlight  was the dramatic decline in crude prices.
Continuous  non-OPEC crude oil production growth, led by the US,  partial return of Libyan barrels, muted oil demand growth  resulted in an oversupplied crude market, leading to a  sharp decline in crude oil prices.
The fall of oil price was  further accentuated by OPEC’s decision not to cut back  production in their respective countries.
RIL ’s refining  margins at $ 8.6/bbl significantly outperformed regional  benchmarks as the superior configuration of its refineries  enabled it to benefit from strong light product cracks,  favourable crude differentials and stable middle distillate  cracks.
Petrochemicals – Focus on capacity creation Petrochemical business EBIT margins improved to 8.6%  from 8.1% in the previous year.
The improvement in EBIT  margins were aided by firm polymer and polyester deltas,  partly offset by weak fibre intermediates deltas.
RIL successfully stabilised the production at its new  Polyester Filament Yarn (PFY) facility at Silvassa, which had  started production towards the end of the last financial  year.
This expansion has further strengthened RIL ’s  position among the world’s largest producers of polyester  fibre and yarn.
The new PFY plant at Silvassa is the most  automated and one of the most environment-friendly  plants globally.
During the year, RIL also started production at its new  150 kilo tonnes per annum (KTPA) capacity Styrene  Butadiene Rubber (SBR) plant at Hazira, which is also  India’s largest plant.
The plant has capability to produce  an entire range of dry as well as oil extended grades of  emulsion SBR.
With this, RIL has reaffirmed its leadership  in synthetic rubbers in the Indian market.
During FY 2014-15, RIL also expanded its Poly-Butadiene  Rubber (PBR) capacity.

The decline in turnover reflects sharp fall in crude oil  prices during the second half of the year.
Crude oil price  averaged at $ 85.4/bbl for the year, a fall of 21% on y-o-y  basis.
With decrease in oil and product prices, exports  from India were lower by 17.1% at ` 2,28,651 crore ($ 36.6  billion) as against ` 2,75,825 crore in the previous year.
Refining segment contributed 71% of revenues  (including inter-divisional transfers).
Refining  segment revenues were lower by 16% on y-o-y basis  reflecting lower average crude oil and product prices.
Petrochemicals business accounted for 20% of  revenues, lower by 7% on y-o-y basis as product  prices declined along with sharp fall in feedstock and  crude oil prices.
Oil & Gas business revenue grew by 6%, compared to  previous year primarily on account of 27% increase  in shale gas production which was partially offset by  lower production from Panna-Mukta, Tapti and KG-D6  block in India.
Operating profit before other income and depreciation  increased by 7.3% on a y-o-y basis from ` 34,799 crore to   ` 37,364 crore ($ 6.0 billion).
Strong operating performance from the refining business  and stable petrochemicals business performance led  to higher operating profits.

Petrochemical segment EBIT remained stable at   ` 8,291 crore ($ 1.3 billion), with strong polymer deltas  compensating for weaker fibre intermediates deltas.
Oil &  Gas segment EBIT grew by 13% to ` 3,181 crore, led by  strong growth in US shale volumes.
Other income  was lower at ` 8,495 crore ($ 1.4 billion)  as against ` 8,911 crore in the previous year, primarily  on account of lower average investments.
Other income  includes interest income of ` 4,513 crore and investment  income of ` 3,516 crore.
Interest cost was lower at ` 3,316 crore ($ 531 million) as  against ` 3,836 crore in FY 2013-14.
Interest capitalised  was higher at ` 4,409 crore ($ 705 million) as against   ` 1,758 crore last year, on account of ongoing expansion  projects in the petrochemicals, refining, US shale gas  business and also broadband access project.
Depreciation (including depletion and amortisation) was  marginally higher at ` 11,547 crore ($ 1.8 billion) as against  ` 11,201 crore in FY 2013-14.
This was primarily on account  of higher depletion charges in US shale gas business,  which was in line with increase in production.
Profit after tax  for the year was at ` 23,566 crore ($ 3.8  billion), an increase of 4.8% over ` 22,493 crore in the  previous year.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REFINING AND MARKETING Refining & Marketing (R&M) business segment sources  crude and feedstock from the international markets,  processes it at Jamnagar refinery complex and sells high  value petroleum products globally.
RIL generates value  by processing the most advantaged crudes, optimally  utilising refinery assets and placing products in the highest  net-back markets.
RIL manages high quality refining assets  with advantaged design capacity for processing 1.24  million barrels per day (MMBPD) of crude, fully utilising  the range of options and flexibility that is built into them.
Reliance’s global footprint includes international trading  locations (in US, London and Singapore), international  tankages and presence in East Africa through GAPCO.
During FY 2014-15, R&M business posted record earnings,  despite volatile market conditions, driven primarily by  good product price realisations, lower energy costs,  superior configuration, asset optimisation and trading  capabilities.
Market environment - Global Second half oil demand recovery with fall in oil prices OECD demand reduced by 0.5 MMBPD due to lower  consumption in Europe and Japan, non-OECD demand  grew by 1.1 MMBPD.
Sluggish Chinese demand and  improved energy efficiency in non-OECD countries have  led to the slowdown in demand growth.
This year’s oil  demand growth is marked by two contrasting halves.
Sluggish Chinese demand, improving efficiency standards,  especially in the OECD economies led to a marginal  decline in oil demand in the first half of 2014.
The steep fall in oil prices has had a significant macro- economic impact on oil producers and consumers.
It  benefited oil importers with higher disposable income  02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 51 for consumers and lower costs in the production of final  goods.
For many importers, the boost from lower oil  prices, while sizable, is somewhat muted by the recent  currency depreciation against the US dollar.
This implies  a smaller oil price decline in domestic currency.
On the  other hand, oil exporters’ real incomes and profits have  generally decreased.
But overall the sharp decline in oil prices boosted  consumption leading to a strong growth in the second  half of 2014.
In 2014, average oil demand grew by   0.7 MMBPD to 92.5 MMBPD.
Oil markets remained oversupplied, dominated by non- OPEC supply  On the supply side, overall crude oil supply increased by  2.0 MMBPD in 2014, driven entirely by non-OPEC supply,  leaving OPEC production more or less flat.
Geo-political tension and social unrest in several major  oil exporting countries in the Middle East and Africa was  overshadowed by persistent oversupply in the oil market.
The main feature was the growth in US oil production  which surged by 1.6 MMBPD in 2014.
Significant  production increase in Iraq (0.25 MMBPD), Canada (0.25  MMBPD) and Brazil (0.19 MMBPD) also contributed  to overall supply.
Post the steep oil price drop in the  second half of 2014, most upstream players in the US  have announced very significant cut in their capex  programme.
This may restrict growth in US shale oil  production from the second half of 2015.
Oil prices collapsed by over 50%, after remaining range- bound for nearly 3 years  This gap between supply growth of 2.0 MMBPD and  demand of less than 1 MMBPD had put pressure on OPEC  to cut production.
Oil prices had traded in a range of $100  – $115/bbl from 2010 until around mid-June of 2014.
The average Brent price was $ 109/bbl from January to  June in 2014, but then started to drift down and then by  September moved sharply lower.
This was triggered by  Saudi Arabia clearly signalling its unwillingness to absorb  the excess supply, so prices had to fall to make storage  economics work in the near term and in the medium term  trigger the actions to balance supply and demand.
The steep fall in crude prices has led to a reduction in  planned upstream investments.
This is expected to   have short-term and long-term effects.
The decline in  investments in the US shale oil may have an early impact  on reduction in oil production, while decline in other high  cost E&P investments by oil majors could have long-term  consequences on future crude supplies.

New refinery additions and  expansions in existing refineries were partly offset by  closures in the US, Europe and Japan, leading to a net  capacity addition of about 0.6 MMBPD, compared to  demand growth of 0.7 MMBPD.
Lower oil prices and higher  margins led to an increase in average refinery utilisation  rates in North America (86.9% in FY 2014-15 compared  to 85.1% in FY 2013-14) and Europe (80.7% in FY 2014-15  compared to 78.2% in FY 2013-14).

Naphtha strength continued in  the last quarter supported by both petrochemicals and  gasoline demand.
Middle distillates Middle distillates (both diesel and jet/kerosene) weakened  when compared to last year, mostly on slow demand  growth in major consuming countries like China, India  and Indonesia.
Cracks got some support due to falling  crude prices.
Gasoil cracks gained some strength in the  last quarter as China’s effort to stimulate its economy by  cutting interest rates supported demand, and low pump  prices in India aided a demand recovery especially during  the last quarter of the year.
Jet cracks were weak during the first half of the year;  however bounced back in the second half on improved air  travel demand and maintenance/unplanned outages in  Europe and the US, which tightened the supplies.
Fuel oil Fuel Oil (FO) cracks were weak at the beginning of the year  on tepid bunker demand, but picked up in the second half  on low outright prices and improving bunker demand.
Crude differentials Arab Light – Heavy crude differentials widened marginally  to $ 4.3/bbl in FY 2014-15 as compared to $ 4.2/bbl in  the previous year.
Heavier crudes, particularly from Latin  American sources continue to be available with incremental  light oil supply in North America.
While new refineries  getting built are increasingly complex and require heavy  crudes as feedstock, crude production increase is more on  the lighter side over the next few years leading to possibly  narrowing of Light-Heavy differentials in the medium term.
RIL continued to outperform regional benchmarks RIL refining margins outperformed Singapore benchmark  yet again, with a premium of $ 2.3/bbl over the benchmark  during FY 2014-15.
Relative performance versus  benchmarks was built on advantaged configuration to  secure higher value product yields, wider selection of  crudes, operational efficiency and record throughputs.
Strong margins in the second half of the year and lower  energy costs were the key drivers for record earnings.
However, fall in oil prices impacted the value of the  inventories, as seen in lower margins for the third quarter.

RIL is looking at an accelerated commissioning of the  project which is set to deliver a quantum, reduction in the  energy costs.
PETROCHEMICALS RIL is among the world’s largest producers of  petrochemicals with global scale capacities across the  polymer and polyester chain.
Vertical integration from  oil & gas to refining and downstream petrochemical  products is among RIL ’s key competitive advantage.
This  provides RIL feedstock security, scalability and economies  of scale.
RIL is the pre-eminent petrochemical company in  India with a product portfolio spanning across polymers,  polyester, fibre intermediates, elastomers and chemicals.
The deep integration within each chain helps RIL mitigate  the impact of price volatility in the global energy and  chemical industry.
RIL also has a diversified feedstock  slate, with both naphtha and gas based crackers, which  helps to mitigate risk involved with different feedstock  cycles.
World-scale capacities and integration help RIL in  achieving industry-leading profitability with enhanced  stability.
RIL constantly focuses on technology, cost improvements  and safe practices, while continuing to invest in new  growth opportunities.
RIL believes that this strategy is also  important in maintaining domestic market leadership  in its major product lines and is a source of competitive  advantage.
Market environment and outlook FY 2014-15 provided the petrochemical industry with  both challenges and opportunities.
The steep decline  in global energy prices during the second half of the  year was compounded by increased supply from the  US markets, leading to a sharp decline in petrochemical  feedstock and product prices.
The impact of the steep  drop in commodity petrochemical prices was felt across  the petrochemical chain and resulted in significant  destocking for the industry in 3Q FY 2014-15.
However,  stabilisation of product prices at lower levels is likely to  aid a faster revival of demand growth.
Petrochemical  consumption is correlated to global economic growth.
Improving macro-economic activity levels is likely to drive  demand for petrochemical end uses that encompass most  consumer goods, such as appliances, electronics and  automobiles; construction or industrial uses as solvents,  coatings as well as packaging.
Olefins and Polymers Ethylene and propylene are the key petrochemical  raw materials used in manufacturing of polymers, like  Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene (PE), Polyvinyl chloride  (PVC) and chemicals like ethylene oxide and ethylene  glycols.
Global demand for ethylene increased by 3.2% y-o-y to  137 MMT in 2014.
Global ethylene operating rates, which  are indicative of the margin environment, improved  marginally on a y-o-y basis to 87.8% in 2014, sustaining  above the five-year average of 86.7%.
Global ethylene supply/demand 2014 Production by feedstock Demand by end use Production : 137 MMT Demand : 137 MMT Naphtha 46% PE 61% Ethane 35% Ethylene Oxide 15% Propane 9% EDC 10% Butane 5% EBZ 6% Others 5% Others 8% Source: IHS Northeast Asia and North America remain the world’s  largest ethylene producing regions.
However, recent large  investments in the Middle East have propelled this region  into the group of the largest-producing regions, and it  has now surpassed West Europe in respect to ethylene  production.
The low cost position of the US Gulf Coast,  due to the ethane advantage that has developed over the  past several years, with increasing shale gas production,  is resulting in new grassroots steam cracker investments.
Mostly, propylene is produced as a co-product in steam  crackers or a by-product in refineries.
Feedstock changes  and/or utilisation rate changes impacts propylene  production.
RIL produces a large part of propylene as a by- product of refinery, which helps the Company to take full  advantage from refinery integration.
Propylene demand is  dominated by polypropylene production.
Polypropylene  is expected to remain the largest propylene derivative,  and has historically grown at very high rates due to its low  cost and versatility.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited Asian cracker operating rates were higher in FY 2014-15  with an improvement in naphtha cracking fundamentals  and a healthy demand environment.
Lower crude oil prices impacted the ethylene cash cost  curve as naphtha prices tracked crude lower during the  second half of FY 2014-15.
This improved the cash cost  economics of liquid based crackers, as against crackers  based on other feedstock, resulting in a flattening of the  global ethylene cash cost curve.
Lower crude prices are  also impacting the competitiveness of coal-to-chemicals  plants with erosion of the spread between coal and oil  prices.
While North American gas cracking is still at the  low end of the cost curve, the reduced margins could lead  to a more evenly distributed build-out of ethane based  crackers with some already announced (but not yet under  construction) projects being pushed out.
Global thermoplastics market in 2014 was estimated at  224 MMT.
PE accounted for 38%, PP 26% and PVC 18%,  of  the market.
Demand for these polymers (PE, PP , PVC) grew  by 3.8% during 2014 driven by Indian subcontinent, North  East Asia (NEA), South East Asia (SEA) and the Middle East.

Globally, propane prices were also  under pressure this year due to increased exports from the  US with start-up of new propane export terminals.
Average naphtha prices in Asia were lower in FY 2014- 15 due to ample supply and drop in crude oil prices.
However, from 2Q FY 2014-15 naphtha prices firmed up  due to higher gasoline cracks, increased demand from  NEA/SEA and refinery turnarounds.
On a y-o-y basis  ethylene prices were down by 5% and lagged the decline  in feedstock naphtha prices, which was down 18% during  the same period.
Ethylene prices rebounded in 4Q FY  2014-15, due to supply constraints and improved demand.
Ethylene supply in Asia is likely to stay tight due to limited  incremental supplies.

On a y-o-y basis, PP deltas improved sharply as  decline in propylene prices (with lower downstream  activity in China in a well-supplied market) was sharper  than the decline in polypropylene prices, which were  supported by firm demand.
PE delta also remained strong  on a y-o-y basis as feedstock prices tracked falling crude  oil price.
Relatively higher ethylene prices compared to  naphtha helped in supporting High Density Poly Ethylene  (HDPE) prices, resulting in high HDPE-Naphtha deltas.
Polyester and Fibre Intermediates Polyester: Polyester markets faced challenges during the  year as feedstock volatility was accentuated by capacity  additions, which were significantly ahead of demand  growth.
As with other hydrocarbon chains, prices for  feedstock and final products witnessed a steep decline  during the year, with price declines ranging from 12-41%.

In addition to the overcapacity in the filament  yarn segment, higher raw material cost and consequent  declining margins during the first half forced producers  to rationalise operations.
During the third quarter, raw  material costs saw a decline with the steep drop in energy  prices.
While polyester fibre and yarn prices were also  lower by ~25% from their peak in June 2014, the lag in  price drops supported polyester deltas.
FY 2014-15  margins of Partially Oriented Yarn (POY) and Polyester  Staple Fibre (PSF) were higher by 20% on y-o-y basis.
Cotton production of 26.3 MMT in FY 2014-15 remained  higher than consumption for the fifth consecutive  season.
Along with this, the Chinese policy of limiting  cotton purchases for the year weighed on prices which  ended 23% lower than last year.
However, with the steep  drop in polyester prices towards the later part of the  year, polyester v/s cotton price difference stayed above  long-term levels, at $ 500/MT, mitigating the threat of  substitution in blends.
The outlook for the coming year is favourable for polyester  as the declining cotton prices globally has discouraged  cotton farming in major cotton growing countries,  leading to a lower cotton acreage for the next season.
This could lead to production falling below consumption  for the first time in five years and support cotton prices.
Indian polyester demand is expected to reach a level of   around 6 MMT, at a CAGR of around 8 % by end of 2020.
Global PET markets witnessed a series of new capacity  additions during the year amounting to 1.5 MMT,  compared to lower demand growth of 0.6 MMT.
Overall  market balance weakened even though some capacities  were taken off for extended periods especially in China.
Prices during the year declined steadily apart from a short  spurt during second quarter, average prices for the year  were 15% lower than last year.
Margins however improved  in the second half of the year amid the drop in feedstock  costs and ended the year 5% higher on a y-o-y basis.
In  most emerging markets, demand was strong reflecting  better consumer spending.
Several countries started anti- dumping investigations against China.
Europe withdrew  an agreement with Indian producers, resulting in higher  anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties from India.
The use  of food grade Recycled PET (RPET) increased in the US  and Europe, amid new capacity addition.
But with prices  of virgin PET dropping, the use of recycled content as a  choice becomes difficult.
Fibre intermediates: During the year, overcapacity in the  fibre intermediate markets led to a decline in prices and  margins.
Paraxylene (PX) demand uncertainty, along with  capacity anticipations, kept markets cautious and contract  prices remained unsettled for most part of the year.
Deltas continued to be above break-even levels though  they were 27% lower than previous year.
PX witnessed a  bunching up of capacity additions during the second half  of the year, with 4.7 MMT total additions during the year  compared to demand growth of 1.4 MMTPA.
The Chinese PTA markets have witnessed large capacity  addition during the past years, changing market dynamics  significantly.
Poor margins forced producers to shut down  unviable plants or implement production rationalisation.
The average PTA prices during the year declined by  20% from that of last year.
Delta continued to be under  pressure due to the overcapacity and averaged at   $ 108/MT as against $ 117/MT in the previous year.
Mono-Ethylene Glycol (MEG) markets were largely guided  by the upstream markets and co-feedstock PTA demand  patterns.
The average MEG prices during the year declined  by 13% from that of last year and average deltas were  lower by 6% on a year on year basis.

Continuing  volatility and declining feedstock prices led to cautious  buying.
Butadiene: During 2014, the global capacity of butadiene  was at 14.5 MMTPA with 76.4% operating rate.
Demand  saw subdued growth of 5.2% y-o-y, driven by synthetic  rubber demand primarily catering to the automobile  industry.
SBR and PBR markets in Asia were weak in 2014  and demand is yet to recover.
Most butadiene consuming  plants in Asia, especially China have been operating at  reduced rates due to weaker downstream demand.
This  has put pressure on butadiene prices, resulting in severe  margin erosion for butadiene manufacturers towards the  end of the year.
PBR: Demand for PBR is largely driven by growth in  the automobile sector.
The global automobile industry  grew by 3% to reach 86.9 million units in 2014.
Global  PBR consumption for FY 2014-15 remained weak and  is expected to grow at 5% in 2015.
Significant capacity  addition in China during 2014, coupled with the slowdown  in global economy kept the operating rates of PBR plants  at lower levels (~67%).
Major manufacturers in China and  Korea, operated plants at lower rates of 40-50% due to  weak regional demand.
Domestic Scenario Polymers: India’s polymer market growth enjoys high  correlation with the country’s GDP growth.
In the last five  years, the country’s per capita plastic consumption has  outpaced its GDP growth, making India among the world’s  fastest growing polymer markets with a five-year CAGR of  7.1% (2009-2014).
Despite strong growth over the last few  decades, the domestic market remains under-penetrated  compared to other Asian developing countries.
In India, polymer demand continued to be healthy  during FY 2014-15, also supported by lower absolute  prices towards the end of the year.
During FY 2014-15,  India’s polymer demand was higher by 6.7%.
PP demand  grew by 8.1% y-o-y with improved demand from raffia  packaging, nonwoven, multi filament, automotive,  hygiene applications and appliances sector.
PE demand  was higher by 6.3% due to firm demand from film  packaging, moulded products (i.e.
FMCG, pharma and  food packaging), and paper/woven sacks lamination  packaging sector.
PVC domestic demand was higher by  5.4% with higher demand from pipe and fitting sector.
Overall, with improving business sentiment and a revival  in investment cycle, demand is likely to see higher growth  in the medium term.
Polyester and Fibre Intermediates: Feedstock fluctuations  in the international markets and the steep drop in the  latter part of the year led to cautious buying behaviour  by the industry.
In addition, severe cash crunch and  longer cash cycles resulted in need-based buying.
Overall  polyester demand increased by 7% during the year,  led by Fully Drawn Yarn (FDY) and PET.
Overall growth  was constrained by high volatility of prices and reduced  liquidity with customers.
FDY witnessed healthy growth from warp knitting  segments, while PET witnessed stable growth owing to  delayed monsoons during the first half.
Shipments during  the second half were limited on account of the price  volatility and lean season.
Domestic cotton production increased during the  seasonal year, owing to higher acreage, making India  the largest producer globally.
The high production has  resulted in prices dropping by 20% during the year, as the  exports to China also declined.
Indian polyester industry will be in advantageous  position with growth of consumer demand and strong  manufacturing base enabling India to serve as regional  polyester manufacturing hub.
Elastomers Indian butadiene demand grew by ~43% to 171 KTPA as  against an installed capacity of 435 KTPA, making it a net  exporter in the global markets.
Domestic demand growth  increase was primarily driven by additional capacities in  downstream synthetic rubber plants.
India’s demand for PBR in 2014 is around 191 KT and is  expected to grow at 8% annually in the medium term.
India is a net importer of PBR and is likely to remain an  importer even after start-up of announced capacity  addition in 2017-18.
RIL has successfully commercialised  its new PBR plant, effectively reducing imports and  increasing its domestic market share.

To meet the increasing  domestic demand, RIL is setting up a new 1.4 MMTPA  ethylene cracker (ROGC) along with downstream PE  capacity of 1 MMTPA at Jamnagar.
The cracker will  use refinery off gases as feedstock which will provide  competitive cost advantage and feedstock flexibility to  the petrochemicals business.
The new ROGC cracker is also  integrated with downstream MEG to have chain  margin  advantage of its in-house consumption in polyester chain.
The new cracker is likely to be among the world’s largest  ethylene crackers and will secure the benefits of economies  of scale.
This is the first cracker based entirely on refinery  off gases, leveraging the scale of RIL ’s refining complex at  Jamnagar, and as such is not replicable.
ROGC will have  one of the largest ethylene derivative plants including  swing polyethylene (with metallocene capability), LDPE  and MEG.
Additionally, by virtue of integration with Company’s  existing refineries at the same site, the plant will be in  the top decile in terms of global cost competitiveness  on an integrated basis and for all new capacity being  built.
Currently, ROGC project is in an advanced stage  of execution.
Renowned EPC companies with global  1.4 MMTPA refinery off-gas cracker to be among  the world’s largest ethylene crackers 02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 61 reach including Fluor, Bechtel, Technip, Tecnimont,  Foster Wheeler, Linde, Jacobs and Aker are executing  engineering and construction from various locations.
Majority of engineering deliverables for procurement and  construction have been issued.
RIL is also undertaking  debottlenecking activities for PP at Jamnagar which is  likely to augment capacity by 60 KTPA.
As a part of providing feedstock flexibility and long-term  supply security to existing crackers, RIL initiated projects  for imports of ethane from the US.
This will ensure long- term feedstock competitiveness.
RIL is implementing a  project to source 1.5 MMTPA of Ethane from US to feed  its crackers in India.
It has executed storage and capacity  agreements for liquefaction and export of ethane with a  North American Terminal.
RIL has ordered six state-of-the- art Very Large Ethane Carriers (VLECs) which will be the  largest vessels ever built in the world.
For construction  supervision, RIL has entered into agreements with one  of the world’s largest and reputed shipping companies  Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines, Ltd (MOL).The ships are expected   to be delivered starting last quarter of 2016.
MOL will also operate and manage the vessels after they  built and deliver.
Ethane import from the US will start from  the first quarter of 2017.
RIL ’s petrochemical capacity additions are aimed at  serving growing Indian consumption and will further  strengthen its leadership position in the large growing  domestic market.
Post completion of petrochemical expansion plans, RIL  is likely to be among the top 10 global petrochemical  producers by capacity and earnings potential.
The expansions are world-scale and use state-of-the- art technology, which ensures advantageous cost of  operations alongside savings in packing and logistic costs.
Being strategically located close to the consumption  centres, allows for easy access and benefits the targeted  markets with an economical and reliable source of raw  materials.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION Reliance’s upstream business encompasses the complete  chain of activity from acquisition to exploration,  development and production of hydrocarbons.
Reliance  has an advantageous position in offshore (deep-water)  capabilities, coupled with the knowledge of operations  in unconventional areas such as CBM and shale gas.
More  specifically it:  Has strong offshore capabilities in India   Has a strategic partnership with BP in the domestic  upstream business   Can leverage existing infrastructure, knowledge and  experience    Has achieved materiality in the unconventional shale  gas business  Has a balanced portfolio with growth potential Market environment and outlook With the fall in oil prices, many US producers have  responded to the situation by cutting back on drilling  activity and rig counts have dropped by nearly 50%,  since their peak in October 2014.
The fall in rig count will,  however, start impacting the US oil production only from  the second half of 2015.
For the US gas markets, FY 2014-15 started with strong  gas prices on the strength of record low gas inventories.
This was followed by a milder-than-expected summer  and continuously increasing production levels resulting in  record injection to the storage.
This period also witnessed  new infrastructure coming on line, particularly in Marcellus  and Utica region, and thus, the US gas production reached  a record high of 73.5 BCF/D in December 2014, a 5 BCF/D  y-o-y increase.
This resulted in softening of gas prices  towards the end of the year.
However, the long-term  fundamentals of gas market remain intact.
Over 22 BCF/D  of take-away capacities are being planned that would  help gas off-take.
Gulf Coast demand remains strong  and is expected to go further up with commencement of  Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports and other industrial  facilities, along with higher gas export to Mexico.
In  addition, capex cut by producers, will also cut some of  the associated gas production.
These are likely to have  favourable impact on long term gas prices.
According to research estimates, nearly 3 billion barrels of  global oil reserves remain challenged if oil price remains  below $ 70/bbl.
The projects most at risk are in oil sands,  deep water, ultra-deep water, arctic and some shale oil  plays.
Estimates of global exploration and production  capital expenditure show a fall from $ 870 billion in 2014  to nearly $ 680 billion in 2015, about 22% decline.
The  steepest fall is being experienced in North America, where  the capital expenditure programme has fallen by 34%.
Of the $ 680 billion spend on upstream development, IHS  CERA estimates that offshore capex plans will be lower by  10% and are likely to touch $ 180 billion globally by 2015.
Deep and ultra-deep projects account for nearly a 22% of  total global costs and deep-water day rates are declining  with lower fleet utilisation levels and idle rigs.
Typically,  there is a 15-18 months lag before costs fully respond.
The share of gas in India’s energy mix as per the BP  statistical review is 8%.
This is modest by international  norms since the global average mix is about 23%.
India’s  future gas demand is expected to touch 224 Million  Metric Standard Cubic Meter per Day (MMSCMD) by 2020.
(Source: IEA’s WEO 2014 publication) In October, 2014 the Government notified the New  Domestic Natural Gas Price Guidelines, 2014.
The new  pricing guideline applicable to most of the natural gas  produced in India uses a formula consisting of US Henry  Hub, UK National Balancing Point, Canadian Alberta and  Russian gas prices to arrive at the domestic gas price.

This was  largely on account of decline in production and lower  crude oil price realisation.
EBIT for the year declined by  23.1% on y-o-y basis to ` 1,250 crore on account of the  lower realisations with no commensurate reduction in cost.
During the year, RIL opted to relinquish two blocks KG- DWN-2003/1 and CY-PR-DWN-2001/3 as part of the  ongoing effort to high grade its upstream asset portfolio.
In KG-DWN-2003/1 further progress in petroleum  operations were impeded by defence restrictions imposed  in October 2012.
Since then the JV had continued to seek  unrestricted access to the block without success.
RIL and  its JV partners finally decided to relinquish the block in  line with Government’s policy.
The decision was approved  by the Management Committee (MC) in the meeting held  in December 2014.
CY-PR-DWN-2001/3 was relinquished  as prospectivity was not commensurate with the high  geological risk involved.
Based on this formula, domestic gas prices in the period from November 2014 to March 2015 were set at $ 5.05/MMBTU  on Gross Calorific Value basis.
Business and Competitive position The Company’s assets include KG-D6, Panna-Mukta, Tapti and two CBM blocks in addition to several domestic and  international blocks.
RIL also has three joint ventures in North American shale plays with Pioneer Natural Resources,  Chevron and Carrizo.

KG-D6 gas production declined by 12% for the year to  157.6 BCF.
Fall in production was mainly due to natural  decline in the fields coupled with partial shutdown of  MA field due to Hudhud cyclone and the fire in East- West pipeline during the year.
This was partly offset by  incremental production from side tracks in well MA6H and  MA5H.
In FY 2014-15, Panna-Mukta fields produced 7.2 MMBBL  of crude, a reduction of 2 % on y-o-y basis and 70.7 BCF of  natural gas, a growth of 8.1% on y-o-y basis.
The increase  in production was on account of incremental gains from  existing wells and effective well intervention activities.
This was partly offset by a decrease in production due  to unplanned shutdowns during the year, including the  shutdown in July 2014 on account of integrity issue with  South Bassein Hazira Trunk (SBHT) coupled with natural  decline.
Gas production at the Tapti fields declined by 48% on a  y-o-y basis.
The decrease is due to natural decline, and  field is progressing towards cessation of production.
International business Reliance’s E&P strategy is to balance the portfolio by  expanding its international asset base and investing in  regimes having attractive internationally competitive  terms.
A number of opportunities are under review.
Updates:   RIL and Myanma Oil & Gas Enterprise (MOGE), an  enterprise of the Government of Myanmar, have  signed production sharing contracts for two offshore  blocks (M17 and M18).
RIL won both the offshore  blocks, after its bids in Myanmar offshore block  bidding round – 2013 were declared successful by the  Ministry of Energy (MoE) of the Republic of the Union  of Myanmar.
RIL signed a MoU with Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX)  to co-operate for assessment of potential upstream oil  and gas business opportunities in Mexico and jointly  evaluate value-added opportunities in international  markets.
North American Shale Gas Operations Background The shale gas industry in the US has emerged as one of the  most cost competitive and agile among upstream basins  using state-of-the-art technology to continuously improve  productivity and reduce cost.
As a result, the sector has  consistently seen the entry of new players and production  has continued to grow at a steady pace.
North America  remains market friendly with cutting-edge technology  and nimbleness to respond to market challenges with  innovative technical and business solutions.
Reliance has partnerships with strong operators who  have a proven track record and so far has invested $ 7.9  billion of Capex in its joint ventures with Pioneer Natural  Resources, Carrizo and Chevron including investments in  EFS midstream.

Reliance’s share of net sales volume was  at 168 BCFe, compared to 131 BCFe in 2013.
EBITDA of  $775.1 million in 2014 was up 26% y-o-y.
Business gained  materiality in terms of production, revenue and EBITDA.
The shale gas business effectively managed the sharp  downturn in commodity prices, and high gas differentials,  particularly in Marcellus region.
WTI oil prices dropped  40% from $ 90/bbl at the beginning of the year to   $ 53/bbl by the end of the year.
Henry Hub gas prices  remained higher at $ 4.43/MMBTU during CY 2014,  compared to the average of $ 3.65/MMBTU in CY 2013,  though declined during the year’s second half.
Operationally, the business continued its strong  performance during CY 2014, with production reaching  record levels across JVs.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited JVs successfully implemented various value creation  initiatives that resulted in increased well count, improved  well productivity and reduced well costs.
These initiatives  significantly add to the long-term profitability and  sustainability of the business.
The business has reached  an overall development maturity (with a significant part  of the acreages held by production) and this provides  adequate investment flexibility in managing the low  price environment through prioritising well capex in the  most prolific areas.
Gross JV Production average at ~1.2 BCFe/d reflecting a growth of 26% over CY 2013 Eagle Ford shale remains one of the most competitive  liquid shale plays in the US and is better positioned to  remain competitive even in a volatile price environment.
Pioneer JV continued implementation of better  completion technologies, which has demonstrated  improved well performance.
Similarly, down spacing  efforts progressed well and is improving the potential  well count for the JV.
Further, the Pioneer JV successfully  decreased Drilling & Completion (D&C) costs through  initiatives like use of 2-string casing design and efficient  pad operations.
This improved efficiency, greatly helped  managing the depressed oil price environment.
The Marcellus shale area continued to see sustained  growth in production with some of the best-in-class gas  wells, and continued to contribute significantly to the gas  production growth of the US.
This growth also resulted  in some pricing pressure leading to increased gas price  differentials.
Carrizo and Chevron, the two Marcellus  JVs, remained focused on maintaining competitive cost  structure and worked on reducing well costs and lease  operating expenses.
All three JVs actively pursued opex and capex reduction  initiatives in the current commodity price downturn.
The overall capex during the year was $ 1.2 billion, lower  by 14% over the previous year on account of moderated  development pace at Marcellus, and cost efficiency  achieved in drilling and completion activities across the  JVs.
With NEPA initial development maturing there was  slow capex momentum.
Cumulative capex across all  JVs including investment in EFS Midstream LLC stood  at $ 7.9 billion.
Substantial part of Pioneer JV capex was  met through cash from JV operations, while Carrizo JV  was cash positive from operations in 2014.
Chevron JV  continued to account for most of the ongoing capex and  funding needs.
In 2014, the joint ventures drilled 211 wells and put 225  wells on production, taking the cumulative number  of producing wells to 838 at the end of the year.
Improvement in efficiencies, improving well recovery and  cost reductions in development activities for 2014 over  the previous year was a key success area during the year.

In CY 2014, year-end proved reserves stood at 2.95  Trillion Cubic Feet equivalent (TCFe) for Reliance-SGO  reflecting 11% growth in reserve accretion over CY 2013.
These proved reserves are about 33% of total resource  base.
Reserves were positively impacted by benefits of  additional well locations in Pioneer and Carrizo joint  ventures, marking development upside.
Pioneer Upstream JV JV successfully pursued further high-value growth.
Producing well count increased from 371 at year-end 2013  to 499 at year-end 2014, which was a major factor in the  growth in production volumes.
The JV produced 250 BCFe  of products through the year (gross) and achieved net  sales of 98.3 BCFe.
The share of liquids increased to 68%  in 2014, reflecting growth in activity in oil-rich acreage.
Ongoing development thrust on infill drilling and down  spaced wells in Lower Eagle Ford and Middle Eagle Ford  provided for additional potential locations leading to  growth in proved reserves by 12% at year-end 2014.
Chevron Upstream JV The JV production stood at 122 BCFe, reflecting growth of  over 25% from the previous year and achieved net sales  of 42.2 BCFe.
Growth of 13% also witnessed in proved  reserves from year-end 2013 to year-end 2014.
JV is  pursuing paced development in view of the challenging  pricing environment, while working on various operational  and cost efficiency improvement initiatives to maximise  well recovery and decrease well cost.

The JV production of 56 BCFe reflected a  39% increase over the previous year with net sales volume  of 27.1 BCFe for 2014.
Carrizo JV opted for deferment  of drilling activities to CY 2016, considering the price  environment.
While year-end 2014 reserves were largely  unchanged, Carrizo added potential well locations due to  Upper Marcellus development plan down spacing.
Capex and growth plans KG-D6 Appraisal of MJ1 discovery RIL along with JV partners made a significant hydrocarbon  discovery in FY 2013-14, called ‘D-55’ in well MJ1 drilled  in the block KG-D6 situated in the Krishna Godavari basin.
As a part of the appraisal programme, three appraisal wells  have been drilled to date, of which two appraisal wells  were drilled in FY 2014-15.
All the appraisal wells have  provided vital information on the extent and potential of  the reservoir.
In addition, enhanced imaging for reservoir  characterisation is underway and the first phase of  conceptual engineering has been completed.
This will  be followed by further engineering to develop a robust  scheme of exploitation.
Based on these appraisal efforts  the JV expects to submit the Declaration of Commerciality   (DoC) in the second half of FY 2015-16.
R-Cluster Development  The Field Development Plan (FDP) for the R-Cluster  discoveries was submitted in January 2013 and it was  approved by the MC in August 2013.
Since the approval  of the FDP , the KG-D6 JV has made significant progress  towards development of the discovery.

Production augmentation efforts in existing producing  fields (D1, D3 and D26)   D1-D3 field continues to produce from eight wells.
To maximise the recovery from the field, well  intervention jobs were planned for execution in  phases.
In the initial phase, Water Shut-off (WSO)  jobs in three wells were attempted.
Although, the  outcome of these jobs did not meet expectations, the  data acquired from these wells and the lessons learnt  have been incorporated in designing the side track  jobs in the next phase of well intervention jobs   Reservoir top-set drilling of a substitute well has been  completed, and further drilling, completions and  connections are planned to be undertaken during FY  2015-16.
Besides, side track activities are planned and  well options have been prioritised to undertake these  jobs   Meanwhile, as part of the Onshore Terminal Booster  Compressor (OTBC) project, two compressors have  been successfully commissioned, with the third  compressor expected to be commissioned in first  half of FY 2015-16.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited   Mobilisation of rig for work-over of 15 wells (of  which five wells completed) and for drilling of six  development wells at Mukta-B Mukta-B development project is at an advanced stage  of completion.
Scheduled completion of facilities is  expected in the first quarter of FY 2015-16.
Drilling of six  development wells is scheduled to commence during the  first quarter of FY 2015-16 and first oil is expected in the  subsequent quarter.
Tapti Tapti JV production level has steadily declined this year  as it is nearing the end of its economic life.
The field  is currently producing around 1 MMSCMD of gas.
The  cessation of production is likely to happen during the  second half of FY 2015-16.
In line with the production sharing contract, RIL along  with its partners have issued an abandonment notice to  the Government in December 2013 and started allocating  funds for site restoration activity.
Post cessation of production, ONGC as a Government  nominee will take over the process facilities and the export  pipelines for its Daman development project.
As part of  the site restoration of Tapti block, Tapti JV will commence  necessary decommissioning and abandonment activities  (the first of its kind in India’s E&P industry) for the balance  of the facilities in the coming year.
Other NELP Blocks NEC-25 No significant development has taken place in this block  during the year.
RIL continues to wait for the approval of  its Integrated Block Development Plan for the discoveries  (D32, D40) and approval of proposal for conducting Drill  Stem Testing (DST) for D32 and D40 from the regulator.
CY-D5  Post notification of discovery of S1 well (D56), the  appraisal programme has been reviewed by MC.
The  period of appraisal programme is valid up to August  2016.
Subsequent to completion of exploration phase  II, RIL along with its partner has opted not to enter the  phase-III of exploration and also decided not to submit a  development plan for discovery D35, for which the DoC  has been reviewed earlier.
CB-10 The block was awarded under the NELP-V licensing round  and is the only conventional on-land block operated by  RIL.
Post completion of phase-1 of the exploration period,  wherein RIL made eight discoveries out of 18 wells drilled  in this block, the Government has approved RIL and its  partner to enter into phase-II of the exploration in January  2015.
RIL has extensive plans towards drilling to explore  and augment additional resources.
During the year, the DoC of eight discoveries was reviewed  by the MC.
RIL along with its JV partner is actively engaged  in preparation of development plan for submission by mid  of FY 2015-16.
CBM (Sohagpur East and Sohagpur West)  Development Project Based on extensive exploration activity, the development  plan was submitted to DGH for both blocks and approved  by DGH in November 2007.
The development plan  envisages 1,000 wells to be executed in a phased manner  over the contract period.
Development activities have commenced in the two  CBM blocks (Sohagpur East and West) with all requisite  approvals required for the development stage in place.
As a part of the project scope, RIL is drilling more than 200  wells and setting up two gas gathering stations and eight  water gathering stations in phase-I.
The land acquisition  for phase-I wells and facilities is near completion.
Out  of phase-I scope, RIL has drilled 168 surface holes, 153  production holes and completed hydro fracturing jobs  for 120 wells.
Detailed engineering and procurement  for sub-surface and surface facilities are completed.
Installation and erection of most of the equipment is  nearing completion.
Installation of well-site facilities is  completed for two trunk lines.
Laying of gas gathering and  water gathering network is under progress.
The first gas  production is expected in the second half of FY 2015-16.
Shahdol – Phulpur gas pipeline project Reliance Gas Pipeline Limited, a subsidiary of RIL, is  building a natural gas pipeline from Shahdol in Madhya  Pradesh to Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh (hook-up point with  GAIL ’s HVJ pipeline), to transport gas from its CBM blocks.
Land acquisition has been completed for all critical  installations.
Right to Use (RoU) for 261 km out of 302  km is handed over to pipeline construction contractors.
Basic engineering (FEED) and detailed engineering are  completed.
Ordering for all long lead and other items  has been completed.

Update on domestic gas pricing, arbitration and  other legal issues Domestic Gas Pricing In October 2013, Cabinet Committee on Economic  Affairs (CCEA) approved a new gas pricing formula for a  period of five years based on the recommendation of the  Rangarajan Committee Report on ‘The Production Sharing  Contract Mechanism in Petroleum Industry’ .
The Domestic  Natural Gas Pricing Guideline, 2014 were notified by the  Government on 10th January, 2014.
The price under the  02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 67 new formula was to be applicable from 1 st April, 2014,  including the gas produced from block KG-DWN-98/3  (’KG-D6 Block’) where the previous approved price expired  on 31st March, 2014.
The gas price under these guidelines  was to be notified by the Government by March 2014.
There was continued delay on the part of the Government  in notifying the price in accordance with the approved  formula.
RIL, BP and NIKO issued a Notice of Arbitration  on 9th May, 2014 to the Government of India, seeking  the implementation of the ‘Domestic Natural Gas  Pricing Guideline 2014’ notified on 10th January, 2014,  while preserving their rights to claim an arms-length  market price as required under the Production Sharing   Contract (PSC).
On 18 th October, 2014, in supersession of its earlier  notification of 10 th January, 2014, the Government  notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Price Guidelines  2014.
In view of RIL, the methodology used for valuation  of gas under these guidelines, does not reflect true arms- length market price of gas in India as required under the  production sharing contract signed with the Government.
Without prejudice to any of its rights and contentions, RIL  is complying with the guidelines.
KG-D6 Arbitration and other legal issues RIL sought Government’s confirmation that no action  was being planned following news reports that the  Government may curtail the Company’s entitlement to  recover its costs on the basis of there being a shortfall  in production from levels specified in the development  plan.
According to the Company the PSC permits full ‘cost  recovery’ of its costs of exploration, development and  production from the value of petroleum produced from  the KG-D6 Block.
RIL on behalf of all contractor constituents - namely Niko  (NECO) Limited (NIKO) and BP Exploration Alpha Limited  (‘BP‘) (together, the ’Claimants‘) served an arbitration  notice on the Government on 23rd November, 2011  (‘Cost Recovery Arbitration‘).
Both the Claimants and  the Government have appointed arbitrators and on 23rd  September, 2014, the Supreme Court nominated Hon’ble  Michael Kirby AC CMG as the presiding third arbitrator.
Justice Kirby is corresponding with the parties.
Three public interest litigations have been filed before the  Supreme Court of India against the Company in relation to  the production sharing contract for KG-D6 Block seeking  substantially similar reliefs in the nature of; (i) disallowance  of cost recovery under the production sharing contract for  KG-D6 Block; (ii) quashing the Government’s decision to  approve the certain gas price formula, and (iii) termination  of production sharing contract for KG-D6 Block on the  basis that the Company has not achieved the committed  production.
In the views of both the Company and the  Government, point (ii) in the public interest litigation no  longer survives in view of the revised pricing guidelines  issued by the government on 1st November, 2014 and being  a matter of arbitration.
Petitioners have also requested the  Supreme Court to stay the Cost Recovery Arbitration.
The  Company has submitted that the underlying issues which  have been flagged by the Petitioners are already subject  matter of Cost Recovery Arbitration and the Gas Price  Arbitration and the same need to be heard by the arbitral  tribunal.
PMT Arbitration In December 2010, the Company and BG Exploration  and Production India Limited (together, the ’Claimants‘)  referred a number of disputes, differences and claims  arising under two Production Sharing Contracts entered  into in 1994 among the Claimants, Oil & Natural Gas  Corporation Limited (ONCG) and the Government (the  ’PSCs‘) to arbitration.
The disputes relate to, among  other things, the limits of cost recovery, profit sharing  and audit and accounting provisions of the PSCs.
The  value of the Claimants’ claims exceeds $ 500 million.
The Government’s defence dated 31st January 2012  raised certain jurisdictional objections and asserted a  number of substantial counterclaims, including claims for  underpayment of profits and failure to complete agreed  work programmes.
The parties agreed by consent that the juridical seat of the  arbitration would be London, England.
Following an initial merits hearing in May 2012, the  Tribunal passed a number of final partial awards, largely  in the Claimants’ favour.
The Government challenged the  Tribunal’s awards/determinations under Part I of the Indian  Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 before the Hon’ble  Delhi High Court.
These challenges were ultimately  dismissed after the Claimants prevailed in a Special Leave  Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 28th  May 2014.
The Government filed a Review Petition before  the Supreme Court against this judgement, which was  unsuccessful, and also filed a Curative Petition before the  Supreme Court seeking reconsideration of the judgment  which was also dismissed.
ONGC, another constituent  of Contractor under the PSCs but is not a party to the  arbitration (as ONGC was directed by the Government  of India at the inception to be bound by any award and  not to participate in the arbitration) has now filed an  intervention application in the disposed off Government  SLP on the basis that there are certain factual and legal  errors in the judgement and ONGC needs to present its  position before the court.
The matter is presently sub- judice.
Government has filed another SLP , copy of which is  yet to be served upon the Company.
The Tribunal is yet to set a date to hear the parties’ closing  submissions, which was deferred due to the illness of  Government nominated Arbitrator.

RETAIL BUSINESS Market environment and outlook Twenty-first century India reflects the potential to  withstand challenges and emerge as a significant  contributor to the global economy.
Aspirations and  capabilities of over a billion people are creating a huge  market for both domestic and global investment.
India is the world’s fifth largest retail market (Source:  Retailing-Sector-Analysis-Report by Equity Master  November 2014).
There are several favourable factors at  an interplay, which are driving consumption boom in the  Indian market.
Favourable demographics, urbanisation  and rising education levels are affecting growth in  incomes, and increasing spending power is translating  further into increasing household consumption.
As  incomes rise, the shape of the country’s income pyramid is  also getting transformed.
The cascading effect of wealthier  households, wanting to live an aspirational lifestyle would  further drive India’s consumption boom.
Overall India’s retail business is projected to nearly double  to $ 1 trillion by 2020 from $ 600 billion in 2015.
The retail  market is expected to grow by 12% in line with historical  trends.
(Source: Retail 2020: Retrospect, Reinvent, Rewrite  by BCG and RAI, 2015) Modern trade is expected to grow three times to $ 180  billion by 2020 from $ 60 billion in 2015.
Traditional trade  is projected to grow at 10% annually, while modern trade  is projected to grow at almost twice this pace.
India’s e-commerce market is expected to grow  exponentially over the next five years.
Internet users are  expected to increase three times from ~200 million in 2014  to ~600 million by 2020, due to increased proliferation of  smartphones, lower cost of connectivity and improved  quality and expanded reach in lower tier cities.
Even though, India continues on its current high-growth  path for the long term, the economy is prone to headwinds  in the short run.
The growth path began slowing down in  the last few years, because of low level of macro-economic  activity, caused by high interest rates, rising inflation and  investor pessimism.
Amid escalating food prices, high borrowing rates and  marginal real wage growth, consumers tend to postpone  discretionary spend.
Going forward, the Indian economy is expected to  maintain its growth momentum aided by stronger growth  enabling factors like stress on improved governance,  reforms towards more competitive and market oriented  policies, restructuring of welfare measures aimed at  improving end level benefits.
India’s organised retail would continue to surge as  customers look for an aspirational lifestyle, and are willing  to pay for superior shopping experience and better quality  products at attractive prices.
Retail business and competitive position Operating strategy Reliance Retail is the retail initiative of the group and is  central to Reliance’s consumer facing businesses.
Reliance  Retail leads group’s efforts in enabling inclusion, growth,  opportunity and building sustainable societal value for  millions of Indians.

02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 69 Sector overview Reliance Retail operates in five core format sectors viz.,  Value Formats and others, Fashion and Lifestyle, Digital,  Brands and Jewellery.
Value formats and others Food and grocery constitutes the largest category in  the consumption basket and is estimated at around  60% of consumer spending (Source: Deloitte – Indian  Retail Market Opening More Doors, January 2013).
The  penetration of organised retail is among the lowest in this  category, which creates an unprecedented opportunity  for growth of modern retail.
Value formats offer a comprehensive range of products  ranging from fresh produce, dairy, staples, processed  food, food/non-food FMCG products and much more  to delight customers.
Value formats operate the largest  chain of full service convenience stores, supermarkets and  hypermarkets on a highly integrated supply chain model.
The linkages with the farm has brought about  transformational changes in the quality of life of farmers,  also enhancing the quality of produce, reducing wastage  by shortening the time to move fresh produce and  reducing intermediaries in the value chain, thereby  benefiting all.
Modern grocery retail has evolved in India and so have  the customers.
To remain relevant to weekly and monthly  shopping missions of a household, value formats have  successfully maintained a fine balance of serving local  tastes by offering small brands, as well as national and  international brands.
Value formats have been focusing on own label products  that stand true to the tag-line of ‘Trusted Quality,  Reliance Price’ .
Several new products and categories  were added to the strong own label portfolio.
During the  year, the business recorded a participation of up to 25%  from own label brands in key categories, such as Home  Personal Care and Dairy.
With a broad selection of own  label products, complemented by well-known brands,  value formats optimally meet the diverse needs of Indian  consumers.
Value formats also launched the e-commerce channel  through www.reliancefreshdirect.com.
The site has  received overwhelming response and is still under pilot.
The online channel provides the convenience of delivery  of fresh produce, dairy, packaged food and much more at  the door step.
Reliance Fresh has been included in the list of ‘Most  Trusted’ service brands in India by Brand Equity,   The Economic Times and continues to improve its   position year after year.
This represents the faith of  consumers in patronising the chain, which continues to  remain as India’s largest grocery retailer.
Traditional retail is characterised by the presence of over  12 million kirana shops in the country.
These kirana shops  operate their retail business on a fragmented distribution  network, with presence of a number of intermediaries.
Reliance Market, the wholesale cash-and-carry format  aims at supporting their growth and providing them with  a modern distribution system.
Reliance Market serves traditional kiranas, hotel,  restaurant and catering (HORECA), small and medium  institutions, thereby generating sustained social value.
Reliance Market serves deliveries to kiranas to ensure that  they focus on their business, while it empowers them  with the right merchandise on a timely basis.
In a short  duration, thousands of kiranas have benefited from this  programme and the business continues to enroll and  engage with newer kirana members each day.
Reliance Market has established leadership in wholesale  cash-and-carry segment in the country with 43 operational  stores and enjoys patronage of more than 1.5 million  registered members.
Fashion and lifestyle India’s apparel market is worth around ` 2.3 lakh crore  (Source: Deloitte – Indian Retail Market Opening More  Doors, January 2013), of which the organised sector  accounts for 24% of the overall pie.
The entire market is  growing at a CAGR of 9% with women’s wear and kids’  wear being the fastest growing categories.
Reliance Trends Store With rising disposable income, exposure to western  broadcast media, access to better education and younger  demographics, the fashion and lifestyle sector is poised  for robust growth.

Digital Consumer Durables and Information Technology (CDIT)  is one of the major categories in the consumption basket  that reflects the aspirational lifestyle of India’s consumers.
The sector has been hit by industry slowdown.
To add to  the pain, high interest rates have compelled consumers to  postpone spending on large ticket items to restrict their  family budgets.
The sluggish consumption pattern of digital products  is expected to be a transient phenomenon, as younger  demographic population supported by new job creation  and aspirational lifestyle is likely to bring back industry  demand.
Unabated by the industry impact, Reliance Retail  continued its growth in the digital sector during the  year.
Reliance Digital operates multiple formats, offering  consumer electronics, home appliances, IT and telecom  products.
Reliance Digital, the CDIT products retailing format, has  established itself as a complete destination store that  offers comprehensive assortment of top brands, a large  selection of innovative products, attractive pricing and  best-in-class service.
Reliance Digital Express Store Digital Express Mini is a smaller store format catering to  mobility and communication needs of the consumers.
The rate of opening stores during the year has been on  an accelerated path for Digital Express Mini format.
In  a short period, the format has established itself as the  country’s largest mobile phone retail chain.
The format  is increasingly becoming a distribution platform for  most of the national and international brands as it offers  tremendous reach to over 150 cities in India, with further  plans to take the format to over 800 cities.

Reliance Brands now operates 107 stores for international  brands.
The strong partner portfolio reassures that  Reliance Brands is seen as a partner of choice for  international brands.
Hamleys store in Mumbai Jewellery During the year, jewellery demand remained sluggish  owing to weak macro environment.
Regulatory changes  severely curtailed gold imports, resulting in scarcity and  spiralling cost of imported gold.
The inevitable outcome  was higher gold prices and weak consumer demand.
Reliance Jewels was focused on undertaking several  process improvement initiatives to augment the  customer experience in the stores.
These initiatives  included introduction of technology solutions catering  to jewellery retail, setting up of centralised distribution  centre for faster delivery of goods to stores, training  of store staff to improve better service to customers   and others.
There is also an added focus on building in-house designs  so that customers can get most exquisite designs, which  are uniquely available at Reliance Jewels store.
With the Government relaxing import restriction recently,  better availability of bullion and stabilising of gold prices,  the business growth should return in the sector in the  near future.

JIO INFOCOMM Market environment With more than 961 million mobile users as of February  2015 (Source: TRAI), India has achieved a tele-density  of more than 76%.
However, the growth in broadband  connections has not been commensurate with the  enormous growth of India’s telecommunication industry.
India has only around 18.7 million broadband connections  as of September, 2014 (Source: TRAI), excluding  internet access by wireless phone subscribers, which is  comparatively lower than other countries.
LTE, a fourth generation wireless technology that offers  higher speed, is likely to alter the contours of the Indian  wireless industry and drive the ‘Digital India’ movement.
LTE rollouts will not only accelerate data adoption (user  base and usage) in India, but will also cause a dramatic  shift for 4G services.
RIL ’s subsidiary RJIL has made significant progress in  building its LTE business, including physical network  infrastructure, systems and processes, sales and  distribution network, applications and services, content  and many others.
It is working with strategic partners  who have committed significant resources, know-how  and global talent to support the deployment and testing  activities currently underway.
Spectrum acquisition and infrastructure tie-ups RJIL is the only private player with Broadband Wireless  Access (BWA) spectrum in all the 22 telecom circles of  India.
It plans to provide reliable fast internet connectivity  through the 20 MHz, contiguous, pan-India BWA spectrum.
RJIL has also successfully acquired 1800 MHz spectrum  across 14 key circles in February, 2014.
In March 2015, RJIL successfully acquired the right to use  spectrum in 800 MHz band or 1800 MHz band or both  in 13 key circles across India in the spectrum auction  conducted by DoT, GoI.
With this acquisition, in addition  to the pan-India 2300 MHz spectrum, RJIL has spectrum  in either 800 MHz or 1800 MHz or both, in 20 out of the  total 22 circles in the country.
RJIL ’s total equivalent  spectrum footprint has increased from 597.6 MHz to 751.1  MHz (including uplink and downlink), strengthening its  position as the largest holder of liberalised spectrum.

4.
Profit   RIL consistently endeavour to enhance shareholder  value.
RIL ’s financial performance is explained in  section ‘Financial Performance and Review’ on page  49 of Management Discussion & Analysis report  followed by commentary on each of the major  business.
C)  RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL  CONTROL 1.
Introduction   Reliance actively stimulates entrepreneurship  throughout the organisation and encourages its  people to identify and seize opportunities.
The  current economic environment, in combination with  significant growth ambitions of Reliance, carries  with it an evolving set of risks.
Reliance recognises  that these risks need to be managed to protect  its customers, employees, shareholders and other  stakeholders, to achieve its business objectives and  enable sustainable growth.
Risk and opportunity  management is therefore a key element of the overall  Reliance strategy.
This section provides an overview  of the key strategic risks, Reliance’s risk and control  framework, and its approach to risk management.
2.
Creating Value through Risk Management   Reliance operates in diverse industries and global  markets, and therefore requires a balanced approach  to risk management.
An integrated system of  risk management and internal controls, which is  tailored to the specific segments of Reliance and its  businesses, is deployed, taking into account various  factors, such as the size and nature of the inherent  risks and the regulatory environment of the individual  business segment or operating company.
This  framework undergoes continuous improvements  to allow Reliance to optimise its management of  risk exposures, while taking advantage of business  opportunities.
3.
Reliance’s View on Risk 3.1 Risk Appetite   Reliance’s risk appetite is linked to its strategic  approach and is based on the stance it has taken  across four areas:   Strategic and commercial:  Reliance manages  strategic risk in the pursuit of profitable growth  in both mature and emerging markets.
Given the  volatile markets and economic climate in which it  operates, the adaptability of its people, its service  offering, and its infrastructure are key to manage its  risk.
Safety and operations:  Reliance is committed to  conduct all its activities in such a manner so as to avoid  harm to employees and the community.
It strives to  deliver safe, reliable and compliant operations.
02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 87   Compliance and control: Compliance with laws and  regulations is fundamental to maintain Reliance’s  license to operate in the various industries that it  operates in.
Reliance also believes that accurate  and reliable information provides a competitive  advantage and is key to effective management of its  business.
It therefore accepts minimal risk in relation  to reporting risks.
Financial: Reliance manages financial risk to maintain  a prudent financing strategy, even when undertaking  major investment, and therefore taking controlled  risks in this area.
3.2 Risk factors   Reliance emphasises on those risks that threaten the  achievement of business objectives of the Group over  the short to medium term.
An overview of these risks  is provided hereafter, including the actions taken to  mitigate these risks and any related opportunities: i) Strategic and Commercial risks a.
Prices and markets   Reliance’s financial performance is subject to the  fluctuating prices of crude oil & gas and downstream  petroleum products.
Prices of oil & gas products are  affected by supply and demand, both globally and  regionally.
Factors that influence the supply and  demand include operational issues, natural disasters,  political instability, economic conditions and many  others.
For example, lower prices will mean lower  revenues for Reliance’s upstream production and as a  result the long-term upstream projects may become  less profitable.
In addition, this may also have an  impact on booked reserves.
Prolonged unfavourable  conditions could also result in cancellation of projects  or impairment of assets.
Mitigation: Since Reliance operates an integrated  hydrocarbon business, some of these risks can  be offset by gains in other parts of the Reliance’s  business.
In addition, Reliance proactively hedge’s  these exposures.
b.
Competitive forces   While Reliance seeks to compete on the basis of  product differentiation, it operates in commodity- type markets.
It is therefore, important to manage  its costs, to ensure it has an edge in pricing over its  competitors.
Surplus refining capacity in India, augmentation  of refining capacities by PSUs (Public Sector  Undertaking) and the additions of new refining  capacity in Asia, notably in China and the Middle East,  will increase competition in the region, potentially  impacting GRM in its refining and marketing business.
Mitigation: As a risk-mitigating strategy, Reliance  continues to diversify its product portfolio and also  develop new export markets.
It is also investing in  projects to strengthen cost competitiveness.
c. Brand and reputational risks   As one of India’s leading brands, Reliance’s reputation  is an important asset.
Mitigation: The Group has defined a RMS and code of  conduct that govern how all employees in Reliance  operate.
Compliance with these organisational  policies, code of conduct, regulatory compliance  requirements and other governance requirements,  are key to protect Reliance’s reputation.
d.  Political instability, acts of terrorism, government  policies   Social or civil unrest, in geographical areas where  Reliance operates, can have an impact on its  operations.
Potential developments that may impact  its business operations include government pricing  policy of petroleum products, piracy on high seas,  any changes to Indo-US economic policy, acts of  terrorism or civil unrest that may have an impact on  safe operations of its facilities and transportation of  its products.
Political unrest and tensions in the Middle East, North  Africa can cause short-term fluctuations in crude  prices and crude availability.
Mitigation: To mitigate the risks resulting from non- availability of crude and feedstock, Reliance has a  diversified crude sourcing strategy from multiple  geographies (Asia, the Middle East, West Africa, Latin  / South America and North Africa) under both short- term and long-term arrangements.
ii) Safety and operational risks a.
Changing technology and obsolescence risk   The changing technologies and the natural ageing  of existing facilities pose the risk of production  plants becoming obsolete and uneconomic.
Aged  plants are prone to unplanned shutdowns, increased  maintenance and operating costs.
Deployment  of new technologies and ongoing maintenance  processes are key to enhancing the reliability of  operations and reduction in operating costs, while  improving the safety of operating conditions by  extending the useful life of assets.
Mitigation: Reliance utilises a dedicated Research &  Development function, which develops near term  and incremental improvements, as well as step  change improvements to existing products and  processes.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited b. Cybersecurity risk   At Reliance, the use of information and  telecommunication technologies is increasing,  resulting in greater security threats to its digital  infrastructure.
A breach of its digital security or  disruptions to its digital infrastructure, due to  intentional actions, such as cyber-attacks or human  error could lead to serious impacts to its businesses.
These impacts may include injury to staff, loss of  control, impact on continuity or damage to assets  and services, harm to the environment, the loss of  sensitive data or information, legal and regulatory  breaches and reputational damage.
Mitigation: Reliance continues to strengthen its  responses to cybersecurity threats through proactive  and reactive risk mitigations.
These include, proactive  activities to continuously improve its cybersecurity  policies, standards, technical safeguard, ongoing  monitoring of new and existing threats and IT  security awareness initiatives.
Its reactive responses  to cybersecurity threats, which include IT disaster  recovery, emergency response and business  continuity management capabilities to enable the  reduction of the impacts of a cybersecurity event.
c. Major project execution risk   Reliance’s future growth plans depend upon  successful delivery of major capital projects.
Major  capital projects include the Jamnagar project (cracker,  gasification etc.
), which is designed to deliver a step  change in energy costs and increase the production  capacity of ethylene and other downstream products  at the complex, as well as the launch of a pan-India  telecom infrastructure to provide 4G LTE TDD high  speed wireless internet and mobile communication  services.
Delivery of these major projects is key to  Reliance’s future financial performance.
Managing  the risks related to the delivery of these and other  major capital projects is key to enhancing Reliance’s  long-term shareholder value.
Mitigation: Project risk management is embedded in  the way Reliance delivers projects.
These includes a  specialised project delivery function with experience  project management professionals, project risk  modelling on a project-by-project basis, partnering  with experienced vendors to execute complex  projects and ongoing review and escalation of issues  that undermine project success.
d.  Evolving Health, Safety, Security and Environmental  (HSSE) risks   Reliance is exposed to a wide spectrum of HSSE risks,  given the diversity and complexity of the industries,  it operates in.
The exploration and production of oil  and gas, transportation of the hydrocarbons and their  further refining and processing is regulated by various  HSSE related regulations across the geographies  where Reliance operates.
A major HSSE incident, such  as fire, oil spill, security breach can result in loss of life,  environmental degradation and overall disruption in  business activities.
Mitigation: Reliance follows an HSE policy that ‘Safety  of persons overrides all production targets’ , which  incentivises all employees to strive for excellence in  safety management for the benefit of its employees,  customers and the communities.
Reliance has set  it self the goal of ‘zero injuries and incidents‘ .
The   Group conducts HSSE audits to get assurance on   HSSE management framework protocols and  regulatory compliances.
iii) Compliance and control risks a.
Reporting and estimation of provisions and reserves   The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves  subjective judgements and determinations based  on available geological, technical, contractual and  economic information.
These estimates may change  depending on the availability of new information  from production and drilling activities, or changes  in economic factors like change in pricing of crude,  projection of foreign exchange rates and natural  decline in the field and unexpected geological  complexity, among others.
The published provisions  and reserves may also be subject to correction due to  errors in application of published rules and change in  guidance.
Any downward adjustment would indicate  lower production volumes in the upstream business.
Mitigation: Reliance has a reserves assurance  framework and process in place to ensure accuracy in  reporting of reserves volumes.
b.
Regulatory compliance risks   The evolution of the global regulatory environment  has resulted into increased regulatory scrutiny that  has raised the minimum standards to be maintained  by Reliance.
This signifies the alignment of corporate  performance objectives, while ensuring compliance  with regulatory requirements.
Mitigation: Reliance recognises that regulatory  requirements can at times be challenging, and  therefore will:    Strive to understand the changing regulatory  standards, so as to strengthen its decision  making processes and integrate these in the  business strategy of each of the industries in  which it operates     Drive business performance through the  convergence of risk, compliance processes  and controls mechanisms to ensure continued  operational efficiency and effectiveness 02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 89 of conduct and behaviours together form the RMS  that governs how Reliance conducts its business and  manage associated risks.
Reliance has introduced several improvements to  Integrated Enterprise Risk Management, Internal  Controls Management and Assurance Frameworks  and processes to drive a common integrated view of  risks, optimal risk mitigation responses and efficient  management of internal control and assurance  activities.
This integration is enabled by all three being  fully aligned across Group wide Risk Management,  Internal Control and Internal Audit methodologies  and processes.
Reliance’s risk management framework is designed  to be a simple, consistent and clear framework for  managing and reporting risks from the Reliance’s  operations to the Board.
The framework and related  processes seek to avoid incidents and maximise  business outcomes by allowing management to:    Understand the risk environment, and assess the  specific risks and potential exposure for Reliance.
Determine how to deal best with these risks to  manage overall potential exposure.
Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways.
Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness  of the management of these risks and intervene  for improvement wherever necessary.
Report up the management chain to the  board on a periodic basis about how risks are  being managed, monitored, assured and the  improvements that are being made.
Group Risk Management Framework   The Group Risk Management Framework, is designed  to help ensure risk management is an integral  part of the way that Reliance works everywhere to  enable risks to be identified, assessed and managed  appropriately.
The Group Risk Management  Framework comprises three levels:  Day-to-day Risk Management    Management and staff at Reliance’s facilities, assets  and functions identify and manage risk, promoting  safe, compliant and reliable operations.
For example,  Reliance’s group-wide Operating Management  System (OMS) integrates Reliance requirements  on health, safety, security, environment, social  responsibility, operational reliability and related  issues.
These Reliance requirements, along with  business needs and the applicable legal and  regulatory requirements, underpin the practical plans  developed to help reduce risk and deliver strong,  sustainable performance.
iv) Financial risks  Treasury risks   Treasury risks include, among others, exposure to  movements in interest rates and foreign exchange  rates.
Reliance also maintains sufficient liquidity, so  that it is able to meet its financial commitments on  due dates and is not forced to obtain funds at higher  interest rates.
It has access to markets worldwide and  it uses a range of products and currencies to ensure  that its funding is efficient and well diversified across  markets and investor types.
Foreign Exchange risk    Reliance prepares its financial statements in  Indian Rupee (INR), but most of the payables  and receivables of hydrocarbon business are  in US Dollars, minimising the cash flow risk on  account of fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates.
Reliance avails long-term foreign currency  liabilities (primarily in USD, EURO and JPY) to  fund its capital investments.
Reliance also avails short-term foreign currency  liabilities to fund its working capital.
Mitigation: Foreign exchange risk is tracked  and managed within the risk management  framework.
Short-term foreign currency asset –  liability mismatch is continuously monitored and  hedged.
The foreign exchange market is highly regulated  and Reliance ensures compliance with all the  regulations.
Interest rate risk    Reliance borrows funds from domestic and  international markets to meet its long-term and  short-term funding requirements.
It is subject to  risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates.
Mitigation: The interest rate risk is managed  through financial instruments available to  convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate  liabilities or vice-versa, and is aimed at reducing  the cost of borrowings.
4.
How Reliance manages risk   Reliance manages, monitors and reports on the  principal risks and uncertainties that can impact  its ability to achieve its strategic objectives.
The  Company has established the Reliance Management  System (RMS) as part of its transformation agenda.
RMS incorporates an integrated framework for  managing risks and internal controls.
The internal  financial controls have been documented, embedded  and digitised in the business processes.
Internal  controls are regularly tested for design and operating  effectiveness.

Reliance does this  by collating risk data, assessing risk management  activities, making further improvements and planning  new activities.
Oversight and Governance    Reliance’s Board, along with executive and functional  leadership provides oversight to identify and  understand significant risks.
They also put in place  systems of risk management, compliance and control  to mitigate these risks.
Executive committees set  policy and oversee the management of group risks,  and dedicated Board Committees review and monitor  certain risks throughout the year.
Reliance’s Group Risk team analyses the Group’s risk  profile and maintains the Group Risk Management  Framework.
Its Group Audit team provides  independent assurance to the Board, through its  Committees, over whether the Group’s system of  risk management and internal control is adequately  designed and operating effectively to respond  appropriately to the risks that are significant to  Reliance.
D)  SMART TRANSFORMATION AT RELIANCE  (STAR)   Reliance has been working to deliver a large scale,  multi-year business transformation programme  called STAR.
The STAR programme is an integral part of Reliance’s  strategy to build competitive advantage and use  technology for its advantage.
This programme has  seen concentrated efforts on three pillars - a)  People – to build and sustain a human capital  advantage b)  Processes Systems & Data – to develop an integrated,  end-to-end digital chain providing real time  information c)  Governance – to provide continuous assurance to all  stakeholders   The successful implementation of STAR will enable  the institutionalisation of Reliance’s DNA to:     Create a new set of leaders who retain the best  elements of what makes Reliance distinctive and  take its business forward with new energy and  entrepreneurship    Create scalable frameworks and methodologies  to extract full value from existing assets and  quickly integrate and monetise new lines of  business and acquisitions    Implement world class integrated processes  and systems solutions to fully leverage existing  and emerging technologies to allow Reliance to  become more informed, effective and efficient Strategy People Processes, Systems & Data Governance Goals &  Outcomes STAR Programme 02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Management’s Discussion and Analysis 91 Coverage of STAR STAR covers three businesses, Refining & Marketing,  Petrochemicals and Oil & Gas Exploration & Production,  and support functions such as Manufacturing, Projects,  Procurement & Contracting, Logistics, Human Resources  (HR), Finance, Information Technology (IT), Research  and Development, Corporate Security, Governance &  Integration (G&I), Risk and Audit.
Progress during the year Successful transformation requires vision, leadership,  dedication, discipline and teamwork sustained over  a multi-year timeframe.
Reliance continues to meet  this criteria for the STAR project which is unique and  unparalleled in both scope and outcome.
Significant  progress being made across the entire agenda during   FY 2014-15 with the following highlights.
1.
People   Reliance has taken strong steps forward in its HR  Transformation, a key part of its STAR Business  Transformation programme.
Under the banner of  ‘R-HR Transformation’ , the programme is steeped in  a desire to drive both a culture change in Reliance  and to embrace new business processes used by  the world’s leading companies.
The objective of this  transformation is to achieve Reliance’s vision of being:   “A modern, progressive people environment, where  purpose-driven talent are attracted and motivated by  a consistent meritocratic HR framework and where  high quality leaders capable of realising RIL business  goals are identified, encouraged, and rewarded.
”   Significant progress has been made during   FY 2014-15.
Reliance launched new ‘Values & Behaviours’    Implemented new processes for employee  objective setting and performance management  This better aligns corporate and individual  performance and rewards    Implemented improved Talent Management  processes    Started to develop new Leadership Development  and Learning programs 2.
Processes, Systems and Data   Reliance started with the aim of seamlessly integrating  and systems enabling all of its processes.
To achieve  this Reliance mapped all of the key processes in detail.
These processes were then integrated and optimised  with the aim to technology enable them through a  series of system go-lives.
Till date Reliance successfully delivered integrated  systems go-lives for the E&P business in April 2014  and for the R&M business in January 2015.
The R&M  go live was very large and complex and was delivered  successfully without impacting business operations.
The scope included Jamnagar refinery and included  Petrochemicals activities at the site.
With these   go-lives Reliance has made substantial progress to  automated processes, reducing manual effort and  improving controls and transparency through an  end-to-end digital chain.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited REPORT ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AT RIL At RIL, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is embedded  in the long term business strategy of the Company.
For  RIL, business priorities co-exist with social commitments  to drive holistic development of people and communities.
The Company’s CSR initiatives help elevate the quality of  life of millions, especially the disadvantaged sections of   the society.
It seeks to touch and transform people’s lives by promoting  healthcare, education and employment opportunities.
RIL aims to continue its efforts to build on its tradition of  social responsibility to empower people and deepen its  social engagements.
Corporate Social Responsibility Philosophy:  The  Company’s initiatives support inclusive growth.
Focus Areas of Engagement For a company with diversified businesses like RIL, there  are several opportunities to increase and deepen social  impact significantly and generate value for all.
RIL seeks  to strategically consolidate the Company’s CSR initiatives  to focus on discrete social problems and enable people to  earn their livelihoods.
To streamline its social initiatives,  the Company, in its CSR policy, has identified six focus  areas that aim to positively and holistically impact society.
RIL ’s six focus areas comprise:  Rural Transformation  Healthcare  Education  Environment  Protection of National Heritage, Art and Culture  Disaster Response For more information please refer CSR policy   http://www.ril.com/getattachment/d5fd70ef-e019-47e5- bb83-de2077874505/Corporate-Social-Responsibility- Policy.aspx RIL has undertaken numerous initiatives aimed at  developing the communities around which the Company  conducts its operations.
The overriding objective is to  create value and ensure all inclusive growth.
RIL is working assiduously to ensure that economic wealth  is not just limited to the privileged, but distributed in a  manner that benefits the marginalised sections of society.
The Company has made significant contributions to  help shape India’s vision of inclusive growth.
Sustainable  development strategies have helped RIL to create thriving  eco-systems towards profitable growth and creation of  societal value for multiple stakeholders.
RIL goes beyond  its business activities to create societal impact through its  diverse initiatives.
The Company has been involved in various social  responsibility initiatives over the decades.
In 2010, these  activities were brought under the Reliance Foundation (The  Foundation), the umbrella organisation for the Company’s  social sector initiatives.
Through these initiatives, the  Company engages with communities to ensure their  well-being by enhancing access to quality education and  healthcare, capacity building for employment generation,  access to good infrastructure and ecological conservation.

The Foundation’s strategy combines a judicious mix of  technology, material and information with specific focus  on agriculture and marine fisheries.
It is currently working  with over 94,000 rural households.
Livelihoods The Foundation works on enhancing opportunities  and disseminating information relevant to improving  livelihood options among rural communities.
It deploys  locally-relevant solutions to promote agriculture, marine  fisheries and other farm and non-farm based activities.
Systematic efforts are taken to improve the quality and  productivity of assets leading to increased and more  reliable yields.
17,902 hectares of land has been enriched  in FY 2014-15 (48,913 hectares since inception).
Location  specific information is provided to fisher folk to help them  effectively plan their sea routes, navigate directly to fish  aggregation zones and return with heavier hauls in lesser  time.
10,489 advisories (14,274 since inception) were  disseminated to farmers and fisher folk through 54, 59,347  calls .
The Foundation focuses on building the capacity of  communities that it works with.
This initiative starts from the  time that the Foundation engages with them by ensuring  their participation in the resource mapping and planning  exercise.
More than need-based training, programmes  have been conducted to further enhance the skills and  knowledge of 1,87,415 small and marginal farmers, women  and fisher folk.
Trainings on sustainable agricultural  practices, soil and water conservation, pest management,  feeding and fodder management for livestock, use of  organic fertilisers, GPS handling, hygienic handling of fish,  sea safety etc.
have been imparted.
Silaging with Polypropylene Flexible  Intermediate Bulk Containers (PP FIBCs) RIL has assisted dairy farmers in Punjab and Haryana  by implementing education programmes on silage  production/preparation and how to bag the silage using  polypropylene flexible intermediate bulk containers  known as PP FIBCs.
The training produced solutions to  problems faced by farmers, such as low milk yield, acute  scarcity of fodder and a lack of knowledge among farmers  on how to make silage.
The programme redesigned bag sizes found in the supply  chain, thereby increasing delivery speed and promptness.
RIL also supplied the farmers with free sample bags  and cattle feed for the programme’s first 40 days.
The  programme also brought in world-class fodder seed  supplies to the farmers.
There were a number of key innovations that this  programme brought about, namely the use of anti- rodent bags, applying a redesign of the FIBC so that the  inner lining was laminated, eliminating the use of liners  – leading to operational convenience.
The benefits of the  programme were substantial.
Surplus fodder that would  have otherwise gone to waste was made into silage, and a  silage bank was set up for times of need.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited In a cost/benefit analysis, it was seen that the initial  investment was very low compared to conventional silage  pits.
Silage bags ensure zero maintenance cost, which can  be transported from fodder surplus to nil fodder districts.
The programme also received a number of awards for  its work, including letters of product acceptance and  certifications received from government departments,  such as the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) in  Punjab and Haryana.
Similar programmes have been implemented in Rajasthan  by Rajasthan University of Veterinary and Animal Science  (RJUVAS) and 17 other states.
Polypropylene Nonwoven Fruit Cover for  Pomegranates  RIL has assisted various pomegranate farms in Karnataka  and Maharashtra in dealing with problems of low fruit  yield and low productivity, insects and pests, poor quality  fruit, and wastage.
Through the programme, farmers were educated on  fruit bagging through various media such as case  study presentations, and practical demonstrations.
The  programme redesigned the bag size used to hold the  produce in order to fit with the quality and size of said  produce.
RIL also created a supply chain for quicker  delivery of the bags.
There were challenges faced during the implementation  of the programme, such as tying the cover over individual  fruit which was a major issue, fruit ripening, and the  availability of readymade fruit covers with the right kind  of materials for easy retrieval.
However, despite these challenges, the programme was  successful in significantly increasing productivity and  yield, going up 10 MT per hectare.
Fruits produced were  of a more uniform size and deeper red colour, and the  general quality also increased such that the fruit was fit  for export.
As a result, the average price fetched by the  pomegranate also increased by 20%.
Social Security for Villagers of Balangir District The Foundation has initiated a life insurance programme  for villagers of the Balangir district of Odisha.
It is an  attempt to provide a social security net to the villagers of  the district against accidents and threats, such as falling  from tree and snake bites.
The medical camps have been  organised and the villagers have been educated on social  security tools including insurance.
Balangir District is one of the poorest districts of India and  is globally known for its poverty, drought and migration.
Predominantly an agrarian district, with more than 70%  of the population dependent on agriculture for their  livelihood.
The villagers face various threats while collecting  Non Woods Forest Products (NWFP) such as Kendu leaf,  Mahula and Broom, for their survival.
The Foundation, with  the support of Village Farmers Association (VFA) leaders,  has opted for the Janata Accidental Insurance Policy of  the National Insurance Company for hapless villagers.
The  policy insures individual villagers for an amount of ` 1 lakh  against a premium of ` 60.
The Foundation also organised  a policy related discussion in one of the district’s villages  where farmers from nearby seven villages participated.
Through this initiative, the Foundation has already helped  613 insured farmers.
Another 836 farmers are in the  process of getting insured.
Beneficiary of the Foundation’s Initiative Food and Nutrition Security The Foundation directly engages with small and marginal  farmers and promotes sustainable agricultural practices  to transform their lives.
Large patches of fallow land  is being transformed, enriched and brought under  cultivation with an increase in the crop yield through the  adoption of practices, such as mixed cropping, integrated  pest management and the use of farmyard manure and  rainwater conservation efforts.
10,379 kitchen gardens  (26,671 since inception) called Reliance Nutrition Gardens  have been constructed this year among rural households  to supplement their nutritional intake.
All these initiatives have helped improve productivity, food  and nutrition and self-sufficiency among the marginalised  communities.
Water Security The Foundation’s engagement with farmers is spread  across multiple agro-ecological sub regions with issues  REPORT ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CONTINUED) Rain water harvesting 447 lakh cubic meter of rain water has been stored for  irrigation for communities 02-45 46-103 104-201 202-315 316-348 Corporate Overview Management Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Report on Corporate Social Responsibility 97 of poor soil quality, dependence on rain, low productivity  and poor accessibility to services.
Together with farmers,  the Foundation has developed water harvesting structures  that are critical sources of irrigation for these communities  living in dry and rain-fed areas, and created capacities to  harvest and store 203 lakh cubic metres of rain water in  the last one year (447 lakh cubic metres since inception).
Leveraging Knowledge and Institution Building RIL partners with knowledge providers, research  institutions, line departments, NGOs and others for  relevant information and disseminates it to those who  need it.
The Foundation currently has 456 knowledge  partners across different states.
A knowledge base is created by collating queries asked  and solutions provided, thereby creating a repository  of local knowledge that can be used going forward.
Collecting, processing, packaging and disseminating  demand-driven multilingual information, aligned with  local context and culture in multimedia formats, helps  to overcome language and literacy barriers.
Rural  communities are involved through multiple interactive  information dissemination programmes, including a  helpline on which they can call.
Feedback is also obtained  from fishermen and farmers who benefit from the various  information dissemination programmes.
The Foundation encourages participation from  communities for planning and decision-making, where it  is intervening through the formation of Village Farmers’  Association (VFAs).
504 such VFAs have been formed where  farmers participate in decision-making processes and  develop individual as well as community development  plans.
There is a lot of emphasis on building capacities of  communities.
Farmers are trained in best practices and  are encouraged to adopt them.
Institution-building  efforts and promotion of self-governance through VFAs  encourage farmers to come together and engage in  collective decision making.
The programme also promotes  the involvement of women and the most marginal farmers  in a village, for whom VFAs have become a platform where  their voices are heard.
HEAL THCARE Over the years, the Foundation has been working towards  enhancing India’s access to quality and affordable  healthcare.
The Foundation’s integrated healthcare model  aims to reach out to the most vulnerable sections of society,  through a network of healthcare delivery mechanisms and  awareness and diagnostic specialty camps.
It is committed  to contributing towards the nation’s efforts in achieving  the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations  and aims to support the efforts, especially in the field of  maternal and child health care.

RIL aims to make its products safer and more  environment friendly.
1.
List three products or services whose design has  incorporated social or environmental concerns,  risks and/or opportunities.
It is RIL ’s constant endeavour to make products that  not only have a positive impact on the environment,  but also cater to consumer needs.
Some of the  products created during FY 2014-15 are listed below:   a)  Rice Husk Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Composite  boards for construction and furniture  applications    Rice Husk PVC Composites are manufactured  using PVC resin, additives and Rice Husk (Husk  generated during milling).
As these products  perform equally well compared to wood, they  have potential to save forest coverage of the  country by reducing the demand of wood.
The husk generated during milling of rice is  mostly used in the boilers for processing paddy,  producing energy through direct combustion  and/or by gasification.
The ash generated as  a result is a great environment threat causing  damage to the land and the surrounding area in  which it is dumped.
Rice Husk PVC composite    Rice Husk PVC Composites can be cut, nailed,  screwed, glued and routed like wood.
These  properties make it useful for various products  including furniture, siding, shuttering, flooring,  railing, partitions and doors.
Rice Husk PVC  composites also have potential in industrial  applications like industrial lumbers, pallets etc.
Rice Husk PVC products are used in Green  Buildings across the world due to their potential  to meet the necessary requirements.
RIL organised meeting with many processors  to manufacture Rice Husk PVC products.
To  start with, two processors have ventured into  manufacturing of Rice Husk PVC Composite  construction boards.
b)  PE Flexible Silo Bags for food grain storage to  reduce the wastage of food grain    Hermetic Storage (HS) technology has emerged  as a significant alternative to other methods  of storage that protect commodities from  insects and molds.
HS is based on the principle  of generation of an oxygen-depleted, carbon  dioxide-enriched interstitial atmosphere caused  by the respiration of the living organisms in the  ecological system of a sealed storage.
Silo Recron Green Products is a Bulk Grain Storage  system which is a low cost alternative to fixed  structure storage.
A Silo Bag is simply a long PE  (polyethylene) bag that comes in different sizes.
A Silo Bag is a laminated mix of three layers of PE.
The first two layers act as a UV filter.
The third layer is  black and is designed to keep out the sunlight.
Workers using Silo Bags for Grain Storage    The basic principle is to keep the grain in a modified  atmosphere, low in oxygen and with a high  concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Once filled,  the bag is sealed.
The conditions within the bag  thereafter control the breading of vermin, insects  and fungi, eliminating the need for fumigation .

RIL prefers vendors  who undertake green initiatives and reduce, reuse,  recycle as a continuous exercise.
The Company takes  highest care in safe handling of its materials and also  does reconnaissance of entire logistics handling/ storage from supplier factory to its gate.
Through  it’s large scale new capacity addition projects, it has  enabled the creation of a large engineering base in  India.
3.
Steps taken to procure goods and services from  local and small producers, including communities  and capability building activities undertaken for  local and small vendors   RIL has invested in mega projects and operations  in India.
These investments have developed India’s  chemicals and engineering supplier base.
Today  leading Indian engineering companies, raw materials  companies and industrial goods companies are RIL ’s  long-term vendor partners.
Through its sustained  efforts, the Company has helped local industry develop  new products to serve its needs and enabled them to  grow their businesses globally.
While RIL always believes  in working with highest capability vendors, majority of  its suppliers and contractors are India based.
RIL ’s manufacturing sites act as economic nerve  centres for local communities.
The Company ensures  that it engages local villagers and small businesses  around its plants in variety of productive employment  especially through vehicle hiring, material handling,  housekeeping, waste-handling and horticulture  contracts.
Some of these vendors have been  serving the Company’s manufacturing sites for  the past two generations.
These contracts have  led to entrepreneurship development around the  manufacturing sites and have created employment  for the populace.
CASE STUDY- JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF APE  FREE SPIN FINISH FOR PSF   RIL has been working hand-in-hand with one of its  long time suppliers of speciality chemicals, Croda,  for adopting sustainable products/ technologies.
Spin finishes are speciality chemicals (surfactants)  used during manufacture of polyester fibres.
Depending on the application, the spin finish may  be washed off during production or remain on the  fibre to deliver some processing characteristics  to the fibre.
Alkyl Phenol Ethokylate (APE) based  surfactants are used in the industry due to their very  high performance.
However studies have indicated  that APEs are slow to degrade, bio-accumulate,  toxic to aquatic organisms and endocrine disruptor  in higher animals.
In an endeavour to create spin  finishes that are sustainable and environment  friendly, RIL, along with Croda, worked to develop  spin finishes that are APE free and also compliant  with Öko-Tex Standard (independent testing and  certification system for textile products).

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited    CASE STUDY- VENDOR AND SUPPLIER  ORIENTATION ON ENVIRONMENT AND  SAFETY ISSUES   Regulatory and legal compliance are of top  priority for the Company and violation of any sorts  is unacceptable.
RIL has conducted awareness  programmes for vendors, suppliers, contractors  about its philosophy towards health, safety and  environment.
4.
Mechanism to recycle products and waste and the  percentage of recycling of products and waste  (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%)   RIL considers waste minimisation as the first  step towards responsible management of waste.
Through process technology and operational  control measures, it intends to minimise the  generation of product or process waste.
However,  considering the nature of its operations, there  is a certain amount of waste generation which  is inevitable.
Recycling and reusing of waste  helps the Company in reducing its environmental  impact while at the same time improving the  material efficiency of the operations.
In this  direction, RIL has taken various measures such  as converting waste to organic manure and bio- gas generation, recycling of used oil, slop oil and  oily sludge at Jamnagar plant, recycling of waste  PET bottles at Hazira, Nagothane, Hoshiarpur  and Barabanki plants and recycling of used/ waste oil, spent catalysts through authorised  re-processors.
RIL ensures responsible disposal of waste generated  by partnering with various agencies to encourage  end-of-life recycling and reuse.
The industrial waste  generated at the Naroda plant is converted into useful  ‘bio-manure’ by the vermi-composting method,  thereby reducing the load of waste disposal on the  environment.
Jamnagar Refinery   The Jamnagar refinery has reduced its load on  the environment by tapping and desalinating  sea water instead of using fresh water resources.
The waste water generated is treated and used for  green belt development thereby ensuring zero  effluent discharge.
Continuous focus on waste minimisation, reuse and  recycle help the Company in reducing consumption  of virgin material.
RIL has recycled treated waste water across its  manufacturing divisions.
RIL is recycling about 60000 tons/year of polyester  both industrial and consumer waste, and has plans to  expand further in recycling capacity.
Polyester fabric waste recycling: Work is underway  to develop a process to recover polyester component  of fabrics and enzymatically hydrolyse the products  of non- polyester components like cotton and viscose  to glucose.
As a value addition, this glucose can be  consumed for production of various biochemicals  while the polyester recovered can be recycled.
CASE STUDY- OPTIMISATION OF EFFLUENT  TREATMENT OPERATIONS AT HAZIRA  MANUFACTURING DIVISION   Primary treatment is done for individual effluent  streams at the plant level as per the requirement.
These streams are then segregated into Low Total  Dissolved Solids (LTDS) streams and High Total  Dissolved Solids (HTDS) streams and led to separate  LTDS Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and HTDS ETP  respectively.
The effluent at both the LTDS and HTDS  ETPs are sequentially treated in primary, secondary  and tertiary treatment facilities.
Treated effluents  from HTDS ETP are discharged outside after ensuring  that quality of the effluent meets or is better than  the prescribed discharge standards.
The treated  effluent from LTDS ETP are further processed through  reverse osmosis plant and recycled as make-up water  to cooling towers.
About 8000 m3/day of treated  effluent (25% of total volume) is thus reused as make- up water to cooling tower, reducing requirement of  freshwater for the complex.
Principle 3 Businesses should promote the well-being of all  employees RIL believes in its people power propelling its  progressive growth.

For a new India.Reliance Industries Limited CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT “Between my past, the present and the future,  there is one common factor: Relationship and  Trust.
This is the foundation of our growth.

We consider stakeholders  as partners in our success, and we remain committed  to maximising stakeholders’ value, be it shareholders,  employees, suppliers, customers, investors, communities  or policy makers.
This approach to value creation  emanates from our belief that sound governance system,  based on relationship and trust, is integral to creating  enduring value for all.
We have a defined policy framework  for ethical conduct of businesses.
We believe that any  business conduct can be ethical only when it rests on the  six core values of Customer Value, Ownership Mindset,  Respect, Integrity, One Team and Excellence.
STATEMENT ON COMPANY’S PHILOSOPHY ON  CODE OF GOVERNANCE Corporate Governance encompasses a set of systems and  practices to ensure that the Company’s affairs are being  managed in a manner which ensures accountability,  transparency and fairness in all transactions in the widest  sense.
The objective is to meet stakeholders’ aspirations  and societal expectations.
Good governance practices  stem from the dynamic culture and positive mindset of the  organisation.
We are committed to meet the aspirations of  all our stakeholders.
This is demonstrated in shareholder  returns, high credit ratings, governance processes and an  entrepreneurial performance focused work environment.
Additionally, our customers have benefited from high  quality products delivered at extremely competitive  prices.
The essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting  and maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability  in the management’s higher echelons.
The demands of  Corporate Governance require professionals to raise their  competence and capability levels to meet the expectations  in managing the enterprise and its resources effectively  with the highest standards of ethics.
It has thus become  crucial to foster and sustain a culture that integrates all  components of good governance by carefully balancing  the complex inter-relationship among the Board of  Directors, Audit Committee, Finance, Compliance and  Assurance teams, Auditors and the senior management.
Our employee satisfaction is reflected in the stability of  our senior management, low attrition across various levels  and substantially higher productivity.
Above all, we feel  honoured to be integral to India’s social development.
Details of several such initiatives are available in the  Report on Corporate Social Responsibility.
At RIL, we believe that as we move closer towards our  aspirations of being a global cor poration, our Corporate  Governance standards must be globally benchmarked.

It constantly  strives to adopt emerging best practices being followed  worldwide.
It is our endeavour to achieve higher standards  and provide oversight and guidance to the management  in strategy implementation, risk management and  fulfilment of stated goals and objectives.
Over the years, we have strengthened governance  practices.

Stakeholders’ interests  are taken into account, before making any business  decision.

The result of our initiative is our ever widening reach  and recall.
Our shareholder base has grown from 52,000  after the IPO to a consolidated present base of around 2.8  million.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION   The consolidated financial statements relate to Reliance Industries Limited (‘the Company’) and its subsidiary  companies, associates and joint ventures.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following  basis:  a)  The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line  basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after fully  eliminating intra-group balances and intra-group transactions in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS)  21 - “Consolidated Financial Statements”  b)  Interest in Joint Ventures have been accounted by using the proportionate consolidation method as per  Accounting Standard (AS) 27 - “Financial Reporting of Interest in Joint Ventures” .
c)  In case of foreign subsidiaries, being non-integral foreign operations, revenue items are consolidated at the  average rate prevailing during the year.
All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end  of the year.
Any exchange difference arising on consolidation is recognised in the Exchange Fluctuation  Reserve.
d)  The difference between the cost of investment in the subsidiaries, over the net assets at the time of acquisition  of shares in the subsidiaries is recognised in the financial statements as Goodwill or Capital Reserve, as the  case may be.
e)  The difference between the proceeds from disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying amount of  its assets less liabilities as of the date of disposal is recognised in the consolidated Profit and Loss Statement  being the profit or loss on disposal of investment in subsidiary.
f )  Minority Interest’s share of net profit of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted  against the income of the group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to shareholders of the  Company.
g)  Minority Interest’s share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the  consolidated balance sheet separate from liabilities and the equity of the Company’s shareholders.
h)  Investment in Associate Companies has been accounted under the equity method as per Accounting  Standard (AS) 23 - “Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements” .
i)  The Company accounts for its share of post acquisition changes in net assets of associates, after eliminating  unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and its associates to  the extent of its share, through its Consolidated Profit and Loss Statement, to the extent such change is  attributable to the associates’ Profit and Loss Statement and through its reserves for the balance based on  available information.
j)  The difference between the cost of investment in the associates and the share of net assets at the time of  acquisition of shares in the associates is identified in the financial statements as Goodwill or Capital Reserve  as the case may be.
k)  As far as possible, the consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for  like transactions and other events in similar circumstances and are presented in the same manner as the  Company’s separate financial statements.
C.  Investments other than in subsidiaries and associates have been accounted as per Accounting Standard (AS) 13 on  “Accounting for Investments” .

Dividend payment through NEFT denotes  payment of dividend electronically through RBI  clearing to selected bank branches which have  implemented Core Banking Solutions (CBS).
This  extends to all over the country, and is not necessarily  restricted to the 91 designated centres where  payment can be handled through ECS.
To facilitate  payment through NEFT, the shareholder is required  to ensure that the bank branch where his/her  account is operated, is under CBS and also records  the particulars of the new bank account with the DP  with whom the demat account is maintained.
2.7  What is payment of dividend through  direct credit and how does it operate?
The Company will be appointing a bank as its  Dividend banker for distribution of dividend.
The  said banker will carry out direct credit to those  investors who are maintaining accounts with the  said bank, provided the bank account details are  registered with the DP for dematerialised shares  and / or registered with the Company’s R&TA prior to  the payment of dividend for shares held in physical  form.
2.8  What should a shareholder do in case of  non-receipt of dividend?
Shareholders may write to the Company’s R&TA,  furnishing the particulars of the dividend not  received and quoting the folio number /DPID and  Client ID particulars (in case of dematerialised  shares).
On expiry of the validity period, if the  dividend warrant is still shown as unpaid in the  records of the Company, duplicate warrant will be  issued.
The R&TA would request the concerned  shareholder to execute an indemnity before issuing  the duplicate warrant.
No duplicate warrants will be issued against those  shares wherein a ‘stop transfer indicator’ has been  instituted either by virtue of a complaint or by law,  unless the procedure for releasing the same has  been completed.
2.9   Why do the shareholders have to wait till  the expiry of the validity period of the  original warrant for issue of duplicate  warrant?
Since the dividend warrants are payable at par  at several centres across the country, banks do  not accept ‘stop payment’ instructions.
Hence,  shareholders have to wait till the expiry of the  validity of the original warrant for issue of duplicate  warrant.
Validity of dividend warrant is three months  from the date of issue of the warrant.
