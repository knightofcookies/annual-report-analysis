UNILEVER SUSTAINABLE LIVING PLAN (USLP) The USLP is our key differentiator.
It is our blueprint  to drive sustainable growth and has three big goals,  i.e.
improving the health and well-being of more than  a billion people, reducing the environmental  footprint of the making and use of our products, and  enhancing the livelihoods of millions of people  across our value chain.
Our purpose Our clear Purpose helps us to remain  distinct in the eyes of consumers, retailers  and suppliers.
It also means we can set an ambitious  Vision – to double the size of the business  whilst reducing our environmental  footprint and increasing our positive   social impact.
To meet our growth ambition we invest in  people whose talent will help us win  through our brands and innovation,  unrivalled execution in the market place  and a relentless focus on continuous  improvement for greater efficiency.
Our environmental and social ambitions  are driven through the Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), which has  economic benefits and operates across all  our brands, markets and our entire   value chain.
Even when markets are tough we cannot  ignore sustainability.
If we did, this would  diminish the future resilience of Hindustan  Unilever Limited (HUL) for its long-term  shareholders.
We would miss out on the  growing consumer preference for goods  that do not damage the environment or  exploit people.
Our entire business would rely on  increasingly rare and expensive raw  materials, pushing up our costs.
Without  more efficient use of energy our  production costs would increase while we  would miss considerable savings from  more sustainable packaging and   less waste.
We would also risk the disapproval of  governments, regulators and NGOs, and  our brands could suffer reputational  damage, representing serious economic  loss to the business.
That’s why sustainability is at the heart of  everything we do to ensure we have a  viable long-term business that is attractive  to investors.

The business  continued to focus on the delivery of  consistent, competitive, profitable and  responsible growth.
This was another year  of exciting innovations, further  improvement in execution and sustained  focus on operational efficiencies.
Our  performance was anchored in the Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and we  made considerable progress on our  sustainability agenda.
We delivered broad-based growth along  with significant margin improvement.
Our  Domestic Consumer business grew by  10% with 5% underlying volume growth,  both ahead of market.
Profit before  interest and tax (PBIT) grew by 17% with  PBIT margin improving +90 bps.
Profit  after tax but before exceptional items, PAT  (bei), grew by 8% to Rs.
3,843 crores,  impacted by the higher tax rate.
Net Profit  at Rs.
4,315 crores was up 12%, aided by  the exceptional income arising from  property related sales.
The strong track  record of cash generation was sustained  as cash from operations exceeded   resulted in significant savings across the  board.
These savings helped to sustain  competitive investments behind our  brands and at the same time contributed  to the steady improvement in our  operating margins.
We continued to drive our USLP agenda  and made significant progress in the areas  of improving health and well-being,  reducing environmental impact and  enhancing livelihoods.
Since 2010, Lifebuoy has helped 63 million  people through its handwashing  programme and Pureit has partnered with  Micro Finance Institutions to provide safe  drinking water cumulatively to over three  lakh low income families in urban slums  and remote rural areas.
On the environmental front, we made  substantial progress on waste  management in our factories and water  conservation through the Hindustan  Unilever Foundation (HUF).
All our  factories became zero non-hazardous  waste to landfill sites and nearly 100% of  our manufacturing waste in factories was  recycled.
HUF has so far initiated 18  projects across India in partnership with  NGOs, government agencies and local  communities to address the issue of  depleting water resources.
These projects  have the potential of conserving 100 billion  litres of water and generate seven lakh  person days of employment.
Project Shakti continues to enhance  livelihoods in remote villages across India  through micro-enterprise opportunities.
By the end of 2014, we empowered over  70,000 women entrepreneurs (Shakti  Ammas) and they were complemented by  48,000 ‘Shaktimaans’, the male members  of the Shakti families.
Through another  project, Prabhat, we are serving  communities around our factories by  creating awareness about health and  Rs.
5,000 crores for the second successive  year.
With a final dividend of Rs.
9 per  share proposed by the Board of Directors  and an interim dividend of Rs.
6 per share,  the total dividend for the financial year  ending 31st March 2015 amounts to Rs.
15  per share.
In 2014, we launched ‘Dial Up the Big Q’, an  initiative to further step up quality of our  execution across all the levers of our  business, i.e.
brands and innovation,  go-to-market, continuous cost  improvement and our talent agenda.
We accelerated our pace of innovation  whilst delivering a significant  improvement in the success rate and  ‘on-time in-full’ delivery of key projects.
In  Personal Care, Axe launched a range of  body perfumes – Axe Signature,  TRESemmé continued the premiumisation  agenda with two new launches, Closeup  launched Diamond Attraction in the  premium whitening segment and Pond’s  launched the men’s range of products.
In  Home Care, Surf Excel re-launched Easy  Wash detergent and Surf bar, Vim  introduced a new tub format for its dish  wash bar and Pureit launched Ultima with  RO+UV technology.
In Beverages, Taj  Mahal launched ‘Flavour of Darjeeling’ in  the premium tea segment and the  re-launch of Lipton green tea met with  resounding success.
In line with our underlying objective of  serving diverse consumers and customers  across channels and geographies, we  reorganised our go-to-market operations  from the traditional four sales branches to  14 consumer clusters.
We also added a  fifth branch in Central India to accelerate  our growth in this relatively under- penetrated but high-growth market.
We  call this initiative ‘Winning In Many Indias’.
Our continued focus on cost effectiveness  and improving operational efficiencies  CHAIRMAN’S statement 1 Chairman’s Statement6 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information hygiene, building water conservation  capacities and improving livelihoods  through skill development programmes.
These initiatives, along with several  others, reaffirm our belief that addressing  societal needs and business growth go  hand-in-hand.
Our people are our biggest asset.
I firmly  believe that the growth of our business is  intrinsically linked with the growth of our  people.
We have always encouraged  diversity, agility and a performance-driven  organisational culture in which people give  their best and feel proud to be part of a  successful and caring company.
Our work  ethics and culture of leadership  development has enabled us to attract and  build the finest talent in the industry  across all levels of the organisation.

SOURCING SUSTAINABLE SOURCING  A dedicated team is responsible for HUL ’s  procurement programme, including agricultural raw  materials.
In 2014, we rolled out our Responsible  Sourcing Policy (RSP) as part of our commitment to  business integrity, openness, respect for universal  human rights and core labour principles.
1.
CONSUMERS INSIGHTS FOR INNOVATION  A fundamental requirement at HUL is to understand  our consumers.
We use focus groups and quantitative  studies and spend time with consumers in stores and  in their homes to find out what is important to them so  we can create products they need and want.
Our  Consumer Care line, Levercare, is also a rich source  of information.
We engage with our consumers  through digital communications and social media.
We  use all these data to identify and anticipate future  consumer trends and gain a competitive edge.
2.
INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY AT WORK Research and Development (R&D) is an engine of  sustainable growth.
At HUL, we benefit from  Unilever’s global R&D expertise.
There are 6,000 R&D  professionals in Unilever globally, who are responsible  for building brands through benefit-led innovation,  which is unlocked through science and technology.
This includes looking at long-term emerging science  and transforming science into technologies which are  used to design branded products.
3.
COLLABORATION PARTNER TO WIN  To meet our Vision we know we must work in  partnership with others, such as suppliers, agencies,  academia, governments and NGOs.
The big development in 2014 has been the launch of  the Partner To Win 2020 programme to create a  supplier ecosystem where partners work with us and  each other to create breakthroughs in products or  packaging to deliver the capacity, innovation and  sustainable solutions to meet our growth ambition.
700  tonnes LESS PLASTIC USE Design and material  optimisation implemented  across categories to  reduce packaging waste About Us8 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information OUR VALUE CHAIN Hindustan Unilever’s value chain – the  process by which we create brands,  products and ultimately shareholder value  – begins with acquiring insight into  consumers’ needs, which vary  considerably across India.
This knowledge helps us to target our  subsequent R&D activities and our  investments in innovation.
Bringing these innovations to market as  physical products is a core function of   our supply chain, one of the largest in   the country.
Our products are manufactured at our  factories situated across the length and  breadth of the country.
By sourcing large  amounts of raw materials sustainably, we  can protect scarce resources, ensure  security of supply for our business and  reduce price volatility while protecting the  environment and enhancing people’s lives,  which is at the heart of our Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan (USLP).
By the time manufacturing is under way,  our marketing teams work with our  category experts to define the complete  marketing mix, including communications  that make our brands come alive.
Our logistics operations move our  products to retailers and our go-to-market  teams ensure that we get enough of the  right products in the right price bracket in  the right sales channels for consumers  to buy.
7.
MARKETING GENERATING CONSUMER-LED GROWTH Through advertising, we ensure that our brands and  products are consumers’ first choice.
We use  multiple media to achieve cut-through in a highly  competitive and cluttered world.
Traditional media  channels continue to play a big part but digital  communications have revolutionised the way  marketing engages with people, creating entirely  new sales and marketing opportunities.
We create  our own entertainment content and this is  distributed, for example, by mobile devices.
6.
LOGISTICS CENTRALISED LOGISTICS EXPERTISE  How we move products from factories to customers  is the role of our logistics operation.
HUL is  continuously evolving its logistics network and  investing in warehousing infrastructure and  technology to support business growth, deliver  savings, reduce stocks, reduce carbon emissions  and improve customer service in an ever-changing  environment.
5.
MANUFACTURING  GLOBAL SCALE, LOCAL AGILITY  We make the majority of what we sell through a  network of manufacturing sites across India.
We have  invested significantly in our factories in recent years to  create an efficient, reliable and more sustainable  network.
We leverage the global scale of Unilever and  have the agility to meet local demands.
More eco- efficient production is helping us meet USLP targets.
For instance, all our factories had achieved zero  non-hazardous waste to landfill.
8.
SALES GO-TO-MARKET EXPERTISE We work closely with retailers to win in the market  place and make sure that our brands are always  available, properly displayed and in the right price  bracket.
Our go-to-market capability ensures that we  become the supplier of choice for our customers and  trade partners, through strong joint business planning  and in-store execution via Perfect Store programmes,  to help deliver sustainable sales growth.
This is  essential for us to be able to add premium brand  extensions to our product ranges, land product  innovations on the shelves, enter new geographies and  markets, and build our distribution strength to reach  new consumers.
About Us 9Annual Report 2014-15 Our business model OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY COME TOGETHER TO DELIVER VALUE FOR  SHAREHOLDERS.
HERE WE EXPLAIN THEIR ELEMENTS AND HOW THEY ARE COMBINED.
OUR CORE PURPOSE  MAKING SUSTAINABLE LIVING COMMONPLACE  Our business model starts with our core Purpose which is a clear  expression of what we believe to be the best long-term way for  Hindustan Unilever Limited to grow.
It is a simple Purpose to help  us meet changing consumer preferences and the challenges of a  volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.
KEY INPUTS  BRANDS, OPERATIONS, PEOPLE  Our business model works by combining three key inputs and  filtering them through the lens of the Unilever Sustainable Living  Plan (USLP).
Our brands have significant value and succeed  through products that meet the needs of consumers.
Our people  identify social and consumer needs to grow our brands, market  them, manufacture and distribute them.
Our operations  encompass procurement of raw material, manufacturing,  logistics, go-to-market and marketing.
We invest financial capital  to support all these assets and activities.
HOW WE DRIVE PROFIT  PROFITABLE VOLUME GROWTH, COST LEVERAGE +  EFFICIENCY, INNOVATION + MARKETING  INVESTMENT  HUL aims for a virtuous circle of growth.
Profitable volume  growth is driven by investment in innovation and brands to deliver  products that millions of consumers use every day.
We can  leverage this scale to spread fixed costs and improve profitability  while further investing in the business.
This investment funds  R&D and innovation to create new and improved products backed  by marketing to create even stronger brands.
This drives  profitable volume growth and the virtuous circle continues.
Our Business Model10 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information DELIVERING VALUE  OUR  CONSUMERS  Delivering our business goals  requires us to recruit, develop  and retain the right talent.
We  are determined to help all our  people to be the best they can  be, to help fulfil their potential  and the potential of the  business.
Training and  development are crucial at all  levels and we strive to create  a working environment that  respects the human rights  and interests of all our  employees.
Ensuring gender  equality is a fundamental part  of our approach while our  Purpose of making  sustainable living  commonplace is a  commitment that our people  can engage with every day  and make it a reality through  their work.
OUR  PEOPLE  SOCIETY  In 2014, many consumers  faced tough conditions as  economic uncertainty held  back growth around the  world.
Meanwhile,  consumption continues to be  linked to many of the world’s  biggest problems –  deforestation, climate  change, water scarcity,  malnutrition and unhealthy  diets.
However, each of our  categories continue to  innovate to meet the  challenges posed by these  trends and changing  consumer preferences, such  as products that are  sustainably sourced.
Acting alone we can only do  so much to make sustainable  living commonplace.
Acting in  partnership with others can  help bring about  transformational change at a  societal level to tackle the  world’s major social,  environmental and economic  issues.
By adopting a  leadership role, and working  with governments, NGOs,  suppliers and others, we are  influencing change on a  bigger scale.
We are  deepening our efforts where  we have scale, influence and  resources to create  transformational change:  sustainable agriculture and  smallholder farmers; and  water, sanitation and hygiene.

We are making good  progress with our first goal: to help more than a billion people  globally,  improve their health and well-being by 2020, reaching  over 110 million by the end of 2014, in India alone.
The progress on our second goal is more mixed.
We have  achieved zero non-hazardous waste to landfill from our factories,  and continue to make significant reductions in the greenhouse  gas (GHG) and water impacts of our manufacturing.
However, the  consumer element of our target to halve the water and GHG  impacts of our products remains a challenge.
On our third goal, we are making good progress.
We are now  sourcing more than half our agricultural raw materials  sustainably.
We have created 70,000 women micro-entrepreneurs  distributing our products in India while making progress on our  new commitments to enhance livelihoods across the value chain.
More on our performance against our targets can be found in our  online Sustainable Living Report 2014 published in May 2015.

OUTLOOK The global economic climate continues to be volatile, uncertain  and prone to geo-political risks.
The marked slowdown in global  markets is expected to continue in 2015.
The sharp fall in growth  of emerging markets, notably China, will continue to keep  commodity prices including oil, which is significantly lower than  last year, volatile.
The divergence in developed market growths as  a result of the US recovery is expected to add to the volatility in the  currency markets.
In this global backdrop, India is expected to perform better, aided  by improving macroeconomic fundamentals.
However, execution  of the reform agenda and kick starting the investment cycle will  be key determinants of India’s economic performance.
While  currently inflation is benign, upside pressures on inflation from  the vagaries of monsoon or sudden changes in the rupee, could  have a significant bearing on inflation.
Directors’ Report Directors’ Report46 47Hindustan Unilever Limited FMCG markets are expected to grow.
While consumer confidence  has increased, this has not yet translated into significant  improvement in FMCG market conditions.
There are a few green  shoots in market growths; however, uncertain global economic  environment, inflation and competitive intensity continue to pose  challenges.
While the near term conditions pose a challenge for  the economy, the medium to long term secular trends based on  rising incomes, aspirations, low consumption levels, are positive  and an opportunity for the FMCG sector.
Your Company, with its  brands, talent and investment in capabilities, is well placed to  benefit disproportionately from this opportunity 19.1.

Brief outline of the Company’s CSR Policy,  including overview of projects/  programmes  undertaken  Your Company is committed to operate and grow its  business in a socially responsible way.
The Company’s vision  is to grow its business, whilst reducing the environmental  impact of its operations and increasing its positive social  impact.
Your Company has embraced Unilever Sustainable  Living Plan (USLP) www.hul.co.in/sustainable-living/  which contributes to activities listed in the Schedule VII  of Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.
The USLP has  three global goals namely (i) help more than a billion people  take action to improve their health and well-being; (ii) halve  the environmental footprint of the making and use of the  products; and (iii) enhance the livelihoods of millions of  people while growing the  business.
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy of the  Company, as approved by the Board of the Directors, is  available on the Company’s website at www.hul.co.in   A brief overview of your Company’s projects is as given  below:  Improving Health and Well-being  •  Hand Washing Behaviour Change Programme: India  has the highest number of child deaths from diarrhoea  and pneumonia in the world with 6,09,000 children dying  each year before their 5th birthday from these diseases1.
Handwashing with soap can reduce diarrhoea diseases  by over 40% and respiratory infections by 30% 2.
Your Company’s Lifebuoy handwashing programme  promotes the benefits of handwashing with soap at  key times in schools and anganwadis (pre-school  centres).
Since 2010, Lifebuoy has reached more than  63 million people in India with its Behaviour Change  programme,  through a combination of comics, songs,  games and rewards which encourages children to  sustain good hand washing behaviours.
A  successful  pilot project last year in Thesgora village resulted  in scale-up of ‘Help a Child Reach 5’ programme in  2014 which led to addition of six more villages from  Chhindwara district in Madhya Pradesh under the  programme.
The programme reached out to hundreds  of new mothers and kids.
Your Company has also  entered into a partnership with Children’s Investment  Fund Foundation (CIFF) and the Government of Bihar  to promote Handwashing Behaviour Change among  children in Bihar with the aim to help prevent childhood  illnesses and mortality.
Your Company piloted the  programme in two districts of Bihar – Begusarai and  Khagaria, reaching out to nearly 1 million people.
Your  Company will now scale up the programme to cover  more districts in Bihar and reach out to more number  of people.
Over the next three years, 45 million people  are expected to benefit through this programme  •  Safe Drinking Water: The lack of safe drinking water is  a major public health issue, particularly in developing  countries where majority of diseases are waterborne.
The Pureit innovation addresses one of the biggest  technological challenges - that of making safe water  accessible and affordable for millions.
Pureit provides  1 litre of “As safe as boiled”™ water at a running cost  of just 30 paisa  without the hassles of boiling, without  the need of electricity or a continuous tap water supply.
Pureit is available at a price starting from Rs.
1,600/-.
However, to reach those at the “Bottom of the Pyramid”  who may not be able to afford the same, Pureit has  partnered with NGOs and Micro-Finance Institutions  which provide micro loans to low income consumers  on small monthly instalments.
Pureit in-home water  purifier has provided 55 billion litres of safe drinking  water in India as of end of 2014.
•  Domex Toilet Academy (DTA): Approximately, 792  million Indians live without improved sanitation, of  which some 597 million people continue to defecate in  the open3 .
These statistics clearly show that sanitation  conditions in India need improvement.
Your Company  is committed to help in gaining improved access to a  toilet and at the same time, drive behaviour change to  use the toilets.
One of the ways in which your Company  will do this is through the Domex Toilet Academy (DTA)  model.
The DTA is a market-based, entrepreneurial  model that provides people access to sanitation in  rural communities.
In partnership with the social  enterprise eKutir, the DTA programme trains local  micro-entrepreneurs who help execute the project  in their local communities by supplying and building  toilets.
Through DTA, toilets are made accessible and  affordable, while promoting the benefits of clean toilets  and good hygiene.
The objective of the programme is to  reduce the incidence of open defecation and improve  proper sanitation thereby promoting preventive  healthcare.
It also helps create awareness and drive  behaviour change.
Five DTAs are currently operating in  Maharastra, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.
Since 2014,  the programme has reached out to over 15,000 people  by building over 3,000 toilets in villages across Odisha,  Maharashtra and activities have expanded to Madhya  Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
The programme has  also trained more than 100 local entrepreneurs so far  to sell and maintain toilets.

Reducing Environmental Impact  •  Water Conservation Projects: According to the  estimates, by 2030, the supply of water in India will be  half its demand.
To understand and partake in meeting  this challenge, your Company set up Hindustan  Unilever Foundation (HUF) in 2010, a not-for-profit  company that anchors various community development  initiatives of Hindustan Unilever Limited.
HUF supports  national priorities for socio-economic development,  through its ‘Water for Public Good’ programme.
HUF,  alongwith its partners, has initiated 18 projects in more  than 4,000 villages of 82 districts in 13 states located  across 13 river basins in India since inception.
The  collective action of HUF and its partners has helped  in the creation of cumulative water potential of nearly   100 billion litres.
•  Environment & Sustainability - Supply Chain: Your  Company  has significantly reduced the  environmental  footprint in areas of greenhouse gases, water and waste  across manufacturing locations.
With regard to reducing  GHG emissions from manufacturing, the CO 2 emissions  per tonne of production in 2014 has reduced by 37%  compared to the 2008 baseline.
Major contribution to  this reduction has come from using alternative forms  of energy like biogenic fuels, solar photovoltaic energy,  etc.
in the manufacturing operations.
With respect to  reducing water use in the manufacturing process,  water usage (cubic meter per tonne of production) in  manufacturing operations reduced by 44% compared to  2008 baseline.
Major contribution to this reduction has  come from reusing treated water in gardening, toilet  flushing and harvesting captive rainwater collected on  roof tops.
Lastly, with regard to reducing waste from   manufacturing, 88% reduction was achieved in total  waste generation (kg per tonne of production) in 2014  over 2008 baseline.
Some of the initiatives which have  helped reduce the disposed waste footprint are usage of  spent coffee, tea waste in biomass boilers, composting  of ash and co-processing waste in cement industries.
All  manufacturing locations are zero non-hazardous  waste to landfills.
•  Solidaridad – Sustainability (Tea Procurement):   Your Company has a clear roadmap to achieve bold  commitment to source 100% of agricultural raw  materials sustainably by 2020.
Sustainable agriculture  means growing food in ways which sustain the soil,  minimise water and fertiliser use, protect biodiversity  and enhance farmers’ livelihoods.
The Company will  ensure that the agricultural raw materials that are   used such as tea, fruits and vegetables are sustainably  sourced.
The programme aims to move the Indian tea  industry producers into adopting a sustainability code  which shall promote sustainable agricultural practices,  improve productivity and reduce costs ensuring future  security of tea supply in India and also protect the  ecosystems (soil, water and bio-diversity) whilst  improving the quality of life for producers and workers.
Enhancing Livelihoods  •  Project Shakti: Project Shakti is an initiative to  financially empower rural women and create livelihood  opportunities for them.
It provides a regular income  stream for the Shakti entrepreneurs and their families.
HUL provides training on basic accounting, selling  skills, health & hygiene and relevant IT skills to Shakti  entrepreneurs and equips them with smart phones  which have been enabled with a mini Enterprise  Resource Package (ERP) which helps them to run  their business efficiently and further augment their  income.
Your Company has trained thousands of  Shakti Ammas across the villages in a bid to develop  an entrepreneurial mindset and make them financially  independent and more empowered.
Project Shakti has  empowered over 70,000 Shakti Ammas, complemented  by 48,000 Shaktimaans.
Shaktimaans are typically the  husbands or brothers of the Shakti Ammas.
They sell  products on bicycles in surrounding villages, covering a  larger area than Shakti Ammas can cover on foot.
•  Fair & Lovely Foundation: The Foundation identifies  academically exceptional girls from financially  challenged backgrounds and offers scholarships to  the deserving candidates.
To maintain integrity and  fairness the selection is done by a panel of eminent  personalities from diverse fields.
The Foundation  granted scholarships of Rs.1 crore to deserving 200 girl  students in the financial year 2014-15.
•  Livelihood Programme: Prabhat (Dawn) is a  programme which focuses on development of local  communities around the Company’s manufacturing  sites.
Under Prabhat’s Livelihood initiative, seven new  centers were launched in 2014 taking the total number  of centers to thirteen and candidate enrolments to over  3,000.
Twelve of the Company’s Skill Development  Centers are running in collaboration with LabourNet,  a training partner of the National Skill Development  Corporation (NSDC).
More than 1,500 people have  already been certified through the programme and over  500 of them either have a job or have been up-skilled or  are self employed.
•  Ankur: Ankur is a centre for special education for  differently abled children at Doom Dooma in Assam.
It was set up in 1993 by your Company’s Plantations  Division at Doom Dooma.
Ankur provides educational,  vocational and recreational activities to such differently-  abled children.
Others  •  Project Sunlight: Project Sunlight is your Company’s  initiative to build a world where everyone lives well and  lives sustainably.
It comprises a growing community of  Directors’ Report Directors’ Report52 53Hindustan Unilever Limited people who are actively working to make this world a better place for children and future generations.
It allows people to  contribute in the form of volunteering, spreading the message on social media, preaching and practising behaviour changing  habits or by just watching and sharing the Company’s videos.
In 2014, your Company took up two issues that are important for  India to create a brighter future – first, to stop littering and second to reduce water wastage.
Children were the key influencers  for both the initiatives.
•  Relief Funds / Donation: Your Company has always been at the forefront in responding to its call for national duty and has  contributed generous amounts for upliftment of communities hit by natural disasters.
It has done this through contribution to  Government relief funds such as Uttarakhand flood relief, J&K flood relief etc.
Last year, your Company also made a donation  to ‘Save the Children’ towards Mobile Health Units run by them for street children in Delhi.

Alternative Dispute Redressal Shareholders Long pending litigations involve significant investment as  monetary value of the disputed shares and accrued dividends /  other benefits are locked up unutilised till the dispute is settled.
Further, in terms of the requirements of the Companies Act, 1956,  such dividends / other specified incomes remaining unclaimed  / unpaid for a period of seven years are to be credited to the  Investor Education and Protection Fund and the Shareholders  are not entitled to claim the same thereafter.
Keeping the above in mind, the Company in 2004, pioneered  the mechanism of providing an alternate dispute redressal for  Shareholders to resolve the shares related disputes pending  before the courts / authorities by amicable settlement.
The  Company had started this unique initiative of organising  Alternative Dispute Redressal meetings wherein aggrieved  investors come face to face and get a chance to settle their  disputes, some of which were pending for years.
A number of Shareholders have availed the benefit of this  process and the Company through its various initiatives keeps  exploring the possibilities of settling such issues.
The process  helps the investors in releasing the locked up investment and  save their time consumed in contesting legal proceedings.
The  objective of this process is to facilitate quick resolution of the  dispute between the parties.
The Shareholders who are willing to avail the benefits of  Alternative Dispute Redressal mechanism may approach the  Investor Service Department of the Company at the Registered  Office of the Company.
Consumers / Customers In line with one of the Company’s key tenets of Consumer and  Customer Centricity, the Company commenced a process of  resolving consumer and customer disputes and grievances  through an alternative disputes redressal mechanism.
The  Company appointed four retired Judges of different High Courts,  one in each region, to act as Ombudsman to hear the Company’s  consumers and customers in a bid to resolve long pending  disputes.
The Ombudsman independently reviews the merits of  the complaint and decides on the issue.
The Company has taken  the view that the decision arrived at such disputes resolution  meetings, while being fully binding on the Company, may not be  binding on its consumers and customers and if they choose to  continue with litigation, they are free to do so.
These meetings  were held in all the four regions and achieved reasonable  success.
The Company believes that such independent dispute  resolution mechanism will further reinforce its commitment and  credibility with its consumers and also set new benchmarks for  the industry.
The Company has also set a consumer care helpline ‘Levercare’,  to help consumers reach the Company for their grievances,  suggestions, ideas and to help brands reach out to consumers.

S. N. Ananthasubramanian & Co S. N. Ananthasubramanian Thane: 7th May, 2015 FCS : 4206   CP :1774 Note : This report should be read with the letter of even date  by the Secretarial Auditors, which is available on the website of  the Company www.hul.co.in Standalone Standalone88 89Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2014-15 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION : ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED (EVA) What is EVA ?
Traditional approaches to measuring Shareholder’s Value  Creation’ have used parameters such as earnings capitalisation,  market capitalisation and present value of estimated future cash  flows.
Extensive equity research has established that it is not  earnings per se, but VALUE that is important.
A measure called  ‘Economic Value Added’ (EVA) is increasingly being applied to  understand and evaluate financial performance *EVA = Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) - Cost of  Capital Employed (COCE), where, NOPAT = Profits after depreciation and taxes but before interest  costs.
NOPAT thus represents the total pool of profits available  on an ungeared basis to provide a return to lenders and  shareholders, and  COCE = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) x Average  Capital Employed *Cost of debt is taken at the effective rate of interest applicable  to an “AAA” rated Company like HUL for a short term debt, net  of taxes.
We have considered a pre tax rate of 8.42% for 2014-15  (9.63% for 2013-14) *Cost of Equity is the return expected by the investors to  compensate them for the variability in returns caused by  fluctuating earnings and share prices.
Cost of Equity = Risk free return equivalent to yield on long term  Government Bonds (taken at 7.74% for 2014-15) + Market risk premium (taken at 4.42%) (x) Beta variant for the  Company, (taken at 0.719) where Beta is a relative measure of  risk associated with the Company’s shares as against the market  as a whole.
Thus HUL ’s cost of equity = 7.74% + 4.42% (x) 0.719 = 10.91% What does EVA show?
EVA is residual income after charging the Company for the cost  of capital provided by lenders and shareholders.It represents the  value added to the shareholders by generating operating profits  in excess of the cost of capital employed in the business.
When will EVA increase?
EVA will increase if: a.
Operating profits can be made to grow without employing  more capital, i.e.
greater efficiency.
b.
Additional capital’s invested in projects that return more  than the cost of obtaining new capital, I.e.
profitable growth.
c.  Capital is curtailed in activities that do not cover the cost of  capital, i.e liquidate unproductive capital EVA in practice at Hindustan Unilever Limited.
In Hindustan Unilever Limited, the goal of sustainable long term  value creation for our shareholders is well understood by all the  business groups.
Measures to evaluate business performance  and to set targets take into account this concept of value creation.

Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off  norm adopted by the Company have been reflected as “0.00” in  the relevant notes in these financial statements.

Revenue recognition        Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant  risks and rewards of ownership in the goods are transferred to  the buyer as per the terms of the contract, the Company retains  no effective control of the goods transferred to a degree usually  associated with ownership and no significant uncertainty exists  regarding the amount of the consideration that will be derived  from the sale of goods.
Sales are recognised net of trade  discounts, rebates, sales taxes and excise duties (on goods  manufactured and outsourced).
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and  premium on sale of import licenses, and lease license fee are  recognised on accrual basis.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on  agreements/arrangements with the customers as the service  is performed using the proportionate completion method when  no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the  consideration that will be derived from rendering the service and  is recognised net of service tax, as applicable.
Interest on investments is recognised on a time proportion basis  taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest.
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to  receive dividend is established.
2.3.
Expenditure        Expenses are accounted on accrual basis.
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Development costs of products are  also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product’s  technical feasibility and other criteria as set out in paragraph 44  of AS 26 – ‘Intangible Assets’ have been established, in which  case such expenditure is capitalised.
The amount capitalised  comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated  on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating, producing and  making the asset ready for its intended use.
Fixed assets utilised  for research and development are capitalised and depreciated in  accordance with the policies stated for Tangible assets.
2.4.
Tangible assets        Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible asset are  added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits  from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard  of performance.
Items of tangible assets that have been retired from active use  and are held for disposal are stated at the lower of their net book  value and net realisable value and are shown separately in the  financial statements under “Other current assets”.
Any expected  loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and  Loss.
Tangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of  Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses  arising from disposal of tangible assets which are carried at cost  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight  line method at the rates prescribed under Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 with the exception of the following:  Standalone Standalone98 99Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2014-15 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2015  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) -  plant and equipment is depreciated over 4 to 21 years  based on the technical evaluation of useful life done by the  management.
-  assets costing Rs.
5,000 or less are fully depreciated in the  year of purchase.
2.5.
Intangible assets         Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis as  per rates mentioned below:   Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/Trademarks 25% Computer Software 20% 2.6.
Impairment          Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date  as to whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible  and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose of assessing  impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups  of assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
If any such  indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the  individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
Assets whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount  are written down to the recoverable amount by recognising  the impairment loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s or cash  generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use.
Value in  use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected  to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal  at the end of its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each  Balance Sheet date as to whether there is any indication that  an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting  periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7.
Investments         Investments are classified into current and non-current  investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower of cost  and fair value.
Non-current investments are stated at cost.
A  provision for diminution is made to recognise a decline, other  than temporary, separately for each individual non-current  investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be  held for not more than one year from the date on which such  investments are made, are classified as “Current investments”.
All other investments are classified as “Non-current  investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to  be occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of  the Company, have been classified as investment property.
Investment properties are carried at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation on the building component of the investment  property is provided in line with the policy on tangible assets.
2.8.
Inventories        Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average basis.
The net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Finished goods  and work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion  costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition.
2.9.
Trade receivables and Loans and advances   Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.
2.10.
Provisions and Contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  Balance Sheet date and are not discounted to its present value.
These are reviewed at each year end date and adjusted to reflect  the best current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible  obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will  be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of  the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events  where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made.
2.11.
Retirement/post retirement benefits Defined contribution plans         Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as  employees’ state insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation  scheme, employee pension scheme etc.
are charged as an  expense based on the amount of contribution required to be  Standalone Standalone100 101Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2014-15 NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2015  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) made as and when services are rendered by the employees.
Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain  employees, is made to a government administered fund and  charged as an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The  above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes  as the Company has no further defined obligations beyond the  monthly contributions.
Defined benefit plans         In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are  made to a trust administered by the Company.
The interest rate  payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the  statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by  the Company.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest  earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Company also provides for retirement/post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect  of certain employees), compensated absences (in respect of  certain employees) and medical.
The Company’s liability towards  such defined benefit plans is determined based on valuations,  as at the Balance Sheet date, made by independent actuaries  using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and  losses in respect of the defined benefit plans are recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
The classification of the Company’s net obligation into current  and non- current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits  Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring, are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when: a) the  Company has a present obligation as a result of past event;  b) a  reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation;  and c) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
2.12.
Income taxes Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the applicable tax  rates and tax laws.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences, subject  to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred tax  assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using  the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are  recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there  is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income  will be available against which such deferred tax assets can  be realised.
In situations where the Company has unabsorbed  depreciation or carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax assets  are recognised only if there is virtual certainty supported by  convincing evidence that they can be realised against future  taxable profits.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at each Balance Sheet date for any write down, as  considered appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when  there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the  liability on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to  set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
2.13.
Foreign currency translations  Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange  rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the  translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Forward exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end  on account of firm commitment transactions are marked to  market and the losses, if any, are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss and gains are ignored in accordance with the  announcement of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  on ‘Accounting for Derivatives’ issued in March 2008.
2.14.
Operating leases        Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of  ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating  leases.
The Company is both a lessee and a lessor under such  arrangements.
Payments and receipts under such leases are  charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  straight line basis over the primary period of the lease.
2.15.
Segment reporting        The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are  in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for the  Company.
Further,         a)  Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based on  the transaction price agreed to between segments which is  primarily market based.

2.16.
Cash and cash equivalents In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include  cash in hand, term deposits with banks and other short-term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  months or less.
2.17.
Earnings per share        Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
The weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods presented  is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding  change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted  earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to  equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares  outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all  dilutive potential equity shares.
2.18.
Employee share based payments     Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for under  the intrinsic value method as per the accounting treatment  prescribed by Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee  Stock Purchase Guidelines, 1999, issued by Securities and  Exchange Board of India and the Guidance Note on Employee  Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
2.19.
Use of estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  the generally accepted accounting principles requires that the  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of  contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the  reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
2.20.
Government Grants        Government Grants and subsidies are received and recognised  after fulfilling the conditions attached to them.
Government  grants are of the nature of promoters’ contribution and are  credited to Capital Subsidy which is treated as part of Reserves  and Surplus.

(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) 157 Annual Report 2014-15 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports Consolidated d)  Associate: S ection 129 (3) of the Companies Act, 2013, requires preparation of consolidated financial statement of the company and of all the  subsidiaries including associate company and joint venture businesses in the same form and manner as that of its own.
Accounting  Standard (AS) 23 on Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements defines Associate Company as an  enterprise in which an entity has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of that party.
It mentions  that if an investing party holds, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, 20 per cent or more of the voting power of the enterprise,  it is presumed that the investing party does have significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case The Company holds investments in the below entities which by share ownership are deemed to be an associate company:  i)  C omfund Financial Services India Limited where the Company has 24% equity holding.
This is a NBFC set up between HUL and  a partner company, currently dormant.
ii)   Aquagel Chemicals (Bhavnagar) Private Limited where the Company has 26% equity and 26% preference capital holding.
This is  a Company engaged in Silica business.
iii)  Hi-Tech Surfactants Limited where the Company has 33% equity holding.
This is a job-worker for HUL undertaking conversion  activities for laundry business.
However the Company does not exercise significant influence in any of the above entities, as demonstrated below :     i) The Company does not have any representation on the Board of Directors or corresponding governing body of the investee.
ii)  The Company does not participate in policy making process.
iii)  The Company does not have any material transactions with the investee.
iv)  The Company does not interchange any managerial personnel.
v) The Company does not provide any essential technical information to the investee.
vi)  As these are not investments strategic to the core business of HUL, these are intended to be divested/liquidated in the near  future.
As the interests in above enterprises originated for investment purposes and are not of sufficient proportions for the Company to be  able to control or exercise significant influence on decisions of the investee, these are not being construed as associate companies for  the purpose of consolidation and therefore these have not been consolidated in the financial statement of the company.

The financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries,  controlled trust and the joint venture (on a proportionate basis)  have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together  the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses.
Intra group balances and intra group transactions and  resulting unrealised profits are eliminated in full.
Unrealised  losses resulting from intra group transactions are also eliminated  unless cost cannot be recovered.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and  other events in similar circumstances.
The accounting policies  adopted in the preparation of financial statements are consistent  with those of previous year.
The difference between the cost of investment in the subsidiaries,  and the Company’s share of net assets at the time of acquisition of  share in the subsidiaries is recognised in the financial statement  as Goodwill or Capital Reserve as the case may be.
Minority Interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries  is identified and presented in the consolidated Balance  Sheet separately from liabilities and equity of the Company’s  shareholders.
Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries  consists of: (a)  The amount of equity attributable to minority at the date on  which investment in a subsidiary is made; and (b)  The minority share of movements in equity since the date  parent subsidiary relationship came into existence.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non- current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other  criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.
Based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition  of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash  equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 12  months for the purpose of current/non-current classification of  assets and liabilities.
Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off  norm adopted by the Group have been reflected as “0.00” in the  relevant notes in these consolidated financial statements.

Sales are recognised net of trade  discounts, rebates, sales taxes and excise duties (on goods  manufactured and outsourced).
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and  premium on sale of import licences, and lease license fee are  recognised on accrual basis.
Income from Property Development Activity is recognised in  terms of arrangements with developers, where applicable.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on  agreements/arrangements with the customers as the service  is performed using the proportionate completion method when  no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the  consideration that will be derived from rendering the service and  is recognised net of service tax, as applicable.
Interest on investments is recognised on a time proportion  basis taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of  interest.
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to  receive dividend is established.
2.3  Expenditure        Expenses are accounted on accrual basis.
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Development costs of products are  also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless a product’s  technical feasibility and other criteria set out in paragraph 44  of AS 26 – ‘Intangible assets’ have been established, in which  case such expenditure is capitalised.
The amount capitalised  comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or allocated  on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating, producing and  making the asset ready for its intended use.
Fixed assets utilised  for research and development are capitalised and depreciated in  accordance with the policies stated for Tangible assets.

(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) 159 Annual Report 2014-15 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports Consolidated Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible asset are  added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits  from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard  of performance.
Items of tangible assets that have been retired from active use and  are held for disposal are stated at the lower of their net book value  and net realisable value and are shown separately in the financial  statements under “Other current assets”.
Any expected loss is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Tangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of  Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses  arising from disposal of tangible assets which are carried at cost  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight  line method at the rates prescribed under Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 with the exception of the following:   - plant and equipment is depreciated over 2 to 21 years based on  the technical evaluation of useful life done by the management.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis as  per rates mentioned below: Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/Trademarks 25% Computer Software 25% 2.6 Impairment        Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date  as to whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible  and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose of assessing  impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups  of assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
If any such  indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the  individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
Assets whose  carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount are written down  to the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment loss  as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Recoverable  amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s net  selling price  and its value in use.
Value in use is the present  value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the  continuing use of an asset and from its disposal  at the end of  its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet  date as to whether there is any indication that an impairment  loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods may no  longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7 Investments        Investments are classified into current and non-current  investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower of cost  and fair value.
Non-current investments are stated at cost.
A  provision for diminution is made to recognise a decline, other  than temporary, separately for each individual non-current  investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be  held for not more than one year from the date on which such  investments are made, are classified as “Current investments”.
All other investments are classified as “Non-current  investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to be  occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of the  company, have been classified as investment property.
Investment  properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation on the  building component of the investment property is provided in line  with the policy on tangible assets.
2.8 Interests in joint venture       Interests in Jointly controlled entities (incorporated Joint  Venture) are accounted for using proportionate consolidation  method.
2.9 Inventories         Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average basis.
The net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Finished goods  and work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion  costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition.
2.10 Trade receivables and Loans and advances    Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.

(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) 160 Hindustan Unilever LimitedConsolidated embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  Balance Sheet date and are not discounted to its present value.
These are reviewed at each year end date and adjusted to reflect  the best current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible  obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will  be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of  the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events  where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made.
2.12 Retirement/post retirement benefits     Defined contribution plans         Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employees’  state insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation scheme,  employee pension scheme etc.
are charged as an expense based  on the amount of contribution required to be made as and when  services are rendered by the employees.
Group’s provident  fund contribution, in respect of certain employees, is made to a  government administered fund and charged as an expense to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
The above benefits are classified  as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Group has no further  defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
Defined benefit plans         In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions  are made to a trust administered by the Group.
The interest rate  payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the  statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good  by the Group.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest  earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Group also provides for retirement/post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect  of certain employees), compensated absences (in respect of  certain employees) and medical.

Actuarial gains and  losses in respect of the defined benefit plans are recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they  arise.
The classification of the Group’s net obligation into current and  non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits         Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring, are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when: a) the  Group has a present obligation as a result of past event;  b) a  reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation;  and c) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
2.13 Income taxes        Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the applicable tax  rates.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences,  subject to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred  tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax  assets are recognised and carried forward only to the extent  that there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred tax assets  can be realised.
In situations where the Group has unabsorbed  depreciation or carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax assets  are recognised only if there is virtual certainty supported by  convincing evidence that they can be realised against future  taxable profits.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is  reviewed at each Balance Sheet date for any write down, as  considered appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when  there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the  liability on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to  set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.

Payments and receipts under such leases are  charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  straight line basis over the primary period of the lease.
2.16 Segment reporting        The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are in  conformity with the accounting policies adopted for the Group.
Further,        a)  Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based on  the transaction price agreed to between segments which is  primarily market based.
b)  Revenue and expenses have been identified to segments on  the basis of their relationship to the operating activities of  the segment.
Revenue and expenses, which relate to the  Group as a whole and are not allocable to segments on a  reasonable basis, have been included under “Un-allocated  corporate expenses net of un-allocated income”.
2.17 Cash and cash equivalents        In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include  cash in hand, term deposits with banks and other short-term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  months or less.
2.18 Earnings per share        Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
The weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods presented  is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding  change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted  earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to  equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares  outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all  dilutive potential equity shares.
2.19 Employee share based payments      Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for under  the intrinsic value method as per the accounting treatment  prescribed by Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee  Stock Purchase Guidelines, 1999, issued by the Securities and  Exchange Board of India and the Guidance Note on Employee  Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants Of India.
2.20 Use of estimates        The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  the generally accepted accounting principles requires that the  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of  contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during  the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those  estimates.
2.21 Government Grants        Government Grants and subsidies are received and recognised  after fulfilling the conditions attached to them.

Share  certificates of face value of Rs.
10/- are no longer  tradeable in the market and will not be accepted by  the DPs for demat.
Members who still hold Share  Certificates with a face value of Rs.
10/- each are  therefore requested to forward the same to M/s.
Karvy  Computershare Private Limited (the Registrar), along  with a request letter signed by all the holders for  exchange of Share Certificate(s).

The Companies Act, 2013 and  Rules framed thereunder governing e-communication  have been notified and the Company shall be sending  notice, documents, financial statements, etc.
through  electronic mode to the Members who have provided their  email address to the Company or Depository Participants.
Members may send request for hard copy of such notices,  documents, financial statements, etc.

Consolidation of Multiple Folios Members are requested to consolidate their  shareholdings under multiple folios, to save  themselves from the burden of receiving multiple  communications as also to facilitate one point tracking  of all corporate benefits on their shares.
PAN Requirement for Transfer  of Shares in Physical Form SEBI has mandated submission of Permanent  Account Number (PAN) for securities  market transactions and off market / private  transactions involving transfer of shares of  listed companies in physical form.
