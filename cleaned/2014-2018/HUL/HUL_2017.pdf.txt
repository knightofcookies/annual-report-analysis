Our Purpose inspires our Vision – to accelerate growth in our business, while reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our positive social  impact.
We want our business to grow, but we recognise that growth, at the expense of people or the environment, is both unacceptable and commercially  unsustainable.
Sustainable growth is the only acceptable model for our business.
Our Purpose and Vision combine a commercial imperative to succeed against competition, with the changing attitudes and expectations of consumers.
This Annual Report and Accounts explains how, in 2016-17, we have continued to pursue our Purpose and work towards making our Vision a reality.
During the year, we continued to deliver growth that is consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible.
This track record of long-term success is  underpinned by the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP), which helps us manage risk, inspires brand purpose and innovation, drives down costs to  improve returns and builds trust among consumers across our categories and operations.
Our success depends on the expertise and talent of our people.
They are constantly challenged by an environment that remains volatile, uncertain,  complex and ambiguous.
Digitisation is impacting all aspects of life.
At the same time, it is getting easier to enter our industry.
The market is fragmenting  as a result of changes in consumer habits, sales channels and the media.
This is why the Company is also changing through the business transformation  programme, Connected 4 Growth, which we started to implement during 2016.
It is creating a business which is more consumer and customer-centric,  faster, more efficient and empowered so that our people can meet these challenges with the necessary resources.
As part of this change, we are adopting new ways of working to be more entrepreneurial to complement our existing category strategies.
In turn, these  clearly-defined strategies across our four categories ensure that the Company has a well-balanced and resilient portfolio relevant to meeting our  Purpose and Vision.

Fair & Lovely Further binding the category strategies together are our Compass pillars  which define how Unilever wins with consumers.
They are:  •	 Winning	with	Brands	and	Innovation	 •	 Winning	in	the	Marketplace	 •	 Winning	through	Continuous	Improvement	 •	 Winning	with	People	 Underpinning the Compass is the USLP which is the foundation of our  business.
By delivering social and environmental benefits throughout our  business, we drive our growth, which in turn drives our ability to improve  the lives and opportunities of people, everywhere.
The USLP contributes directly to consistent growth by helping manage  risk, for example, through the supply of sustainably-grown agricultural  raw materials, such as vegetables in our Foods brands.
This is especially  important as climate change affects rainfall.
It drives growth that is  competitive, by stimulating innovation to create brands that meet the  growing consumer demand for sustainable products.
Profitable growth  is achieved by reducing costs through sustainable production methods in  our factories, which reduce waste, use fewer raw materials and consume  less energy.
Responsible growth is an outcome of the trust that we earn  by acting ethically and responsibly.
Each of our four category strategies includes specific priorities aimed at  growing sales and delivering improved financial metrics, such as margin  and cash flow.
Our categories face numerous and increasingly complex challenges as  the industry experiences rapid fragmentation and disruption.
However,  our Compass pillars provide strategic responses to help drive growth  ahead of the market.
Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and  mitigate the risks generated by our business.
In doing so, we take an  embedded approach to risk management, which puts risk and opportunity  assessment at the core of the leadership team agenda, which is where,  we believe, it should be.

It was yet another difficult  year for the global economy, characterised by low growth and geopolitical  uncertainties.
In India, rural demand continued to be sluggish in the early  part of the year on the back of two consecutive poor monsoons.The overall  market showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the year but faced a  temporary slowdown in November due to demonetisation.
In this challenging business environment, Hindustan Unilever Limited  (HUL) delivered a resilient performance in 2016-17.
This was enabled  by our 4G model of growth - consistent, competitive, profitable and  responsible growth.
We believe that this model, particularly in times of  uncertainty, is in the best long-term interest of all our stakeholders and a  good indication of a robust strategy.
In the year under review, our Domestic Consumer business grew 4% with  1% underlying volume growth.
EBITDA margin expanded by 38 bps and  saw an improvement for the sixth consecutive year.
Profit after tax before  exceptional items, PAT (bei), grew by 3% to ` 4247 Crores and Net Profit  at ` 4490 Crores was up 9%.
The strong track record of cash generation  was sustained.
The Board of Directors have proposed a final dividend of  ` 10 per share, subject to the approval of the shareholders at the Annual  General Meeting.
Together with an interim dividend of ` 7 per share, the  total dividend for the financial year ended 31st March, 2017 amounts to  ` 17 per share.
Each of our businesses had an important role to play in delivering these  strong results.
In Home Care, growth was driven by premium Fabric Wash  as Surf excel sustained its volume-led growth momentum and remains  the biggest brand in the Company portfolio.
Vim liquid continued to drive  market development of the emerging premium household cleaning  segment.
The Water portfolio was expanded with the launch of the  Reverse Osmosis (RO) range and was well-received by consumers.
The Personal Care business continued to lead trends across all categories  with a particularly strong performance in Hair Care and Lakmé colour  cosmetics.
In addition to driving our core business, we strengthened  our presence in fast-growing segments of the market.
We led the  premiumisation of the Skin Care market with new launches on all our  skin brands –Lakmé, Fair & Lovely and Pond’s.
In the growing ‘naturals’  segment, we launched a new and expanded range of authentic Ayurvedic  Personal Care products under the LEVER Ayush brand name.
Similarly,  we entered the Baby segment with the launch of Baby Dove.
Our Foods business continued its focus on strong market building  initiatives.

One of the major strengths of your Company is the relentless focus on  execution and productivity and this helped us to sustain brand investments  at competitive levels, while significantly improving margins.
Our  ‘Winning in Many Indias’ (WIMI) organisational initiative has made us  even more agile and responsive to a rapidly evolving marketplace with  intensified competition, channel fragmentation and an increasingly  segmented consumer base.
Technology and mobile connectivity are rapidly changing consumer  behaviour and business processes.
We continued to lead the digital  transformation within our organisation and leverage our IT capabilities  to drive competitive advantage.
We grew strongly in the fast emerging  e-commerce channel even as we adopted sophisticated IT solutions to  improve our reach and service to millions of small retailers across the  length and breadth of India.
Technology is also enabling us to better  understand our consumers.
For instance, our Consumer and Market  Insights group has created a People Data Centre that analyses trends  from social media, consumer care-lines and digital marketing to turn  millions of ‘conversations’ into business decisions that optimise sales  and revenue.
Our Sales and Marketing initiatives were ably supported by our world-class  Supply Chain.
In 2016, we set up a new state-of-the-art manufacturing  facility in Doom Dooma, Assam.
This project, christened ‘Project Rhino’,  went from concept to commissioning in just ten months and is an excellent  example of operational excellence and a relentless bias for action.
Even as we expand our operations, we remain equally committed to the  Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and driving our environmental  and social agenda through our brands and corporate actions.
Lifebuoy,  Domex and Pureit continued to lead our initiatives in the areas of hygiene,  sanitation and safe drinking water.

Our efforts in the  area of health and well-being reached over 130 million people by the end  of 2016.
In line with our USLP goals, we took significant steps to further reduce  waste, water consumption and energy usage in our factories and offices.
The share of renewable energy used by us increased to 28% through  several innovative initiatives such as converting our agricultural process  waste into consumable fuel.
In our Sumerpur unit, we are using solar  energy that meets 80% of power requirement for most of the daylight  hours.
This increase in use of renewable energy and reduction in  energy consumption has helped in reducing the carbon foot-print of our  manufacturing locations by 13% over the previous year.
Equally, initiatives  such as reuse of treated effluent water and rain water utilisation have  helped in lowering water consumption across our factories by 9% over  the previous year.
In the last five years, per tonne of production, our  energy consumption has reduced by over 30% and water consumption  has reduced by 40%.
None of these achievements would have been possible without the  passion and commitment of our employees - our biggest asset.
During  2016, we launched a major initiative – ‘Connected 4 Growth’, which strives  to further empower our people and creates an organisation that is even  more consumer and customer-centric, faster and more efficient.
I am pleased to report that our focus on Human Resources development,  yet again, ensured that we are chosen as the ‘No.
1 Employer of Choice’  by students across premier B-schools in the Nielsen survey.
We have  been ranked in the Top 10 by ‘The Best Companies for Women in India’  (BCWI) Study 2016.
These are all recognitions of our ability to attract and  retain the best talent and our commitment to a diverse and inclusive work  culture.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee as  well as those who work with us across the value chain for their unstinting  support and hard work in the service of our Company.
I would also like  to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued trust in the business.

Kalpana morparia Independent Director 8 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Our sustainable business model drives growth that is consistent by  reducing risks, is more competitive through inspiring innovations that  help us grow, is more profitable by reducing costs and is more responsible  – leading to enhanced trust in our business.
The three big goals* of the USLP – to help more than one billion people  improve their health and well-being by 2020; to halve the environmental  impact of our products across the value chain by 2030; and to enhance the  livelihoods of millions as we grow our business by 2020 – are integrated  into our business model.
From sustainable sourcing of our agricultural  raw materials to sustainable manufacturing, to marketing brands with  purpose – the USLP is our blueprint for achieving our Vision.
We invest in innovation and brands, which create profitable volume  growth.
Our scale spreads fixed overheads, improving profitability further,  and this profitable growth allows us to reinvest, generating more free  cash flow which can be further invested in brands and innovation which in  turn drives more profitable volume growth.
ConSumer InSIGHt  Our business model begins with consumer insight which informs brand  innovation.
Accurate insight is critical to understanding how markets  are changing.
We forge relationships with consumers through insights  from focus groups, quantitative studies and regular market visits.
Digital  research adds one-on-one sophistication while new lines of communication  are opening through direct-to-consumer channels, allowing closer  relationships.
Our Consumer and Market Insight (CMI) group helps us  prioritise growth opportunities.
Through CMI, we monitor data about  consumption patterns and social media dialogue to inform action, including  sustainability insights, which drive product innovations and behaviour  change programmes.
CollAborAtIon  Collaboration is critical to our success.
We are open to external ideas  and adept at capturing and integrating their benefits.
The USLP involves  working with government and NGOs.
Our Supply Chain operates the  Partner to Win programme to encourage innovations from suppliers.
This  furthers innovation-led growth and helps us in our USLP commitment  to halve the environmental impact of our products across their lifecycle.
InnoVAtIon  Our innovations use insights and technologies to deliver brand-led  benefits which meet the latest trends.
Our innovation is increasingly  responsive to local needs, landing results faster into the market.

loGIStICS  Our Logistics Team is responsible for moving the goods produced at our  factories and delivering them to our customers.
We are now investing in  automation and modernisation of our warehouses.
Our centralised Ultra  control tower is now fully operational to manage our logistics operations  which will help in optimisation of cost, improve service, conserve cash  and reduce our carbon footprint.
Given the vast distribution and Supply  Chain network, Goods and Services Tax (GST) is likely to unlock huge value  potential and hence, as a first phase, we are fully ready with the logistics  road map to optimise warehousing and inventory carrying cost.
mArKetInG  We have been mapping consumers’ purchase journeys in the digital world,  using data to delve deeper and segment consumers more accurately.
This  enables us to deliver more relevant, authentic and effective marketing  content in real-time using the full range of digital communications.
Sustainability is an integral part of our brand strategies.
We want all of  our top brands to be Sustainable Living brands, which combine a strong  purpose delivering a social or environmental benefit, with products  contributing to at least one of our USLP goals.
CuStomer DeVelopment  Our Customer Development eco-system encompasses capturing the  demand, fulfillment of demand and generation of demand.
As far as demand  capturing is concerned, our focus has been on driving quality of coverage and  increasing the assortment using data centric and analytical approach.
With  respect to demand fulfillment, process and technology interventions have  been used for improving service and efficiencies.
For demand-generation,  our strategy encompasses winning in traditional trade in both open and  closed formats, winning in ‘route to market’ as well as winning in emerging  channels like Modern Trade and e-commerce.
We work closely with retailers,  online through e-commerce and in stores.

This will continue to be our source of competitive advantage.
DelIVerInG VAlue For our StAKeHolDerS  Key to our sustainable business model is our stakeholders.
To succeed, we  need to engage and work in partnership with them.
They include customers  and consumers; investors; suppliers; governments, regulators and  legislators; NGOs and charities; scientific institutions and academia; and  other organisations in the business world, including peer companies and  trade associations.
Some of our stakeholders are direct participants in our  value chain and are integral to our ability to deliver consistent, competitive,  profitable and responsible growth.
Others influence how we do business  by setting the laws and norms in our country.
In turn, we deliver value to  our stakeholders in various forms.
Stakeholder engagement is essential in  delivering our Compass strategy and in tackling the issues addressed by  the USLP.
We also combine action in our business with external advocacy  and by jointly working with governments, NGOs and others through  ‘transformational change’ partnerships.
By working together, we believe  that fundamental change is possible in the near-term.

7 The members of the Company in the Annual General Meeting held on  4th April, 2008 had approved the overall limits of the Managerial  Remuneration for Managing Director(s) / Whole-time Director(s) of the  Company.
The said resolution was further modified by the resolution  passed in the Annual General Meeting held on 23rd July, 2012 by revision  in the maximum remuneration limits of Managing Director(s).
During the year,  a detailed review of the Reward framework was undertaken on  the basis of the following key principles: •	 Simplify	reward; •	 Ensure	 consistent	 alignment	 of	 performance	 measures	 with	 Company’s	strategy;	and •	 Increase	the	timeframe	over	which	incentives	are	delivered.
One of the principles of the revised Reward framework is to streamline  the remuneration structure by simplifying elements of overall reward.
The simplification in remuneration structure will result in some elements  of remuneration being merged with the basic salary and other heads of  remuneration.
As a consequence of this proposed change in remuneration  structure, the present basic salary limits will be exceeded.
Accordingly, it is now proposed to modify the maximum limits of  remuneration of managerial personnel including Managing and   Whole-time Director(s) of the Company as under: (` in Lakhs) Description Existing Maximum limits  (per annum) in terms of the  Approval of Shareholders Proposed Maximum limits  (per annum) Salary Perquisites Salary Perquisites In case  of CEO/ Managing  Director(s) 290 As per the Rules  of the Company  and within limits  of Section 197 of  the Act 400 As per the Rules  of the Company  and within limits of  Section 197 of the Act In case  of other  Whole-time  Director(s)  120 As per the Rules  of the Company  and within limits  of Section 197 of  the Act 250 As per the Rules  of the Company  and within limits of  Section 197 of the Act It may be noted that while the increase in overall effective  remuneration is only marginal, the need to revise the present limits of   basic salary for Managing Director(s) and Whole-time Director(s)  is necessitated primarily because of merger of other elements of  remuneration with basic salary and consequent increase in the basic  salary.
It may be noted that the proposed revised limits are enabling  in nature and should remain valid for some years in the future.
It may also be noted that the existing limits were approved in April, 2008 and  are proposed to be amended now after a period of nine years.
other terms and conditions:  a) Performance linked bonus / commission on profits  The Managing Director(s) / Whole-time Director(s) shall be paid  Performance Linked Bonus as may be decided by the Board of Directors  or a Committee thereof from year to year, based on achievement of  such performance parameters as may be determined by Board of  Directors or a Committee thereof from time to time provided that the  total remuneration including salary and perquisites paid to all the   17 Annual Report 2016-17 Hindustan Unilever Limited Reports Financial StatementsOverview Managing / Whole-time Director(s) shall not exceed the limits laid down  under Section 197 read with Schedule V of the Companies Act, 2013.  b) Perquisites/ Benefits  The Managing / Whole-time Director(s) shall be entitled to perquisites  like the benefit of rent free accommodation for self, spouse and family  or house rent allowance in lieu thereof, company car with chauffeur,  telephone at residence/cellular phones, statutory contribution to  retirement funds, club membership fees, medical coverage, overseas  medical expenses, leave encashment and long service award and  other benefits/allowances in accordance with the scheme(s) and  rule(s) of the Company from time to time, for the aforesaid benefits.
The total remuneration and perquisites / benefits contemplated  above, including contribution towards PF / superannuation fund,  annuity fund, gratuity fund, etc.
payable to all the Managing /  Whole-time Director(s) of the Company shall not exceed 5%, where  there is only one Managing / Whole-time Director(s), and 10% where  there are more than one Managing / Whole-time Director(s), of the  profits of the Company calculated in accordance with Section 198 of  the Companies Act, 2013. c) In the absence or inadequacy of the profits in any financial year, the  remuneration including the perquisities will be paid to the managerial  personnel including Managing / Whole-time Director(s) in accordance  with the applicable provisions of Schedule V of the Act, and subject  to approval of Central Government.
However, in case of payment of  remuneration to Professional Directors as provided under Section II of  Part II of Schedule V of the Act, no approval of the Central Government  shall be required subject to the compliances mentioned under the Act.
This Explanatory Statement may also be considered as the requisite  abstract under Section 190 of the Companies Act, 2013 setting out the  terms, conditions and limits of remuneration for managerial personnel.
None of the Non-Executive Directors or their relatives are concerned or  interested, financially or otherwise, in this resolution.
All the Managing and the  Whole-time Director(s) may be deemed to be concerned or interested in this  resolution to the extent it affects the overall remuneration payable to them.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS To avoid duplication between the Directors’ Report and the Management  Discussion and Analysis, we present below a composite summary of  performance of the various businesses and functions of the Company.
4.
ECONOMY AND MARKETS While the global economies continued to witness slow growth during  the current year as well, the Indian economy on a macro basis stayed  fairly robust.
The below par performance of global economy was reflected  in a continued slowdown in growth in most emerging and developing  economies, driven by weaker capital inflows and a subdued global trade.
India, however, was one of the faster growing large economies in the  world, with a currency that performed better than most other emerging  market currencies.
There was a significant upturn in commodity prices after a year of  deflation.
Consumer spending remained subdued during the early part  of the year impacted by two years of drought.
The gradual recovery of  the market was temporarily impacted by adverse liquidity conditions post  demonetisation and especially in the December quarter.
Overall, this was  a year of moderate growth rates across FMCG categories.
Given the backdrop of slow market growth, volatile input cost environment  and heightened competitive intensity, the operating environment for your  Company during the year continued to be challenging.
Your Company’s performance for the year 2016-17 has to be viewed in the  context of aforesaid economic and market environment.
5.
PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESSES AND  CATEGORIES Your Company delivered yet another year of resilient performance, aided  by healthy marketing and trade investments, exciting innovations, and  stepped up market development and sharper in-market execution.
Your  Company continued to leverage and benefit from the inputs received from  Unilever across various aspects of the business, including technology,  innovation, services and marketing mix that enabled your Company to  launch several new offerings to serve the needs of consumers.
The year began with a sharp upturn in the commodity cycle with crude  and vegetable oil prices rising significantly whilst the market continued  to remain volatile.
Your Company had proactively passed on the benefits  of lower commodity costs to the consumers when the commodity prices  were deflationary last year.
During the year, your Company had to take  calibrated price increases as commodity prices increased sharply.
To fuel growth, your Company continued to deploy effective cost savings  programmes.
These savings not only aid in deploying investments to build  brands and capabilities but also help the Company in delivering its profit  objective.
During the year, an extensive review of the business under the  ‘Zero Based Budgeting’ project was conducted and your Company has  crafted some well-considered plans to further drive operating efficiencies  in the coming years.
Your Company strives to be the supplier of choice across the distribution  channels it operates in.
During the year, your Company continued to focus  on quality of distribution in General Trade, improving in-store presence  in Modern Trade and building capabilities in e-commerce.
Your Company  continued to build upon the ‘Winning in Many Indias’ agenda to benefit  from geographical focus while leveraging scale.
Your Company also  continued to focus on magnifying innovations in the marketplace through  brilliant execution and on building markets of the future or what we call  as ‘market development’.
During the year, your Company re-organised its business under four major  categories i.e.
Home Care, Personal Care, Foods and Refreshments.
The change in the reporting structure is in compliance with the new  Indian Accounting Standards (converged IFRS Reporting).

Your Company optimised media and trade spends,  maintained competitive prices and invested in developing new segments,  to ensure sustainable growth.
The Fabric Wash business delivered strong topline growth  through premiumisation led by Surf.
In the emerging segments of  Machine Wash, Surf excel Matic and Comfort Fabric Conditioner continued  to perform well.
Your Company successfully launched Surf excel Matic  liquids during the year.
Sunlight soap, which has been protecting the  colours of the consumers’ clothes for 75 years, launched a unique  mentorship programme -‘Sunlight Banglar Guner Rang’ to preserve the  true colours of Bengal, which is its rich culture.
In Household Care, Vim continued to develop and premiumise  the category through the liquids portfolio.
The proposition of  ‘power of 100 lemons’ combined with a superior product and great  activation helped the product become more appealing and desirable  amongst consumers.
Domex brought its social mission alive by actively  driving awareness about the issue of open defecation in India through  the ‘See-Through Toilet Installation’ in Mumbai during the Global Citizen  event.
The activation provided consumers with first-hand exposure to the  Directors’ Report & MDA 22 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 difficulties and hardship associated with the practice of open defecation,  thereby driving the need for improved access to toilets.
Pureit, the world’s largest selling water purifier, continued to strengthen  its position as a responsible and purpose-driven brand.
Pureit’s mission  is to provide safe drinking water to 100 million people by 2020.
By  2016, Pureit provided over 74 billion litres of safe drinking water.
Pureit  continued to target potential consumers from the bottom of the pyramid  and partnered with Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) to provide them  access to safe drinking water through affordable instalments.
Pureit  expanded its play in the growing branded Reverse Osmosis (RO) segment  with a successful launch of Classic RO range of water purifiers.
This has  democratised the segment by providing consumers a quality range of RO  water purifiers at an affordable price.
5.2 Personal Care The strategic thrusts of Personal Care business include strengthening  the core, accelerating premiumisation, investing in developing segments  of the future and building capabilities such as digital and e-commerce  for the future.

Your Company believes  that there is substantial potential that exists in all segments within its  Personal Care business.
The mission of this business is to inspire a billion  Indians to attend better to their personal care.
The year witnessed a significant inflation in key raw material prices for the  Personal Wash Category.
Your Company took calibrated pricing actions to  offset the cost increases.
The price increases in this category impacted  the volumes.
The business witnessed muted growth in this category for  most part of the year.
With steps taken to address some issues around  Lux, Hamam and Lifebuoy soap brands, the growth trend was reversed  in the last quarter, with the category registering reasonable growth.
Lux  was supported by a big intervention, the ’Lux Golden Rose Awards’, a  buzz-creating brand engagement platform.
Your Company continued to  invest behind market development of handwash and bodywash.
Skin Care category grew well on the back of both core as well as  premium offerings.
Fair & Lovely drove consumption through a focussed  campaign based on local insights and premium offerings like BB cream.
Pond’s sustained its momentum by strengthening its proposition of  ‘Spotless Radiance’ while Lakmé continued to lead with innovations like the  ‘colour-transform’ cream.
Your Company continued to lead market  development of body lotions with Vaseline through the ‘healing power’  activation of the brand.
Your Company refreshed the portfolio play in  Facial Cleansing across Fair & Lovely, Pond’s and Lakmé.
Towards the  end of the year, your Company made a foray into the Baby Care segment,  with the launch of a range of products under the brand, ‘Baby Dove’.
Hair Care sustained its strong performance, with all brands growing  ahead of the market.
Innovations and well-crafted activations have led  to a preference for Hair Care brands with Dove, Clinic Plus, Sunsilk and  TRESemmé, all doing well.
Oral Care had a subdued performance.
Closeup was relaunched  with an improved product towards the latter part of the year and the  brand continued to build the youth-oriented campaign on making your  ‘First Move’.
Pepsodent has also been strengthened with an improved  flavour and an activation built on the insight of children craving for  sweets during festive occasions.
The Oral Care category is undergoing  a shift in its construct with ‘naturals’, ‘freshness’ and ‘care & problem  solution’ segments moving towards equal proportions in the market.
This  reshaping of the category has created new growth opportunities for your  Company, especially in the ‘naturals’ segment.
Lakmé Colors continues to drive premiumisation by upgrading users  through the long lasting ‘9 to 5’ platform, and taking the latest trends from  the runway to the consumers under the ‘Absolute’ platform.
The brand  has continued to pioneer the launch of the best makeup innovations, with  the launch of Argan Oil variant as well as Enrich Matte Lipsticks, which  have been well received.
In Deodorants, through Axe, your Company has further strengthened its  position at the premium-end with the launch of fine fragrances under the  Signature range, while building its current assortment with new variants  in the perfume sprays segment.
During the year, your Company made its foray into the fast-evolving   ‘naturals segment’ by reviving the brand LEVER Ayush and through the  acquisition of Indulekha.
LEVER Ayush was first launched in the year 2002 both  in product and services space.
LEVER Ayush has been re-launched with new  mixes in select geographies as a master brand across major categories like  Skin Cleansing, Skin Care, Hair Care and Oral Care and promises the 5,000 year  old wisdom of ayurveda for modern day beauty problems.

Your Company will continue to expand the footprint of this  brand.
Your Company also introduced ‘naturals’ variants in core brands such as  Fair & Lovely Ayurveda, Clinic Plus Ayurveda and TRESemmé Botanique, to  ensure your Company builds a comprehensive portfolio at scale in this fast  growing segment.
5.3 Foods The Foods business of your Company comprises culinary products such as  jams, ketchups and squashes under Kissan; soups, soupy noodles, meal  makers and seasonings under Knorr and staple foods comprising atta and  salt under Annapurna.
While your Company continued to grow ahead of  the markets in most categories, the overall growth of the categories and  consequently our business slowed down as compared to the previous years.
Kissan maintained its leadership across categories while increasing  penetration and reaching more households than ever before.
Both  ketchup and jam showed strong distribution increase and strengthening  of consumer preference.
The launch of three exciting new variants of  premium jams helped the brand reach new households while contributing  to the growth of the jams category.
Knorr brand had a healthy performance with the convenient instant  soups ‘single serve’ format performing particularly well.
Your Company  expanded its ‘cook up’ soup offerings with the launch of international  flavours in a ‘4 serve’ format.
This, supported by widespread sampling,  ensured that the soup category has grown in relevance as a healthy  in-between meal option.
The Knorr Meal Maker portfolio continued to be  led by in-store sampling and activations.
Your Company continued its focus on improving the profitability of the  Annapurna business by driving efficiencies across the value chain.
Your Company also scaled up its experiential marketing initiatives.
Given  the relevance of market development, it is critical that consumers sample  your Company’s products and discover the great taste and convenience  that the products offer.

Most of the brands continued to grow well and improved their brand  equity scores.
There were new products and variants launched across  categories which were received well by consumers.
The Beverages segment delivered broad based growth across both Tea  and Coffee.
The growth across key brands was driven by leveraging the  ‘Winning in Many Indias’ approach.
Brooke Bond Red Label walked the talk on its purpose of ‘making the  world a more welcoming place’ by sponsoring India’s first transgender  music band – Brooke Bond Red Label 6-Pack Band.
This initiative was  lauded as a path-breaking one and was conferred with several prestigious  national and international awards, including a Grand Prix at the Cannes  Lions Festival.

Brief outline of the Company’s CSR Policy,  including overview of projects / programmes  undertaken: Your Company has a simple but clear purpose – to make sustainable  living commonplace.
This purpose inspires your Company’s vision to  accelerate growth in the business, while reducing its environmental  footprint and increasing its positive social impact.
Your Company’s  commitment to sustainable living is not only helping to drive strong  business growth but also helping to enhance equity and preference  for its brands with consumers.
Your Company believes that in the long term, this is the best way for  business to grow sustainably.
That is why Unilever Sustainable Living  Plan (USLP) (Link - http://www.hul.co.in/sustainable-living/) is at  the heart of your Company’s business model.
The USLP has three  global goals namely: (i) help more than a billion people take action  to improve their health and well-being; (ii) halve the environmental  footprint of the making and use of products; and (iii) enhance the  livelihoods of millions of people while growing the business.
These  goals also contribute to and are covered by activities listed in the  Schedule VII of Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.
USLP  commits to a value chain approach which is integrated across your  Company’s brands and operations.
Your Company also supports  the United nation’s Sustainable Development Goals through its  initiatives.
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy of the Company, as  approved by the Board of Directors, is available on the Company’s  website at www.hul.co.in  A brief overview of your Company’s projects is given below: Improving Health and Well-being  •	 Handwashing Behaviour Change Programme: Every year, in India,  1.3 million children die before they reach the age of five, many  due to preventable infections.
Handwashing with soap has been  cited as one of the most cost-effective solutions to address this  challenge1.
A review of several studies show that the simple act of  handwashing in institutions, such as primary schools and day care  centres, reduces the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases by an average  of 30 per cent.
Lifebuoy handwashing behaviour change initiatives  of your Company, helps in promoting the benefits of handwashing  with soap at key times during the day and encouraging people to  sustain good handwashing behaviours.
Till date, your Company has  reached over 63 million people in India.
•	 Safe Drinking Water: In the developing world, 80% diseases are  water-related.
The World Health Organization states that the provision  of safe water alone will reduce diarrhoeal diseases by up to 50%.
Your  Company’s Pureit water purifiers have been working towards making  safe water accessible and affordable to millions.
Pureit’s most affordable  range of purifiers provide safe drinking water at a running cost of just  30 paisa per litre without the hassles of boiling, or need of electricity  or a continuous tap water supply.
In India, Pureit has provided over   74 billion litres of safe drinking water till date.
•	 Domex Toilet Academy (DTA): Domex Toilet Academy (DTA)  is a unique market-based entrepreneurial model launched by  your Company in 2014.
Currently operational in Bihar, the DTA  programme trains entrepreneurs and masons to help build and  maintain toilets; provides access to micro-financing and creates  demand for sanitation in low-income households.
Since its  inception, the DTA has trained more than 500 micro-entrepreneurs.
To date, over a lakh of toilets have been built, benefiting over six  lakh people.
•	 Swachh Aadat Swachh Bharat: Your Comapany’s ‘Swachh Aadat,   Swachh Bharat’ (SASB) programme is in line with Government of  India’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to promote good health and hygiene  practices.
In 2016, the programme continued to stress upon the  need to adopt three simple good habits (‘Swachh Aadat’) –  i. washing hands five times a day, ii.
using a toilet for defecation and keeping it clean, and ii.
adopting safe drinking water practices.
•  Swachhata Doot (Messenger of Cleanliness): This is a mobile-led  rural behaviour change communication model, wherein the  factory workers become agents of behaviour change in their  villages.
They share two-minute audio stories on clean habits  through their mobile phones.
They reach out to school children,  parents and community members thereby positively impacting  rural communities.
Your Company has successfully reached  over 30 lakh people since inception through this programme.
•	 Suvidha, the Community Hygiene Centre: Your Company has built  a first-of-its-kind urban water, hygiene and sanitation community  centre named ’Suvidha’ in Azad nagar, Ghatkopar, one of the  largest slums in Mumbai.
The community centre provides water,  sanitation, handwashing, shower facilities and laundry services at  significantly lower costs than market rates.
Suvidha uses circular  economy principles to reduce water use.
Fresh water is first  used for brushing teeth, bathing, handwashing and laundry.
The  waste water from these activities becomes the input for flushing  toilets.
Your Company built the Centre in 2016 with its partners,  the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Pratha Samajik  Sanstha, a community-based organisation.
The project was  devised, developed and built in close consultation with the local  community.
The community centre caters to over 1,500 people.

Reducing Environmental Impact •	 Water Conservation Projects: According to estimates, by 2030   the supply of water in India will be significantly lower than the   demand.
India has around 18% of the world’s population but only  4% of water resources are usable fresh water.
To understand and  contribute in addressing this challenge, your Company set up   Hindustan Unilever Foundation (HUF) in 2010, a not-for-profit  Company that acts as a vehicle to anchor water management demand  and supply related community development initiatives.

The ultimate objective is to gain competitive advantage by  creating a reward proposition that inspires employees to deliver Company’s  promise to consumers and achieve superior operational results.
The guiding principles for Company’s reward policies / practices are as follows: 1.
Open, Fair and Consistent: increase transparency and ensure fairness  and consistency in Reward framework.

For S. N. ANANTHASUBRAMANIAN & CO.  Company Secretaries  S. N. ANANTHASUBRAMANIAN  PARTNER  C.P No: 1774 Thane, 15th May 2017 ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION : ECONOMIC VALUE  ADDED (EVA) What is EVA?
Traditional approaches to measuring Shareholder’s Value Creation’ have  used parameters such as earnings capitalisation, market capitalisation  and present value of estimated future cash flows.
Extensive equity  research has established that it is not earnings per se, but VALUE that is  important.
A measure called ‘Economic Value Added’ (EVA) is increasingly  being applied to understand and evaluate financial performance.
*EVA = Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) - Cost of Capital  Employed (COCE), where, NOPAT = Profits after depreciation and taxes but before interest costs.
NOPAT thus represents the total pool of profits available on an ungeared  basis to provide a return to lenders and shareholders, and COCE = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) x Average Capital  Employed *Cost of debt is taken at the effective rate of interest applicable to an  “AAA” rated Company like HUL for a short term debt, net of taxes.
We have  considered a pre tax rate of 7.42% for 2016-17 (8.22% for 2015-16) *Cost of Equity is the return expected by the investors to compensate them  for the variability in returns caused by fluctuating earnings and share  prices.
Cost of Equity = Risk free return equivalent to yield on long term  Government Bonds (taken at 6.68% for 2016-17) + Market risk premium (taken at 8.69%) (x) Beta variant for the Company,  (taken at 0.710) where Beta is a relative measure of risk associated with  the Company’s shares as against the market as a whole.
Thus HUL ’s cost of equity = 6.68% + 8.69% (x) 0.710 = 12.85% What does EVA show?
EVA is residual income after charging the Company for the cost of capital  provided by lenders and shareholders.
It represents the value added to  the shareholders by generating operating profits in excess of the cost of  capital employed in the business.
When will EVA increase?
EVA will increase if: a.
Operating profits can be made to grow without employing more  capital, i.e.
greater efficiency.
b.
Additional capital’s invested in projects that return more than the cost  of obtaining new capital, I.e.
profitable growth.
c. Capital is curtailed in activities that do not cover the cost of capital, i.e  liquidate unproductive capital.
EVA in practice at Hindustan Unilever Limited.
In Hindustan Unilever Limited, the goal of sustainable long term value  creation for our shareholders is well understood by all the business  groups.
Measures to evaluate business performance and to set targets  take into account this concept of value creation.

A company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of  the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a  material effect on the financial statements.
InheRent lImItatIonS  oF  InteRnal FInancIal c ontRolS o veR  FInancIal RepoR tIng Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over  financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or  fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods  are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls over financial  reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.
opInIon In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate  internal financial control system over financial reporting and such internal  financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as  at 31 March 2017, based on the internal controls over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the essential components  of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

2 BASIS OF PREPARATION, MEASUREMENT AND SIgNIFICANT  ACCOUNTINg POLICIES  2.1  Basis of preparation and measurement (a) Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the  Indian Accounting Standards (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ind AS’) as  notified by Ministry of Corporate Affairs pursuant to section 133 of the  Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Amendment Rules, 2016.
These financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 are  the first the Company has prepared under Ind AS.
For all periods upto  and including the year ended 31st March, 2016 , the Company prepared  its financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards  notified under the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together  with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (hereinafter  referred to as ‘Previous GAAP’) used for its statutory reporting requirement  in India immediately before adopting Ind AS.
The financial statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2016 and the opening Balance Sheet  as at 1st April, 2015 have been restated in accordance with Ind AS for  comparative information.
Reconciliations and explanations of the effect  of the transition from Previous GAAP to Ind AS on the Company’s Balance  Sheet, Statement of Profit and Loss and Statement of Cash Flows are  provided in note 3.
The financial statements have been prepared on accrual and going  concern basis.
The accounting policies are applied consistently to all the  periods presented in the financial statements, including the preparation  of the opening Ind AS Balance Sheet as at 1st April, 2015 being the ‘date  of transition to Ind AS’.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as  current or non current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and  other criteria as set out in the Division II of Schedule III to the Companies  Act, 2013.
Based on the nature of products and the time between  acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and  cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12  months for the purpose of current or non-current classification of assets  and liabilities.
Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off norm  adopted by the Company have been reflected as “0” in the relevant notes in  these financial statements.
The financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31st March,  2017 were approved for issue in accordance with the resolution of the  Board of Directors on 17th May, 2017.
(b) Basis of measurement These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost  convention unless otherwise indicated.
2.2  KEY ACCOUNTINg ESTIMATES AND JUDgEMENTS The preparation of financial statements requires management to make  judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting  policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Continuous  evaluation is done on the estimation and judgments based on historical  experience and other factors, including expectations of future events  that are believed to be reasonable.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised prospectively.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies, as  well as estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect to  the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  are included in the following notes: (a) Measurement of defined benefit obligations - Note 41 (b) Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions and  contingencies - Note 21 and 25 (c) Recognition of deferred tax assets - Note 10 (d) Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projections - Note 43 (e) Measurement of consideration and assets acquired as part of  business combination - Note 43 (f) Impairment of Intangibles - Note 5 2.3  RECENT ACCOUNTINg DEVELOPMENTS Standards issued but not yet effective: In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying amendments to  Ind AS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’ and Ind AS 102, ‘Share-based payment.’  The amendments are applicable to the Company from April 1, 2017.
Amendment to Ind AS 7:  The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures  that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities  arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash  flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation  between the opening and closing balances in the balance sheet for liabilities  arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement.
The  effect on the financial statements is being evaluated by the Company.
Amendment to Ind AS 102: The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance to measurement  of cash-settled awards, modification of cash-settled awards and awards  that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes.
It clarifies that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on a  basis consistent with that used for equity settled awards.
Market-based  performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are reflected in the  ‘fair values’, but non-market performance conditions and service vesting  conditions are reflected in the estimate of the number of awards expected  to vest.
Also, the amendment clarifies that if the terms and conditions of  a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified with the  result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction,  the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modification.
Further, the amendment requires the award that include a net settlement  feature in respect of withholding taxes to be treated as equity-settled in its  entirety.
The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part  of an equity settlement.
The effect on the financial statements is being  evaluated by the Company.
Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) 2.4  SIgNIFICANT ACCOUNTINg POLICIES (a)  Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition cost net of  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if  any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or  recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the  Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other  repairs and maintenance are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss  during the period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising on retirement or disposal of property, plant and  equipment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use as  on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight line method  based on estimated useful life prescribed under Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 with the exception of the following: •	 plant	 and	equipment	is	depreciated	over	3	to	21	years	based	on	the	 technical evaluation of useful life done by the management.
•	 assets	 costing	` 5,000 or less are fully depreciated in the year of  purchase.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of property,  plant and equipment is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.
Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure  all its property, plant and equipment at the Previous GAAP carrying  amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1st  April,2015.
(b)  Intangible Assets: Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at  fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequently, intangible assets are  carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses, if any.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or  indefinite.
Finite-life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line  basis over the period of their expected useful lives.
Estimated useful lives  by major class of finite-life intangible assets are as follows: Design - 10 years Know-how - 10 years Computer software - 5 years The amortisation period and the amortisation method for finite-life  intangible assets is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.
Indefinite life intangibles mainly consist of brands/trademarks.
The  assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether  the indefinite life continues, if not, it is impaired or changed prospectively  basis revised estimates.
Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business  combinations [refer note 2.4.(q)].
These assets are not amortised but are  tested for impairment annually.
Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure  its intangible assets at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed  cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1st April,2015.
(c)  Investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture: Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less  accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Where an indication of impairment  exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written  down immediately to its recoverable amount.
On disposal of investments  in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognized in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.
Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure  its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP  carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e.,  1st April,2015.
(d)  Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is  computed on a weighted average basis.
Cost of finished goods and work- in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion costs and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and  condition.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the  ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(e)  Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents are short-term (three months or less from the  date of acquisition), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(f)  Assets held for Sale: Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities  are classified as ‘held for sale’ when all of the following criteria’s are  met: (i) decision has been made to sell.
(ii) the assets are available for  immediate sale in its present condition.
(iii) the assets are being actively  marketed and (iv) sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded  within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at the lower of its carrying value and fair value  less costs to sell.
Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or  amortised.
(g)  Financial Instruments: Financial Assets: Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instrument.
On initial recognition, a financial asset is recognised at fair value, in case of  Financial assets which are recognised at fair value through profit and loss  (FVTPL), its transaction cost are recognised in the statement of profit and  loss.
In other cases, the transaction cost are attributed to the acquisition  value of the financial asset.
Financial assets are subsequently classified as measured at •	 amortised	cost •	 fair	value	through	profit	and	loss	(FVTPL) •	 fair	value	through	other	comprehensive	income	(FVOCI).
82 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Standalone Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their recognition,  except if and in the period the Company changes its business model for  managing financial assets.
Trade Receivables and Loans: Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
Subsequently,  these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate  (EIR) method net of any expected credit losses.
The EIR is the rate that  discounts estimated future cash income through the expected life of  financial instrument.
Debt Instruments:  Debt instruments are initially measured at amortised cost, fair value  through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit  or loss (‘FVTPL ’) till derecognition on the basis of (i) the entity’s business  model for managing the financial assets and (ii) the contractual cash flow  characteristics of the financial asset.
(a) Measured at amortised cost: Financial assets that are held within a  business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to  collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal  and interest, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest rate (‘EIR’) method less impairment, if any.
The amortisation of EIR and loss arising from impairment, if any is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(b) Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income:  Financial assets that are held within a business model whose  objective is achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting  contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest, are subsequently measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income.
Fair value movements are recognized in the  other comprehensive income (OCI).
Interest income measured using  the EIR method and impairment losses, if any are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
On derecognition, cumulative gain or  loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to  ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(c) Measured at fair value through profit or loss: A financial asset not  classified as either amortised cost or FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.
Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes  in fair value, including interest income and dividend income if any,  recognised as ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Equity Instruments:  All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets are  initially measured at fair value , the Company may, on initial recognition,  irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or FVTPL.
The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Fair value changes on an equity instrument is recognised as other income  in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected  to measure such instrument at FVOCI.
Fair value changes excluding  dividends, on an equity instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised  in OCI.
Amounts recognised in OCI are not subsequently reclassified to  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Dividend income on the investments in  equity instruments are recognised as ‘other income’ in the Statement of  Profit and Loss.
Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the  contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset.
Impairment of Financial Asset Expected credit losses are recognized for all financial assets subsequent  to initial recognition other than financials assets in FVTPL category.
For financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the  Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated  or acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the  financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial recognition.
The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses  if the credit risk on financial asset increases significantly since its initial  recognition.
The Companys trade receivables do not contain significant  financing component and loss allowance on trade receivables is measured  at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e.
expected cash shortfall.
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Financial Liabilities: Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party  to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are  initially measured at the amortised cost unless at initial recognition,  they are classified as fair value through profit and loss.
In case of trade  payables, they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently, these  liabilities are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Subsequent measurement Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the EIR method.
Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or  loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the  contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(h)  Provisions and Contingent Liabilities: Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation  (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an  outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure  required to settle the present obligation at the Balance Sheet date.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are  discounted to reflect its present value using a current pre-tax rate that  reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and  the risks specific to the obligation.
When discounting is used, the increase  in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that  arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of  the amount cannot be made.
(i)  Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks  and rewards of ownership in the goods are transferred to the buyer as per  the terms of the contract, there is no continuing managerial involvement  83 Annual Report 2016-17 Hindustan Unilever Limited Reports Financial StatementsOverview Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The  Company retains no effective control of the goods transferred to a degree  usually associated with ownership and no significant uncertainty exists  regarding the amount of the consideration that will be derived from the sale  of goods.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received  or receivable, after deduction of any trade discounts, volume rebates and  any taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government which are levied  on sales such as sales tax, value added tax, etc.
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and premium on sale  of import licenses, and lease license fee are recognised on accrual basis.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on agreements/ arrangements with the customers as the service is performed in proportion  to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date and the  amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to receive  dividend is established.
(j)  Expenditure:  Expenses are accounted on accrual basis.
(k)  Employee Benefits: Defined contribution plans  Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employees’ state  insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation scheme, employee  pension scheme etc.
are charged as an expense based on the amount of  contribution required to be made as and when services are rendered by the  employees.
Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain  employees, is made to a government administered fund and charged  as an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The above benefits  are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Company has no  further defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
Defined benefit plans In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are made  to a trust administered by the Company.
The interest rate payable to the  members of the trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest  declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident  Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall  be made good by the Company.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of  interest earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Company also provides for retirement/post-retirement  benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect of certain employees),  compensated absences (in respect of certain employees) and medical  benefits including to the employees of Indian subsidiaries and a subsidiary  of parent Company.
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised as ‘Employee benefit  expenses’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss is the cost of accruing  employee benefits promised to employees over the year and the costs  of individual events such as past/future service benefit changes and  settlements (such events are recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit and Loss).
The amount of net interest expense calculated by applying  the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset is  charged or credited to ‘Finance costs’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Any differences between the interest income on plan assets and the return  actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to  changes in actuarial assumptions or experience adjustments within the  plans, are recognised immediately in ‘Other comprehensive income’ and  subsequently not reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the Balance Sheet comprises  the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present  value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate by reference  to market yields on government bonds at the end of the reporting period).
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined based on valuations, as  at the Balance Sheet date, made by independent actuary using the projected  unit credit method.
The classification of the Company’s net obligation into  current and non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement benefits or  termination benefits arising from restructuring, are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company recognises termination  benefits at the earlier of the following dates:  (a) when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those  benefits; or  (b) when the Company recognises costs for a restructuring that is within  the scope of Ind AS 37 and involves the payment of termination  benefits.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting  period are discounted to their present value Share-Based Payments: Employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of share- based payments in consideration of the services rendered.
Under the equity settled share based payment, the fair value on the  grant date of the awards given to employees is recognised as ‘employee  benefit expenses’ with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting  period.
The fair value of the options at the grant date is calculated by  an independant valuer basis Black Scholes model.
At the end of each  reporting period, apart from the non market vesting condition, the expense  is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of options expected  to vest.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues fresh equity  shares.
For cash-settled share based payments, the fair value of the amount  payable to employees is recognised as ‘employee benefit expenses’ with a  corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period of non market vesting  conditions getting fulfilled.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting  period up to, and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value  recognised in employee benefits expenses.
Refer Note 42 for details.
(l)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets: Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date as to  whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired.
Indefinite life intangibles are subject to a review for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is necessary.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable  group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of  assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
Goodwill acquired in a  business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of  the Company’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from  the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or  liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable  amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
Asset/cash  generating unit whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount  are written down to the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment  84 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Standalone Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The impairment  loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if any)  allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit,  pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Recoverable  amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less  cost of disposal and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of  estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an  asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful  life.
Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether  there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in  prior accounting periods may no longer exist or may have decreased, basis  the assessment a reversal of an impairment loss for an asset other than  goodwill is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss account.
(m) Income Taxes: Income tax expense for the year comprises of current tax and deferred tax.
It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent  it relates to a business combination or to an item which is recognised  directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable/receivable on the taxable income/ loss for the year using applicable tax rates at the Balance Sheet date, and  any adjustment to taxes in respect of previous years.
Interest income/ expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in  current tax expense.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the  carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax liability is recognised based on the expected manner of  realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities,  using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the  reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that  it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the  asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting  date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related  tax benefit will be realised.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a  legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is  an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.
Deferred  tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally  enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities;  and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income  taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
(n) Leases: Leases in which a substantial portion of the risks and rewards of ownership  are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments and  receipts under such leases are recognised to the Statement of Profit and  Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the lease  payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected  general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost  increases, in which case the same are recognised as an expense in line  with the contractual term.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer  substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee.
(o)  Foreign Currencies: The financial statements are presented in INR, the functional currency of  the Company.
Items included in the financial statements of the Company  are recorded using the currency of the primary economic environment in  which the Company operates (the ‘functional currency’).
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency  using exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains  and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of  monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date exchange rates are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(p)  Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the period  attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted  average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.
The weighted  average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and for all  periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity  shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for  the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average  number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(q)  Business Combination: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting  method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control  is transferred to the Company.
The consideration transferred in the  acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  are recognised at fair values on their acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially  measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration  transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and  any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities assumed.
The Company recognises any non-controlling interest  in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at  fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the  acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.
Consideration transferred does  not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, other than those incurred  in relation to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent  consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to first time adoption, the  Company has elected to apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations  prospectively from 1st April 2015.
As such, Previous GAAP balances relating  to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill,  have been carried forward as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
3.
FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS The Company has adopted Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as notified  by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs with effect from 1st April, 2016, with a  transition date of 1st April, 2015.
These financial statements for the year  ended 31st March, 2017 are the first financial statements the Company  has prepared under Ind AS.
For all periods upto and including the year  ended 31st March, 2016 , the Company prepared its financial statements  in accordance with the accounting standards notified under the section  133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the  Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (‘Previous GAAP’).
The adoption of Ind AS has been carried out in accordance with Ind AS 101,  First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) consistently for all financial years presented.
Accordingly, the Company  has prepared financial statements which comply with Ind AS for year  ended 31st March, 2017, together with the comparative information as at  and for the year ended 31st March, 2016 and the opening Ind AS Balance  Sheet as at 1st April, 2015, the date of transition to Ind AS.
In preparing these Ind AS financial statements, the Company has availed  certain exemptions and exceptions in accordance with Ind AS 101, as  explained below.
The resulting difference between the carrying values of  the assets and liabilities in the financial statements as at the transition  date under Ind AS and Previous GAAP have been recognised directly in  equity (retained earnings or another appropriate category of equity).
This  note explains the adjustments made by the Company in restating its  financial statements prepared under previous GAAP, including the Balance  Sheet as at 1st April, 2015 and the financial statements as at and for the  year ended 31st March, 2016.
A.
Optional Exemptions from retrospective application Ind AS 101 permits first-time adopters certain exemptions from  retrospective application of certain requirements under Ind AS.
The  Company has elected to apply the following optional exemptions from  retrospective application: (i) Business combinations Ind AS 103 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of  subsidiaries, or of interests in associates and joint ventures and transactions  which are considered businesses for Ind AS, that occurred before 1st  April, 2015.
The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in accordance  with Previous GAAP are considered as their deemed cost at the date of  acquisition.
After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance  with Ind AS.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the opening Ind AS Balance  Sheet is its carrying amount in accordance with the Previous GAAP.
(ii)  Deemed cost for property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets The Company has elected to measure all its property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed  cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.

However, estimates that were required under Ind  AS but not required under Previous GAAP are made by the Company for  the relevant reporting dates reflecting conditions existing as at that date.
(ii) Classification and measurement of financial assets The classification of financial assets to be measured at amortised cost or  fair value through other comprehensive income is made on the basis of the  facts and circumstances that existed on the date of transition to Ind AS.

Adjustments to Statement of Cash flows There were no material differences between the Statement of Cash Flows presented under Ind AS and the Previous GAAP.
Notes to the Reconciliations (a) Investment in Controlled Trust Under Previous GAAP, the investment in the Hindustan Unilever Limited Securitisation of Retirement Benefit Trust (‘HURB Trust’) did not qualify as  plan asset under AS 15 and accordingly presented as non-current investment.
Under Ind AS, the HURB Trust qualifies as a plan asset.
Accordingly, the  plan asset has been fair valued as per actuarial valuation carried in accordance with Ind AS on date of transition to Ind AS and as at each balance sheet  date.
The plan asset recognised has been netted off against provision for employee benefits.
The interest income and remeasurement gain/(loss) on the  recognised plan asset has been recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income respectively.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Asset:  Investments (Non-current)  (350)  (350)  -  Liability:  Provisions (Non-current)  347  339  -   Provisions (Current)  6  7  -  Equity:  Other equity (Retained earnings)  (3)  4  -  (Profit)/Loss:  Finance cost  -  -  (5)  Remeasurement (gain)/loss on net defined benefit plans  -  -  13  (b) Current Investments i.
Investments in treasury bills and government securities - Under Previous GAAP, the investments in treasury bills and government securities were  measured at cost or market value, whichever is lower.
Under Ind AS, the Company has designated these investments as fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVOCI).
Accordingly, these investments are required to be measured at fair value.
At the date of transition to Ind AS, difference  between the fair value of the investments and carrying value under previous GAAP has been recognised in Other equity (Retained earnings for interest  income component and Debt instruments through Other Comprehensive Income for fair value change).
Interest income and fair value changes are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income respectively for the year ended 31st March, 2016. ii.
Mutual funds - Under Previous GAAP, the mutual funds were measured at cost or market value, whichever is lower.
Under Ind AS, the Company has  designated these investments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Accordingly, these investments are required to be measured at fair value.
At  the date of transition to Ind AS, difference between the fair value of the instruments and the carrying value under Previous GAAP has been recognised  in retained earnings.
Fair value changes are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended 31st March, 2016.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) (c) Derivative Instruments - Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Under Previous GAAP, unrealised net loss on foreign exchange forward contracts, if any, as at each Balance Sheet date was provided for.
Under Ind  AS, foreign exchange forward contracts are mark-to-market as at Balance Sheet date and unrealised net gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss  statement.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are presented on gross basis.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Asset:  Other financial assets (Current)  1  3  -  Liability:  Other financial liabilities (Current)  (1)  (3)  -  (d) Proposed Dividend Under Previous GAAP, proposed dividends and related dividend distribution tax was recognised as a provision in the year to which they relate, irrespective  of when they are declared.
Under Ind AS, dividends and related dividend distribution tax are recognised as a liability in the year in which it is approved by  the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Equity:  Other equity (Retained earnings)  (2,344)  (2,474)  -  Liability:  Provisions (Current)  2,344  2,474  -  (e) Other Non-Current Liabilities Under Previous GAAP, non-current liabilities were recognised on undiscounted basis.
Ind AS requires such liabilities to be recognised at present value  (discounted value) where the effect of time value of money is material.
This led to a decrease in the value of non-current liabilities on the date of transition  which was adjusted against retained earnings.
Ind AS also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying amount of the liability increases in each  period to reflect the passage of time.
This increase is recognised as finance cost.
The interest cost on unwinding of discount and impact of change in  discount rate are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss under ‘Finance costs’ and ‘employee benefit expenses’ respectively for the year ended  31st March, 2016.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Equity:  Other equity (Retained earnings)  (19)  (17)  -  Liability:  Other non-current liabilities  19  17  -  (Profit)/Loss:  Employee benefits expenses  -  -  0   Finance costs  -  -  2  91 Annual Report 2016-17 Hindustan Unilever Limited Reports Financial StatementsOverview Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) (f) Employee Stock Option Plan Under Previous GAAP, the intrinsic value of the employee stock option plan was recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
Under Ind AS, the  compensation cost of employee stock option plan is recognised based on the fair value of the options determined using an appropriate pricing model  at the date of grant.
The reduction in employee compensation cost for the unvested options as on the date of transition based on fair value method has  been adjusted against retained earnings.
The impact for the year ended 31st March, 2016 has been recognised in ‘Employee benefits expenses’ in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Equity:  Other equity (Securities Premium Reserve)  -  1  -   Other equity (Employee Stock Options Outstanding Account)  2  1  -   Other equity (Retained earnings)  (2)  (2)  -  (Profit)/Loss:  Employee benefits expenses  -  -  (0) (g) Deferred Taxes Under Previous GAAP, deferred taxes were recognised for the tax effect of timing differences between accounting profit and taxable profit for the year  using the income statement approach.
Under Ind AS, deferred taxes are recognised using the balance sheet for future tax consequences of temporary  differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
The above difference, together with the consequential  tax impact of the other Ind AS transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences.
Deferred tax adjustments are recognised in correlation to the  underlying transaction either in retained earnings or through other comprehensive income.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 Asset:  Deferred tax assets (net)  (41)  (64) Equity:  Other equity (Retained earnings)  40  64   Other equity (Debt instruments through Other Comprehensive Income)  1  0  (Profit)/Loss:  Deferred tax (credit)/charge  28   Income tax relating to Remeasurement (gain)/loss on net defined benefit plans  (5)  (Gain)/loss on debt instruments through other comprehensive income  (1) 92 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Standalone Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) (h) Excise Duty Under Previous GAAP, excise duty was netted off against sale of goods.
However, under Ind AS, excise duty is included in sale of goods and is separately  presented as expense on the face of Statement of Profit and Loss.
Thus, sale of goods under Ind AS has increased with a corresponding increase in  expenses.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 (Profit)/Loss:  Revenue from operations  -  -  (2,430)  Excise duty  -  -  2,430  (i) Revenue from Sale of goods Under Previous GAAP, revenue was recognised net of trade discounts, rebates, sales taxes and excise duties.
Under Ind AS, revenue is recognised at the  fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deduction of any trade discounts, volume rebates and any taxes or duties collected on behalf  of the government such as sales tax and value added tax except excise duty.
Discounts given include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to  customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs which have been reclassified from ‘advertising and sales promotion’ within other  expenses under Previous GAAP and netted from revenue under Ind AS.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 (Profit)/Loss:  Revenue from operations  -  -  926   Other expenses  -  -  (926) (j) Interest on Income Tax Refund Under Previous GAAP, the interest on income tax refund was recognised as ‘other income’.
Under Ind AS, the Company has adopted the accounting  policy to recognise interest income/expense related to income tax as part of income tax expense.
Accordingly, the interest on income tax refund has been  reclassified from ‘other income’ to ‘tax expenses - current tax’ for the year ended 31st March, 2016.
Debit / (Credit) Debit / (Credit) Balance Sheet Statement of   profit and loss As at  1st April, 2015 As at  31st March, 2016 Year ended  31st March, 2016 (Profit)/Loss:  Other income  -  -  7   Tax expenses - current tax  -  -  (7) (k) Non-Current Provisions Under Previous GAAP, non-current provisions were recognised on undiscounted basis.
Ind AS requires such provisions to be recognised at present value  (discounted value) where the effect of time value of money is material.
This led to a decrease in the value of non-current provisions for the year ended  31st March,2016 which was recognised in ‘Exceptional items’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss where the underlying provision was initially recognised.
Subsequently, the present value is increased to reflect passage of time by recognising finance cost.

ii.
Net interest cost on defined benefit plans - Under Previous GAAP, the interest cost on defined benefit liability and expected return on plan assets  was recognised as employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Under Ind AS, the Company has recognised the net interest cost  on defined benefit plans as finance cost.

Following key assumptions were considered while performing Impairment testing Long term sustainable growth rates 7% Weighted Average Cost of Capital % (WACC) befor tax (Discount rate) 13% Average segmental margins 24% The projections cover a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances  before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance are based on the  conservative estimates from past performance.
Segmental margins are based on FY 2016-17 performance.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital % (WACC) = Risk free return + ( Market risk premium x Beta variant for the Company).
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause  the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than the carrying value.

FAIR VALUE hIERARChY The fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note (A) above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the  valuation technique.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)  and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows:  	 •	 Level	1:	Quoted	prices	for	identical	instruments	in	an	active	market; 	 •	 Level	2:	Directly	or	indirectly	observable	market	inputs,	other	than	Level	1	inputs;	and 	 •	 Level	3:	Inputs	which	are	not	based	on	observable	market	data.
For assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date, the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarized  below: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total As at 31st March, 2017 Assets at fair value Investments measured at: i.

CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent  with those used for the year ended 31st March, 2016.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance Sheet date:  1.
The fair values of investment in treasury bills, government securities and quoted investment in equity shares is based on the current bid price of  respective investment as at the Balance Sheet date.
2.
The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in  the published statements as at Balance Sheet date.
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the  price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.
3.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The  models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties and foreign exchange forward rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities  -  Cash and cash equivalents (except for investments in mutual funds), trade receivables, investments in term deposits, other financial assets  (except derivative financial instruments), trade payables, and other financial liabilities (except derivative financial instruments) have fair values  that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
-  Loans have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts as it is based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows  using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
SIgNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUES As at 31st March, 2017 Significant unobservable inputs Sensitivity of input to fair value measurement Contingent consideration Forecast revenue: 10% increase in forecasted revenue will have  additional liability of ` 5 crores and 10% decrease  will have  an equal but opposite effect.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) 40 FINANCIAL RISK MANA gEMENT The Company’s business activities are exposed  to a variety of financial risks, namely liquidity risk, market risks and credit risk.
The Company’s senior  management has the overall responsibility for establishing and governing the Company’s risk management framework.
The Company has constituted  a Risk Management Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company’s risk management policies.
The Company’s risk  management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set and monitor appropriate risk limits and controls,  periodically review the changes in market conditions and reflect the changes in the policy accordingly.
The key risks and mitigating actions are also  placed before the Audit Committee of the Company.
A. MANA gEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Company’s approach in managing  liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management  considers both normal and stressed conditions.
The Company maintained a cautious liquidity strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout the year ended 31st March, 2017 and 31st March, 2016.
Cash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Company regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure it has sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet operational needs.
Any short term  surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash  and cash equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and other highly marketable debt investments  with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring  sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows along with  its carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
Undiscounted Amount Carrying amount Payable within 1 year More than 1 years Total  As at 31st March, 2017 Non-derivative liabilities Trade payables (including acceptances)  6,006  6,006 -  6,006  Security deposits  22 -  22  22  Unpaid dividend  114  114 -  114  Other Payables  54  54 -  54  Contingent consideration  49  -    73  73  Derivative liabilities Forward exchange contracts  13  13 -  13  As at 31st March, 2016 Non-derivative liabilities Trade payables (including acceptances)  5,498  5,498 -  5,498  Security deposits  19 -  19  19  Unpaid dividend  104  104 -  104  Other Payables  123  123 -  123  Derivative liabilities Foreign exchange forward contracts  10  10 -  10  As at 1st April, 2015 Non-derivative liabilities Trade payables (including acceptances)  5,252  5,252 -  5,252  Security deposits  18 -  18  18  Unpaid dividend  92  92 -  92  Other Payables  77  77 -  77  Derivative liabilities Foreign exchange forward contracts  38  38 -  38 120 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Standalone Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) B. MANA gEMENT OF MARKET RISK           The Company’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: 	 •	 currency	risk;	 	 •	 price	risk;		and 	 •	 interest	rate	risk The above risks may affect the Company’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The Company’s exposure to and management  of these risks are explained below.
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF RISK MANA gEMENT POLICY SENSITIVITY TO RISK 1.
CURRENCY RISK The Company is subject to the risk that changes  in foreign currency values impact the Company’s  exports revenue and imports of raw material and  property, plant and equipment.
As at 31st March, 2017, the net unhedged  exposure to the Company on holding financial  assets (trade receivables and capital advances)  and liabilities (trade payables and capital  creditors) other than in their functional currency  amounted to ` 2 crores payable (31st March,  2016: ` 3 crores and 1st April, 2015: `   4 crores).
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange  risk arising from various currency exposures,  primarily with respect to US Dollar and Euro.
The Company manages currency exposures  within prescribed limits, through use of  forward exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange  transactions are covered with strict limits  placed on the amount of uncovered exposure, if  any, at any point in time.
The aim of the Company’s approach to   management of currency risk is to leave the  Company with no material residual risk.
A 5% strengthening of the INR against key  currencies to which the Company is exposed  (net of hedge) would have led to approximately  an additional ` 0 crores gain in the Statement of  Profit and Loss (2015-16: ` 0 crores gain).
A 5%  weakening of the INR against these currencies  would have led to an equal but opposite effect.
2.
PRICE RISK The Company is mainly exposed to the price risk due  to its investment in debt mutual funds.
The price risk  arises due to uncertainties about the future market  values of these investments.
At 31st March 2017, the investments in debt mutual  funds amounts to `  2,060 crores (31st March, 2016:   ` 1,196 crores and 1st April, 2015: ` 925 crores).
These are exposed to price risk.
The Company has laid  policies and guidelines  which it adheres to in order to minimise price risk   arising from investments in debt mutual funds.
A 1% increase in prices would have led to  approximately an additional ` 21 crores gain in  the Statement of Profit and Loss (2015-16: ` 12  crores gain).
A 1% decrease in prices would have  led to an equal but opposite effect.
3.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is mainly exposed to the interest  rate risk due to its investment in treasury bills  and government securities.
The interest rate  risk arises due to uncertainties about the future  market interest rate on these investments.
The Company has laid  policies and guidelines  including  tenure of investment made to  minimise impact of interest rate risk.
A 0.25% decrease in interest rates would have led  to approximately an additional ` 1 crore gain in the  Statement of Profit and Loss (2015-16: ` 1 crore  gain).
A 0.25% decrease in interest rates would have  led to an equal but opposite effect.
In addition to treasury bills and government  securities, the Company invests in term deposits  for a period of less than one year.
Considering the  short-term nature, there is no significant interest  rate risk pertaining to these deposits.
As at 31st March 2017, the investments in  treasury bill and government securities  amounts to ` 1,459 (31st March, 2016: ` 1,265  crores and 1st April, 2015: ` 1,946 crores).
These  are exposed to interest rate risk.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) C. MANA gEMENT OF CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Trade receivables Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Company’s customer base being large and diverse.
All trade  receivables are reviewed and assessed for default on a quarterly basis.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables is that credit risk is low.
Hence, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets.
Refer note 2.4(g) for accounting policy on Financial Instruments.
Other financial assets The Company maintains exposure in cash and cash equivalents, term deposits with banks, investments in treasury bills, government securities, money  market liquid mutual funds and derivative instrument with financial institutions.
The Company has set counter-parties  limits  based on multiple factors  including financial position, credit rating, etc.
The Company has given inter-corporate deposits (ICD) only to its subsidiaries amounting ` 198 crores (31st  March, 2016: ` 162 crores and 1st April, 2015: ` 180 crores).
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31st March, 2017, 2016 and 1st April, 2015 is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.
41 DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Refer note 2.4(k) for accounting policy on Employee Benefits.
Description of Plans Retirement Benefit Plans of the Company include Gratuity, Management Pension, Officer’s Pension and Provident Fund.
Other Post-Employment Benefit  Plans includes Post-Retirement Medical Benefits.
Gratuity is funded through investments mostly with an insurance service provider and partly through direct investment under Hind Lever Gratuity Fund.
Pension (Management Pension and Officer’s Pension) for most employees is managed through a trust, investments with an insurance service provider  and for some employees investments are managed through Company managed trust.
Provident Fund for most of the employees are managed through  trust investments and for some employees through government administered fund.
Post-retirement medical benefits are managed through investment  made under Company managed trust.
governance  The trustees of the trust fund are responsible for the overall governance of the plan and to act in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and  rules in the best interests of the plan participants.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund and play a role in the long-term  investment, risk management and funding strategy.
Investment Strategy The Company’s investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the applicable statutory requirements.
The  plans expose the Company to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and inflation risk.
The Company  has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance  between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Company of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified,  such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
During the year the Company has amended its discreationary increase clause with respect to post retirement benefit plan, which has resulted into  `115  crores credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

136 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Consolidated RepoRt on the inteRnal FinanCial ContR ols undeR  Clause  (i) oF sub-seCtion 3 oF  seCtion 143 oF  the Companies aC t, 2013  (“the aCt”) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial  statements of Hindustan Unilever Limited (“the Holding Company”) as  of and for the year ended 31 March 2017, we have audited the internal  financial controls over financial reporting of the Holding Company and its  subsidiary companies incorporated in India as of that date.
management’s Responsibility FoR inteRnal FinanCial ContRols The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary  companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal controls  over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company and  its subsidiary companies incorporated in India considering the essential  components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”)  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).
These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the  prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).
auditoR’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s, and  its subsidiary companies incorporated in India, internal financial controls  over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in  accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the Standards  on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section  143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls, both issued by the ICAI.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal  financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained  and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about  the adequacy of the internal financial control system over financial  reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial  controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that  a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind  AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Holding  Company’s and its subsidiary companies incorporated in India, internal  financial control system over financial reporting.
meaning oF  inteRnal FinanCial ContR ols o veR FinanCial  RepoRting A company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting is a process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s  internal financial controls over financial reporting includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the  assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with  authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of  unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements.
inheRent limitations oF  inteRnal FinanCial ContR ols o veR  FinanCial RepoR ting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over  financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or  fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of  the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are  subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting  may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the  degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies  incorporated in India, have in all material respects, an adequate internal  financial control system over financial reporting and such internal  financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as  at 31 March 2017, based on the internal controls over financial reporting  criteria established by the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies,  considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the  Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

The Group holds investments in the below entities which by share ownership are deemed to be an associate company: i)  Comfund Consulting Limited where the Group has 24% equity holding.
This is a Non Banking Finance Company (NBFC) set up between HUL and a  partner company, currently dormant.

ii) The Group does not participate in policy making process.
iii) The Group does not have any material transactions with the investee.
iv) The Group does not interchange any managerial personnel.

These Consolidated Financial statements for the year ended 31st March,  2017 are the first the Group has prepared under Ind AS.
For all periods  upto and including the year ended 31st March, 2016 , the Group prepared  its Consolidated Financial statements in accordance with the accounting  standards notified under the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013,  read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014  (hereinafter referred to as ‘Previous GAAP’) used for its statutory reporting  requirement in India immediately before adopting Ind AS.
The Consolidated  Financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2016 and the opening  Balance Sheet as at 1st April, 2015 have been restated in accordance with  Ind AS for comparative information.
Reconciliations and explanations of the  effect of the transition from Previous GAAP to Ind AS on the Company’s  Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit and Loss and Statement of Cash Flows  are provided in note 3.
The Consolidated Financial statements have been prepared on accrual and  going concern basis.
The accounting policies are applied consistently to all  the periods presented in the Consolidated Financial statements, including  the preparation of the opening Ind AS  Balance Sheet as at 1st April,  2015 being the ‘date of transition to Ind AS’.
All assets and liabilities have  been classified as current or non current as per the Company’s normal  operating cycle and other criteria as set out in the Division II of Schedule  III to the Companies Act, 2013.
Based on the nature of products and the  time between acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in  cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle  as 12 months for the purpose of current or non-current classification of  assets and liabilities.
Subsidiaries are entities where the group exercise or controls more than  one-half of its total share capital.
The net assets and results of acquired  businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from  their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group  obtains control.
The results of disposed businesses are included in the  consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the  date control ceases.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform  accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar  circumstances.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of  financial statements are consistent with those of previous year.
The  financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been  combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of  like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, after eliminating  intra-group balances, intra-group transactions and the unrealised profits/ losses, unless cost/revenue cannot be recovered.
The excess of cost to the Group of its investment in subsidiaries, on the  acquisition dates over and above the Group’s share of equity in the subsidiaries,  is recognised as ‘Goodwill on Consolidation’ being an asset in the consolidated  financial statements.
The said Goodwill is not amortised, however, it is tested  for impairment at each Balance Sheet date and the impairment loss, if any, is  provided for.
On the other hand, where the share of equity in subsidiaries as  on the date of investment is in excess of cost of investments of the Group, it  is recognised as ‘Capital Reserve’ and shown under the head ‘Reserves and  Surplus’ in the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries  is identified and presented in the consolidated Balance Sheet separately  within equity.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries  consists of: (a)  The amount of equity attributable to non-controlling interests at the  date on which investment in a subsidiary is made; and  (b)  The non-controlling interests share of movements in equity since the  date parent subsidiary relationship came into existence.
The profit and other comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling  interests of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Statement of Profit  and Loss and Statement of Changes in Equity.
Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off norm  adopted by the Group have been reflected as “0” in the relevant notes in  these Consolidated Financial statements.
The Consolidated Financial statements of the Company for the year ended  31st March, 2017 were approved for issue in accordance with the resolution  of the Board of Directors on 17th May, 2017.
(b) Basis of measurement These Consolidated Financial statements are prepared under the historical  cost convention unless otherwise indicated.
2.2 KeY a CC oUnting estiMates and JUdgeMents The preparation of Consolidated Financial statements requires  management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the  application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of  assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from  these estimates.
Continuous evaluation is done on the estimation and  judgments  based on historical experience and other factors, including  expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
Revisions  to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies, as  well as estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect to  the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  are included in the following notes: (a) Measurement of defined benefit obligations - Note 43 (b) Measurement and likelihood of occurrence of provisions and  contingencies - Note 21 and 26 (c) Recognition of deferred tax assets  - Note 9 (d) Key assumptions used in discounted cash flow projections - Note 46 (e) Measurement of consideration and assets acquired as part of  business combination - Note 46 (f) Impairment of Intangible - Note 5  148 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Consolidated Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) 2.3  ReCent a CC oUnting deVeloPMents  standards issued but not yet effective: In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying  amendments to Ind AS 7, ‘Statement of cash flows’ and Ind AS 102,  ‘Share-based payment.
The amendments are applicable to the Group  from 1st April, 2017 amendment to ind as 7: The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that  enable users of Consolidated Financial statements to evaluate changes  in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes  arising from cash flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of  a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the balance  sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure  requirement.
The effect on the Consolidated Financial statements is being  evaluated by the Group.
amendment to ind as 102: The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance to  measurement of cash-settled awards, modification of cash-settled  awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of  withholding taxes.
It clarifies that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on a  basis consistent with that used for equity settled awards.
Market-based  performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are reflected in the  ‘fair values’, but non-market performance conditions and service vesting  conditions are reflected in the estimate of the number of awards expected  to vest.
Also, the amendment clarifies that if the terms and conditions of  a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified with the  result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction,  the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modification.
Further, the amendment requires the award that include a net settlement  feature in respect of withholding taxes to be treated as equity-settled in its  entirety.
The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part  of an equity settlement.
The effect on the Consolidated Financial statements is being evaluated by  the Group.
2.4 signiFiC ant a CC oUnting PoliCies (a) Property, Plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition cost net of   accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if  any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or  recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable  that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the  Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs  and maintenance are charged to the consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss during the period in which they are incurred.
Gains or losses arising on retirement or disposal of property, plant  and equipment  are recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for  intended use  as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in- progress”.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight line method  based on estimated useful life prescribed under Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 with the exception of the following: •	 plant	 and	equipment	is	depreciated	over	3	to	21	years	based	on	the	 technical evaluation of useful life done by the management.
•	 assets	 costing	` 5,000 or less are fully depreciated in the year of  purchase.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation of property,  plant and equipment is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.
Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Group has elected to measure  all its property, plant and equipment at the Previous GAAP carrying  amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e.,  1st April,2015.
(b) intangible assets: Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair  value at the acquisition date.
Subsequently, intangible assets are carried  at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or  indefinite.
Finite-life intangible assets are amortised on a straight- line basis over the period of their expected useful lives.
Estimated  useful lives by major class of finite-life intangible assets are as  follows: Design -  10 years Know-how - 10 years Computer software - 5 years The amortisation period and the amortisation method for finite-life  intangible assets is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.
Indefinite-life intangibles mainly consist of brands/trademarks.
The  assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether  the indefinite life continues, if not, it is impaired or changed prospectively  basis revised estimates.
Goodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business  combinations (refer note 46).
These assets are not amortised but are  tested for impairment annually.
Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure  its intangible assets at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed  cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1st April,2015.
(c) inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is  computed on a weighted average basis.
Cost of finished goods and work- in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion costs and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and  condition.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the  ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

(e)  assets held for sale: Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising of assets and liabilities  are classified as ‘held for sale’ when all of the following criterias are  met: (i) decision has been made to sell, (ii) the assets are available for  immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) the assets are being actively  marketed and (iv) sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded  within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.
Subsequently, such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as  held for sale are measured at the lower of its carrying value and fair value  less costs to sell.
Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or  amortised.
(f)  Financial instruments: Financial assets: Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instrument.
On initial recognition, a financial asset is recognised at fair value, in case of  Financial assets which are recognised at fair value through profit and loss  (FVTPL), its transaction cost are recognised in the statement of profit and  loss.
In other cases, the transaction cost are  attributed to the acquisition  value of the financial asset.
Financial assets are subsequently classified as measured at •	 amortised	cost •	 fair	value	through	profit	and	loss	(FVTPL) •	 fair	value	through	other	comprehensive	income	(FVOCI).
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their recognition,  except if and in the period the group changes its business model for  managing financial assets.
t rade Receivables and loans: Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair v alue.
Subsequently,  these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate  (EIR) method net of any expected credit losses.
The EIR is the rate that  discounts estimated future cash income through the expected life of  financial instrument.
debt instruments:  Debt instruments are initially measured at amortised cost, fair value  through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit  or loss (‘FVTPL ’) till derecognition on the basis of (i) the entity’s business  model for managing the financial assets and (ii) the contractual cash flow  characteristics of the financial asset.
(a) Measured at amortised cost: Financial assets that are held within a  business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to  collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal  and interest, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest rate (‘EIR’) method less impairment, if any.
The  amortisation of EIR and loss arising from impairment, if any is  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(b) Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income:   Financial assets that are held within a business model whose  objective is achieved by both, selling financial assets and collecting  contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest,  are subsequently measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income.
Fair value movements are recognized in  the other comprehensive income (OCI).
Interest income measured  using the EIR method and impairment losses, if any are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
On derecognition, cumulative  gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the  equity to ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(c) Measured at fair value through profit or loss: A financial asset not  classified as  either  amortised cost or FVOCI, is classified as FVTPL.
Such financial assets are measured at fair value with all changes  in fair value, including interest income and dividend income if any,  recognised as ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
equity instruments:  All investments in equity instruments classified under financial assets  are initially measured at fair value , the group may, on initial recognition,  irrevocably elect to measure the same either at FVOCI or FVTPL.
The Group makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Fair  value changes on an equity instrument is recognised as ‘other income’ in the  Statement of Profit and Loss unless the Company has elected to measure such  instrument at FVOCI.
Fair value changes excluding dividends, on an equity  instrument measured at FVOCI are recognised in OCI.
Amounts recognised  in OCI are not subsequently reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Dividend income on the investments in equity instruments are recognised as  ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the  contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset.
impairment of Financial asset Expected credit losses are recognized for all financial assets subsequent  to initial recognition other than financials assets in FVTPL category.
For financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the  Group recognises 12–month expected credit losses for all originated or  acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the  financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial recognition.
The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit  losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases significantly since  its initial recognition.
The Group’s trade receivables do not contain  significant financing component and loss allowance on trade receivables  is measured at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e.
expected  cash shortfall.
The impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Financial liabilities: initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the  contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially  150 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Consolidated Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) measured at the amortised cost unless at initial recognition, they are  classified as fair value through profit and loss.
In case of trade payables,  they are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently, these liabilities  are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
subsequent measurement Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the EIR method.
Financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or  loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognised in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the  contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(g)  Provisions and Contingent liabilities: Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal  or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure  required to settle the present obligation at the Balance Sheet date.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are  discounted to reflect its present value using a current pre-tax rate that  reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and  the risks specific to the obligation.
When discounting is used, the increase  in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that  arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of  the amount cannot be made.
(h) Revenue Recognition:  Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and  rewards of ownership in the goods are transferred to the buyer as per the  terms of the contract, there is no continuing managerial involvement with  the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The Group  retains no effective control of the goods transferred to a degree usually  associated with ownership and no significant uncertainty exists regarding  the amount of the consideration that will be derived from the sale of  goods.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or  receivable, after deduction of any trade discounts, volume rebates and any  taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government which are levied on  sales such as sales tax, value added tax, etc.
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and premium on sale  of import licenses, and lease license fee are recognised on accrual basis.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on agreements/ arrangements with the customers as the service is performed in proportion  to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date and the  amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate (EIR) method.
(i)  expenditure:  Expenses are accounted on ac crual basis.
(j)  employee Benefits: defined contribution plans  Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as employees’ state  insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation scheme, employee  pension scheme etc.
are charged as an expense based on the amount of  contribution required to be made as and when services are rendered by  the employees.
Group’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain  employees, is made to a government administered fund and charged as  an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The above benefits are  classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Group has no further  defined obligations beyond the monthly contributions.
defined benefit plans In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are  made to a trust administered by the Group.
The interest rate payable  to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate  of interest declared by the Central Government under the Employees  Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall,  if any, shall be made good by the Group.
The liability in respect of the  shortfall of interest earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis  of an actuarial valuation.
The Group also provides for retirement/post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect of certain  employees), compensated absences (in respect of certain employees) and  medical benefits including to the employees of Indian subsidiaries and a  subsidiary of parent Company.
For defined benefit plans, the amount recognised as ‘Employee benefit  expenses’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss is the cost of accruing  employee benefits promised to employees over the year and the costs  of individual events such as past/future service benefit changes and  settlements (such events are recognised immediately in the Statement  of Profit and Loss).
The amount of net interest expense calculated by  applying the liability discount rate to the net defined benefit liability  or asset is charged or credited to ‘Finance costs’ in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Any differences between the interest income on  plan assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the  liabilities over the year due to changes in actuarial assumptions or  experience adjustments within the plans, are recognised immediately in  ‘Other comprehensive income’ and subsequently not reclassified to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
The defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the Balance Sheet comprises  the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present  value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate by reference  to market yields on government bonds at the end of the reporting period).
All defined benefit plans obligations are determined based on valuations,  as at the Balance Sheet date, made by independent actuary using the  projected unit credit method.
The classification of the Group’s net obligation  into current and non-current is as per the actuarial valuation report.

151 Annual Report 2016-17 Hindustan Unilever Limited Reports Financial StatementsOverview Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting  period are discounted to their present value.
share-Based Payments: Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based  payments in consideration of the services rendered.
Under the equity settled share based payment, the fair value on the  grant date of the awards given to employees is recognised as ‘employee  benefit expenses’ with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting  period.
The fair value of the options at the grant date is calculated by  an independent valuer basis  Black Scholes model.
At the end of each  reporting period, apart from the non market vesting condition, the expense  is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of options expected  to vest.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues fresh equity  shares.
For cash-settled share based payments, the fair value of the amount  payable to employees is recognised as ‘employee benefit expenses’ with a  corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period of non market vesting  conditions getting fulfilled.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting  period up to, and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value  recognised in employee benefits expenses.
Refer Note 44 for details.
staff Bonus and staff quarters  Staff bonus and staff quarters are accounted in accordance with the  provisions of the Bonus Act, 2030 and Labor Act, 2048 respectively.
In  accordance with the decision of Honorable Supreme Court, the Group has  set aside “Employees’ Housing Reserve” for the purpose of construction of  staff quarters in line with the requirement of section 41(2) of the Labor Act,  2048.
This allocation has been done for all years including previous years  since financial year 2005-06.
(k) impairment of non-Financial assets: Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date as to  whether there is any indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired.
Indefinite life intangibles are subject to a review for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it is necessary.
For the purpose of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable  group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of  assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
Goodwill acquired in a  business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of  the Company’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from  the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or  liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable  amount of the individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
Asset/cash  generating unit whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount  are written down to the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment  loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The impairment  loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if any)  allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit,  pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Recoverable  amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less  cost of disposal and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of  estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an  asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful  life.
Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as to whether  there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised for an asset in  prior accounting periods may no longer exist or may have decreased, basis  the assessment a reversal of an impairment loss for an asset other than  goodwill is recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss account.
(l) income t axes: Income tax expense for the year comprises of current tax and deferred tax.
It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent  it relates to a business combination or to an item which is recognised  directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable/receivable on the taxable income/ loss for the year using applicable tax rates at the Balance Sheet date, and  any adjustment to taxes in respect of previous years.
Interest income/ expenses and penalties, if any, related to income tax are included in  current tax expense.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the  carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax liability is recognised based on the expected manner of  realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities,  using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, by the end of the  reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that  it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the  asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting  date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related  tax benefit will be realised.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a  legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is  an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.
Deferred  tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally  enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities;  and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income  taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
(m) leases: Leases in which a substantial portion of the risks and rewards of ownership  are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments and  receipts under such leases are recognised to the Statement of Profit and  Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the lease  payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected  general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost  increases, in which case the same are recognised as an expense in line  with the contractual term.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease  transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to  the lessee.
(n)  Foreign Currencies: The Consolidated Financial statements are presented in `, the functional  currency of the group.
Items included in the Consolidated Financial  statements of the Group are recorded using the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the Group operates (the ‘functional  currency’).
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency  using exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains  and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of  monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date, exchange rates are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
(o) earnings Per share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit for the  period attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted  average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.
The  152 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2016-17 Consolidated Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)
(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period  and for all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares,  other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in  resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for  the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average  number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
(p) Business Combination: Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting  method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which  control is transferred to the Group.
The consideration transferred in the  acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  are recognised at fair values on their acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially  measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration  transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and  any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities assumed.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest  in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at  fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the  acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.
Consideration transferred does  not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, other than those incurred  in relation to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent  consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to first time adoption, the  Group has elected to apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations  prospectively from 1st April, 2015.
As such, Previous GAAP balances  relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including  goodwill, have been carried forward as at the date of transition to Ind AS.
(q)  Borrowing Costs: Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction  or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of  time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the  cost of the asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period  in which they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs  that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Borrowing  cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an  adjustment to the borrowing costs.
(r)  operating segments: The managing committee is considered to be the ‘Chief Operating Decision  Maker’ (CODM) as defined in IND AS 108.
The Operating Segment is the  level at which discrete financial information is available.
The CODM  allocates resources and assess performance at this level.
The group has  identified the below operating segments: 1.
Home Care - Fabric Wash, Household care and Water 2.
Personal Care -  Personal Wash, Skin Care, Hair Care, Oral  Care, Deodorants and colours 3.
Foods - Packaged foods and popular foods  4.
Refreshments - Tea, Coffee, Ice Creams and Frozen Deserts.

These consolidated financial statements for the year  ended 31st March, 2017 are the first the Group has prepared under Ind AS.
For all periods upto and including the year ended 31st March, 2016 , the Group  prepared its financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards  notified under the section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with  paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 ('Previous GAAP').
The adoption of Ind AS has been carried out in accordance with Ind AS 101,  First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards.
Ind AS 101 requires  that all Ind AS standards and interpretations that are issued and effective  for the first Ind AS financial statements be applied retrospectively and  consistently for all financial years presented.
Accordingly, the Group has  prepared financial statements which comply with Ind AS for year ended  31st March, 2017, together with the comparative information as at and for  the year ended 31st March, 2016 and the opening Ind AS Balance Sheet as  at 1st April, 2015, the date of transition to Ind AS.
In preparing these Ind AS consolidated financial statements, the Group has  availed certain exemptions and exceptions in accordance with Ind AS 101,  as explained below.
The resulting difference between the carrying values of  the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements as at the  transition date under Ind AS and Previous GAAP have been recognised directly  in equity (retained earnings or another appropriate category of equity).
This note  explains the adjustments made by the Group in restating its Previous GAAP  financial statements, including the Balance Sheet as at 1st April, 2015 and the  consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31st March, 2016. a. optional exemptions from retrospective application Ind AS 101 permits first-time adopters certain exemptions from retrospective  application of certain requirements under Ind AS.
The Group has elected to  apply the following optional exemptions from retrospective application: (a) Business combinations Ind AS 103 Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of  subsidiaries, or of interests in associates and joint ventures and transactions  which are considered businesses for Ind AS, that occurred before 1st  April, 2015.
The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in accordance  with Previous GAAP are considered as their deemed cost at the date of  acquisition.
After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance  with Ind AS.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the opening Ind AS Balance  Sheet is its carrying amount in accordance with the Previous GAAP.
(b) deemed cost for property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets The Group has elected to measure all its property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed  cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.
(c) share-based payments The Group has elected not to apply Ind AS 102 Share-Based Payment, to  equity instruments that vested prior to the date of transition to Ind AS.
(d) Joint arrangements The Group has elected to measure the investment in the joint venture in  Kimberly Clark Lever Private Limited in the consolidated financial statements  at the deemed cost of the investment at the date of transition to Ind AS.
Accordingly, the investment has been measured at the aggregate of the carrying  amounts of the assets and liabilities that had been previously proportionately  consolidated under the Previous GAAP for year ended 31st March, 2015.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) B.
Mandatory exceptions to retrospective application The Group has applied the following exceptions to the retrospective  application of Ind AS as mandatorily required under Ind AS 101: (a) estimates On assessment of the estimates made under the Previous GAAP financial  statements, the Group has concluded that there is no necessity to revise  the estimates under Ind AS, as there is no objective evidence that those  estimates were in error.
However, estimates that were required under Ind  AS but not required under Previous GAAP are made by the Group for the  relevant reporting dates reflecting conditions existing as at that date.
(b) Classification and measurement of financial assets The classification of financial assets to be measured at amortised  cost or fair value through other comprehensive income is made on  the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed on the date of  transition to Ind AS.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) notes to ReC onCiliations (a) investment in Controlled t rust  Under Previous GAAP, the investment in the Hindustan Unilever Limited Securitisation of Retirement Benefit Trust ('HURB Trust') did not qualify as  plan asset under AS 15 and has been consolidated as a wholly controlled trust in the Group financial statements and the investments in the trust  have been reflected as a non current investment .
Under Ind AS, the HURB Trust qualifies as a plan asset and hence has not been consolidated as  this is excluded under Ind A S 110 and the previously consolidated assets and liabilities have no longer been aggregated at the date of transition to  Ind AS.
Additionally, given that the investment is a plan asset for the Group, The plan asset has been fair valued as per actuarial valuation carried  in accordance with Ind AS on date of transition to Ind AS and as at each balance sheet date.
The plan asset recognised has been netted off against  provision for employee benefits.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) (f) other non-Current liabilities  Under Previous GAAP, non-curr ent liabilities are recognised on undiscounted basis.
Ind AS requires such liabilities to be recognised at present value  (discounted value) where the effect of time value of money is material.
This led to a decrease in the value of non-current liabilities on the date of  transition which was adjusted against retained earnings.
Ind AS also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying amount of the liability  increases in each period to reflect the passage of time.
This increase is recognised as finance cost.

The above difference, together with the  consequential tax impact of the other Ind AS transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences.
Deferred tax adjustments are recognised in  correlation to the underlying transaction either in retained earnings or through other comprehensive income.

However, under Ind AS, sale of goods includes excise duty.
Excise duty  on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of Statement of Profit and Loss.

Under Ind AS, the Group has adopted the accounting policy  to recognise interest income/expense related to income tax as part of income tax expense.
Accordingly, the interest on income tax refund has been  reclassified from 'Other income' to 'Tax expenses - Current tax' for the year ended 31st March, 2016. debit / (Credit) debit / (Credit) Balance sheet statement of  profit and loss  as at   1st april, 2015   as at   31st March, 2016   Year ended   31st March, 2016  (Profit)/loss: Other income  -    -    8 Tax expenses - Current tax  -    -    (8)  (l) non-Current Provisions  Under Previous GAAP, non-current provisions are recognised on undiscounted basis.
Ind AS requires such provisions to be recognised at present  value (discounted value) where the effect of time value of money is material.
This led to a decrease in the value of non-current provisions for the year  ended 31st March,2016 which was recognised in 'Exceptional items' in the Statement of Profit and Loss where the underlying provision was initially  recognised.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) (m) defined Benefit Plans a.
Actuarial gain/(loss) - Under Previous GAAP, the actuarial gain/(loss) of defined benefit plans has been recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss as an  exceptional item.
Under Ind AS, the remeasurement gain/(loss) on net defined benefit plans is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income net of tax.
b.
Net interest cost on defined benefit plans - Under Previous GAAP, the interest cost on defined benefit liability and expected return on plan  assets is recognised as employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Under Ind AS, the Group has adopted the accounting  policy to recognise the net interest cost on defined benefit plans as finance cost.

Under Ind AS, the security deposits for leases have  been recognised at discounted value and the difference between undiscounted and discounted value has been recognised as ‘Deferred lease rent’  which has been amortised over respective lease term as rent expense under ‘other expenses’.
The discounted value of the security deposits is  increased over the period of lease term by recognising the notional interest income under ‘other income’.
Under Previous GAAP, lease payments are required to be recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Under Ind AS, lease payments  which are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases, are  required to be recognised as an expense in line with its contractual term.
Accordingly, the provision for scheduled increases on operating lease  recognised under Previous GAAP has been written back under Ind AS.

The goodwill and brand  (with indefinite life) acquired through business combination has been entirely allocated to CGU ‘Personal Care’ segment of the Company.
The carrying  amount of goodwill and brand as at 31st March, 2017 is ` 0 crores and ` 311 crores respectively.
Following key assumptions were considered while performing Impairment testing Long term sustainable growth rates 7% Weighted Average Cost of Capital % (WACC) before tax 13% Average segmental margins 24% The projections cover a period of five years, as we believe this to be the most appropriate timescale over which to review and consider annual performances  before applying a fixed terminal value multiple to the final year cash flows.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance are based on the  conservative estimates from past performance.
Segmental margins are based on FY 2016-17 performance.
Weighted Average Cost of Capital % (WACC)  =  Risk free return + ( Market risk premium x Beta variant for the Company) We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions and have concluded that no reasonable  changes in key assumptions would cause  the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than the carrying value.
B goodwill on consolidation Pursuant to the merger of Aquagel Chemicals Private Limited(ACPL) with Lakme Lever Private Limited in the FY 14-15, the excess of cost to the Group of  its investment in ACPL over the group’s portion of equity in ACPL, amounting to ` 81 crores has been treated as ‘Goodwill on consolidation’.
The goodwill  on consolidation is tested for impairment and accordingly no impairments charges were identified for FY 2016-17 (Nil for FY 2015-16) 171 Annual Report 2016-17 Hindustan Unilever Limited Reports Financial StatementsOverview Notes  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2017 (Contd.)

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)  and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The categories used are as follows: •	Level	1:	Quoted	prices	for	identical	instruments	in	an	active	market; •	Level	2:	Directly	or	indirectly	observable	market	inputs,	other	than	Level	1	inputs;	and •	Level	3:	Inputs	which	are	not	based	on	observable	market	data.

C al CUlation oF F aiR V al Ues The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent  with those used for the year ended 31st March, 2016.
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at Balance sheet date: 1.
The fair values of investment in treasury bills, government securities and quoted investment in equity shares is based on the current bid price of  respective investment as at the Balance Sheet date.
2.
The fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value (‘NAV’) as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in  the published statements as at Balance Sheet date.
NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the  price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.
3.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques with market observable inputs.
The models  incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties and foreign exchange forward rates.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) 4.
Financial liabilities valued using Level 2 valuation techniques comprise of borrowing including deferred borrowings of ` 280 crores (March 31,  2016: ` 180 crores) from bank under the scheme issued by Government namely, Interest Equalisation on Pre and Post Shipment Rupee Export  Credit.
The fair values of borrowings are determined by using DCF method, using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the  end of the reporting period.
The own non performance risk as at 31st March 2017 and 31st March 2016 was assessed to be insignificant.
Other financial assets and liabilities  -  Cash and cash equivalents (except for investments in mutual funds), trade receivables, investments in term deposits, other financial assets  (except derivative financial instruments), trade payables, and other financial liabilities (except derivative financial instruments) have fair values  that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.
-  Loans have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts as it is based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows  using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

42 FinanCial RisK ManageMent The Group business activities are exposed  to a variety of financial risks, namely liquidity risk, market risks and credit risk.
The Group senior management  has the overall responsibility for establishing and governing the Group risk management framework.
The Group has constituted a Risk Management  Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group risk management policies.
The Group risk management policies are established  to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set and monitor appropriate risk limits and controls, periodically review the changes in market  conditions and reflect the changes in the policy accordingly.
The key risks and mitigating actions are also placed before the Audit Committee of the Company.
a .
ManageMent  oF liQUidit Y RisK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group approach to managing  liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.
In doing this, management  considers both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group maintained a cautious liquidity strategy, with a positive cash balance throughout the year ended 31st March, 2017 and 31st March, 2016.
Cash  flow from operating activities provides the funds to service and finance the financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis.
The Group regularly monitors the rolling forecasts to ensure it has sufficient cash on an on-going basis to meet operational needs.
Any short term  surplus cash generated , over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash  and cash equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in interest bearing term deposits and other highly marketable debt investments  with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring  sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities.
The following table shows the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows along with its  carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

ManageMent  oF MaRKet  RisK The Group size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: 	 •	 currency	risk;	 	 •	 price	risk;		and 	 •	 interest	rate	risk The above risks may affect the Group income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments.
The Group exposure to and management of these  risks are explained below.

CURRenCY RisK The Group is subject to the risk that changes  in foreign currency values impact the Group  exports revenue and imports of raw material  and property, plant and equipment.
As at 31st March, 2017, the net unhedged  exposure to the Group on holding financial  assets (trade receivables and Capital advances)  and liabilities (trade payables and capital  creditors) other than in their functional currency  amounted to ` 5 crores payable (31st March,  2016: ` 8 crores).
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange  risk arising from various currency exposures,  primarily with respect to US Dollar and Euro.
The Group manages currency exposures  within prescribed limits, through use of  forward exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange  transactions are covered with strict limits placed  on the amount of uncovered exposure, if any, at  any point in time.
The aim of the Group’s approach to  management  of currency risk is to leave the Group with no  material residual risk.
A 5% strengthening of the INR against key  currencies to which the Group is exposed (net  of hedge) would have led to approximately an  additional ` 0 crores gain in the Statement of  Profit and Loss (2015-16: ` 0 crores gain).
A 5%  weakening of the INR against these currencies  would have led to an equal but opposite effect.

PRiCe RisK The Group is mainly exposed to the price risk due  to its investment in debt mutual funds.
The price  risk arises due to uncertainties about the future  market values of these investments.
At 31st March 2017, the investments in debt  mutual funds amounts to ` 2329 crores (31st  March, 2016:   ` 1296 crores and 1st April, 2015: ` 974 crores).
These are exposed to price risk   The Group has laid  policies and guidelines  which it adheres to in order to minimise pricing  risk  arising from investments in debt mutual  funds.
A 1% increase in prices would have led to  approximately an additional ` 23 crores gain in  the Statement of Profit and Loss (2015-16: ` 13  crores gain).
A 1% decrease in prices would have  led to an equal but opposite effect.
3. inteRest Rate RisK The Group is mainly exposed to the interest rate  risk due to its investment in treasury bills and  government securities.
The interest rate risk  arises due to uncertainties about the future  market interest rate of these investments.
The Group has laid  policies and guidelines  including  tenure of investment made to minimise  impact of interest rate risk A 0.25% decrease in interest rates would have led  to approximately an additional ` 1 crores gain in the  Statement of Profit and Loss (2015-16:  `  1 crores  gain).
A 0.25% decrease in interest rates would have  led to an equal but opposite effect.
The Group majorly invests in term deposits for  a period of less than one year.
Considering the  short-term nature, there is no significant interest  rate risk pertaining to these deposits.
As at 31st March 2017, the investments in  treasury bill and borrowings amounts to ` 1192  crores (31st March, 2016: ` 1,233 crores and 1st  April, 2015: ` 1,946 crores).
These are exposed to  interest rate risk.
C.  ManageMent  oF CRedit  RisK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations.
t rade receivables Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse.
All trade receivables  are reviewed and assessed for default on a quarterly basis.
Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low and so trade receivables are considered to  be a single class of financial assets.
Refer note 2.4(f) for accounting policy on Financial Instruments.
other financial assets The Group maintains exposure in cash and cash equivalents, term deposits with banks, investments in treasury bills, government securities, money  market liquid mutual funds with financial institutions and derivative financial instruments.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31st March, 2017, 2016 and 1st April, 2015 is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

(All amounts in ` crores, unless otherwise stated) governance  The trustees of the trust fund are responsible for the overall governance of the plan and to act in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed and  rules in the best interests of the plan participants.
They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the fund and play a role in the long-term  investment, risk management and funding strategy.
investment strategy The Group’s investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the applicable statutory requirements.
The plans  expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and inflation risk.
The Group has developed  policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and  long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversified, such that the failure  of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
During the year the Group has amended its discretionary increase clause with respect to post retirement benefit plan, which has resulted into  `115  crores credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
