Several  innovations were launched to meet the  emerging needs and aspirations of our  consumers.
We expanded our reach and  further strengthened our distribution so  that we can serve our consumers better  with our wide range of product offerings.
At the same time, we continued to make  significant progress on our Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan.
During the year, Unilever increased its  stake	in	your	Company	from	52.48%	to	 67.25%	through	an	open	offer.
The	open	 offer reflects Unilever’s confidence in the  long term growth opportunity of the Indian  market and more importantly its strong  commitment to investing and driving the  growth of your Company.
The business environment continued to  remain muted.
Despite the Indian economy  witnessing a slowdown, your Company  delivered healthy results.
Our domestic  consumer	business	grew	by	9%	with	4%	 underlying volume growth which was  ahead of the market.
Profit before interest  expanded	our	direct	retail	reach	and	 strengthened	our	in	store	execution.
We	 extended	our	Perfect	Stores	programme	 to	1	million	stores	by	the	end	of	2013.
The	 on-shelf availability in modern trade  touched an all-time high with many of our  key customers recognising us as the  Supplier of Choice.
In	2013,	we	significantly	increased	our	 Shakti	network	adding	over	17,000	Shakti	 Entrepreneurs (Shaktiammas).
Project  Shakti	now	has	over	65,000	Shakti	 Entrepreneurs complemented by over  50,000	Shaktimaans,	the	male	members	 of the Shakti family who distribute  Company products on bicycles.
It was once again ‘business unusual on  costs’ across the board with significant  savings in Supply Chain and Overheads  and improvements in the effectiveness of  our Trade and Marketing spends.
These  savings helped to sustain competitive  investments behind our brands and deliver  a steady improvement in the operating  margin.
We made good progress on the Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan.
In line with our  belief of doing well by doing good, we  launched the ‘Perfect Village’  programme across eight states.
Under  this initiative, we created awareness about  health and wellbeing among rural  consumers and at the same time,  improved the availability of our products in  these villages.
The Lifebuoy Handwashing  Programme	now	touches	58	million	 consumers in India.
Lifebuoy’s ‘Help a Child Reach 5’  Handwashing Programme was launched  in Thesgora, a village in Madhya Pradesh,  last year.
With our interventions, the  incidence of diarrhoea dropped  significantly.
This campaign is now being  and	tax	(PBIT)	grew	by	12%	with	PBIT	 margin	improving	40	bps.
Profit	after	tax	 but	before	exceptional	items,	PAT	(bei),	 grew	by	7%	to	Rs.
3,555	crores	with	Net	 Profit	at	Rs.
3,867	crores	growing	2%.
Net	 Profit growth was impacted by the  significant property sale in the previous  year.
Cash generated from operations at  over	Rs.
5,000	crores	for	the	year, was	up	 Rs.
462 crores over the previous year.
With  the	final	dividend	of	Rs.
7.50	per	share	 proposed by the Board of Directors and an  interim	dividend	of	Rs.
5.50	per	share	 already paid, the total dividend for the  financial	year	ending	31 March	2014	 amounts	to	Rs.
13.00	per	share.
Innovations touched most of our product  portfolio and delivered strong growth.
We  launched a host of innovations across our  businesses by leveraging Unilever’s global  portfolio of brands, research and  technology.
Surf	Excel	launched	the	first	 main-wash	liquid	detergent	in	May.
Domex	 Zero Stain was launched reinstating the  cleaning	properties	of	Domex.
In	personal	 care we launched the ‘Best Ever’ Fair &  Lovely,	Pond’s	BB+	cream,	Lakmé	CC	 cream and Vaseline Healthy White.
Hair  Care and Skin Care brands were  premiumised	with	Lakmé	Pro-Stylist,	 TRESemmé	and	Toni&Guy	being	some	of	 the innovations this year.
In beverages,  green tea was added to the Lipton and Taj  Mahal range.
Magnum, Unilever’s most  premium ice cream brand globally, was  launched	in	Chennai	in	2013	and	has	been	 extended	to	more	cities	this	year.
Pureit,	 launched the best in class water purifier,  Pureit	Ultima	RO	+	UV.
The	dual	 technology	of	RO	+	UV	removes	harmful	 chemicals like lead, arsenic and mercury,  ensuring that the water is always pure and  safe for drinking.

It aims to  build momentum behind a growing  community of people who believe it is  possible to build a world where everyone  lives well and sustainably, without  compromising the needs of future  generations.
We continue to focus on attracting,  retaining and developing the best talent.
This year, we retained our position as the  No.
1	Employer	Brand	among	premier	 business school students for the third  successive year and as a ‘Dream  Employer’ for the fifth consecutive year.

Best Regards, Harish Manwani Chairman Board of Directors  4  5 7 Annual Report 2013-14 OUR   BUSINESS  MODEL Our business model is designed to deliver  sustainable growth.
For us, sustainability is  integral to how we do business.
In a world  where temperatures are rising, water is  scarce, energy is expensive, sanitation is  poor in many areas, and food supplies are  uncertain and expensive, we have both a  duty and an opportunity to address these  issues in the way we do business.
OUR COMPASS STRATEGY We call our business strategy document  ‘the Compass’, since it sets out a constant  path for Unilever for the long term.
First  developed	in	2009,	it	was	sharpened	in	 2012	but	its	core	elements	remained	the	 same.
The Compass sets out our  ambitious Vision and Purpose, and defines  four non-negotiable commitments within  the business that we believe will help us  achieve both: winning with brands and  innovation; winning in the marketplace;  winning through continuous improvement;  and winning with people.
Our Statement of  Purpose is also the title of our Annual  Report.
The Compass gives life to our determination  to build a sustainable business for the long  term and to find new ways to operate that do  not just take from society and the  environment.
This is captured in the Unilever  Sustainable Living Plan (USLP).
SUSTAINABLE LIVING For	us,	sustainable,	equitable	growth	is	the	 only acceptable business model.
Business  needs to be a regenerative force in the  system	that	gives	it	life.
For	example,	by	 reducing waste we create efficiencies and  reduce costs, helping to improve margins  while reducing risk.
Meanwhile, looking at  more sustainable ways of developing  products, sourcing and manufacturing  opens up opportunities for innovation while  improving the livelihoods of our suppliers.
Our USLP is the means by which we seek  to achieve sustainable growth.
The USLP  has three big global goals: IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING  By	2020	we	will	help	more	than	a	billion	 people take action to improve their health  and well-being.
REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT By	2020	our	goal	is	to	halve	the	 environmental footprint of the making  and use of our products as we grow  our business.
ENHANCING LIVELIHOODS By	2020	we	will	enhance	the	livelihoods  of millions of people  as we grow  our business.
See page 16 OUR OPERATIONS On any given day 2 billion consumers use  Unilever products.
We want to reach many more, by  developing innovative products that address different  consumer needs at different price points.
To do this, we use  our global scale to help deliver sustainable, profitable growth by  seeking to add value at every step in the value chain by enhancing  product	quality	and	customer	service	and	rolling	out	innovations	 faster across markets.
See page 14 OUR PEOPLE Sustainable, profitable growth  can be achieved with the right  people working in an organisation  that has a culture where  performance is aligned with values.
We are an agile and diverse business  with people motivated by doing good  while doing well.
We are building  capability and leadership among  our people and attracting some of  the best talent in the   marketplace.
See page 12 OUR BRANDS Strong brands and innovation are central   to our ambition to deliver consistent,  competitive, profitable and responsible  growth.
We	are	investing	in	brand	equity,	 finding and strengthening the connections  between consumers and the products they  buy.
Strong	brand	equities	enable	us	to	 create efficiencies by focusing on fewer,  bigger projects that enhance margins.
And  we are seeking superior products which  consumers will prefer, driving profitable  growth.
See page 10 Our Business Model Hindustan Unilever Limited8 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder Information PROFITABLE VOLUME  GROWTH Profitable volume growth is the basis of  the virtuous circle of growth.
Stronger  brands and innovation are the key drivers  behind it.
Consistently strong volume  growth	builds	brand	equity	as	we	reach	 more consumers, more often.
COST LEVERAGE +  EFFICIENCY Profitable volume growth allows us to  optimise the utilisation of our  infrastructure	and	spread	fixed	costs	over	 a larger number of units produced,  reducing the average cost per unit.
It  improves our profitability and allows us to  invest in the business.
INNOVATION + MARKETING  INVESTMENT Lower costs and improved efficiency  enable us to invest behind our brands to  strengthen our business further.
New and  improved products are the result of  investment in R&D and, together with  effective marketing, strengthen our brand  equity.
This	results	in	profitable	volume	 growth, self perpetuating the virtuous  circle of growth.
OUR BUSINESS MODEL The inputs  to our business model, like  those of all major packaged goods  manufacturers, are threefold: brands;  people; and operations.
These map  directly on to our Compass ‘winning with’  commitments – with both continuous  improvement and the marketplace pillars  supporting the operations strand of the  model.
The differentiator in our business model is  our USLP and the goal of sustainable  living.
The outputs  of the model are threefold:  sustained growth; lower environmental  impact; and positive social impact.
The diagram represents our virtuous  circle of growth.
It summarises, simply,  how we derive profit from our business  model.

OUR BRANDS WIN CONSUMER PREFERENCE LEVERAGE BIGGER BRANDS BUILDING BRAND EQUITIES INNOVATION + MARKETING INVESTMENT PROFITABLE VOLUME GROWTH COST LEVERAGE + EFFICIENCY Our Brands Hindustan Unilever Limited10 EXPANDING SHAKTI  REACH In	2013,	we	had 65,000 Shakti Entrepreneurs  (Shaktiammas)	and	50,000	 Shaktimaans	across	16	states	 who	covered	160,000	villages	 and reached around 4 million  rural households.
REACHING OUR  CUSTOMERS: ADDING   1 MILLION STORES Expansion	of	distribution	reach	 across urban and rural markets was  one of the key thrust areas.
This  resulted in the addition of one million  stores	to	our	existing	network.
A new low cost distribution model  was developed to leverage the  increasing penetration of mobile  phones among the bottom-of-the- pyramid retailers.
Taking orders  through tele-calling saved time and  led to a significant cut in front end  distribution cost.
Reduction in  servicing cost enabled us to reach  more shoppers who purchase  from those marginal outlets outside  the purview of our traditional  distribution model.
PERFECT VILLAGES In	2013,	we	went	to	8,500	villages	 across India through school contact  and Mohalla programmes.
Through  these school activities, Lifebuoy  educated children on the importance  and correct method of handwashing.
Pepsodent also educated them on the  importance and correct method of  brushing teeth.
In the Mohalla  activity, we demonstrated the  benefits of new and emerging  categories such as facewash, hair  conditioners and fabric conditioners  to the women in the village.
We  touched the lives of over three million  consumers in these villages through  these programmes.
We ensured the  availability of these new product  categories in the retail outlets of  these villages through the Perfect  Stores programme.
DRIVING HEALTH AND  HYGIENE Domex	launched	Domex	Toilet	 Academy (DTA) on the occasion of  World	Toilet	Day	on	November	19.
The academy aims to build toilets in  areas where people do not have  access to improved sanitation and  face a problem of  open defecation.
REDUCING CARBON  FOOTPRINT Our	frozen	desserts	business	moved	 into procuring technologically  advanced Hydrocarbon (HC)  refrigerant-based	freezers	with	a	 zero	ozone	depletion	potential	for	its	 retail operations.
Kwality Walls has  37,500	HC	refrigerant-based	freezer	 cabinets in India, which are a  significant reduction in our carbon  footprint.
Through innovation in packaging of  instant coffee and dry foods, we are  now on a journey to reduce the use  of plastic laminate in our product  packaging.
ENHANCING  LIVELIHOODS The	65,000	Shakti	Entrepreneurs	 (Shaktiammas)	across	16	states	 cover	160,000	villages	and	reach	 around four million rural households.
In	2013,	we	continued	our	focus	on	 stabilising the Shakti DMS (a  mobile-based mini ERP solution) to  help improve the sales and earnings  of Shaktiammas.
Project Xpress, our rural distribution  alliance with Tata Teleservices for  distributing their telecom products  through our distribution network,  helped in enhancing the earning  potential of our partners, including  Shaktiammas.
We are now nationally  distributing telecom products to  75,000	telecom	outlets	through	our	 distribution network.
DRIVING NEW CATEGORIES The Perfect Village initiative was conceptualised to drive growth of  our brands in rural India.
The focus of the programme was to  develop the market, driving growth in the Tender Loving Care  categories such as hair conditioners, facewashes, body lotions,  fabric	conditioners	and	liquid	handwash.
Launched	in	March	2013	in	eight	key	states	across	India,	the	 project involved holding ‘Mohalla sessions’ with consumers and  educating them about new categories, their benefits and on the  right usage.
This helps to drive the Unilever Sustainable Living  Plan agenda of improving health and hygiene.

A GENDER BALANCED  WORKFORCE HUL aims to become a gender  balanced organisation.
We have a  roadmap in place and are creating  enablers to ensure a culture of  inclusion.
‘Career by Choice’, a  re-hire programme that provides a  platform for women looking for real  opportunities	to	work	flexibly	and	 part-time on live business projects,  is one such enabler.
With these  enablers, our Company has seen a  significant shift in the Gender  Balance Ratio over the last three years.
DEVELOPING LEADERS  FOR THE FUTURE HUL is well-known for nurturing  talent and building leaders, driven by  the ‘leaders build leaders’  philosophy.
Such a mindset ensures  that leadership gets ingrained in all  people across the Company, rather  than placing it as the responsibility of  a function or a few individuals.
This is  exemplified	through	our	 Management Trainee programme,  commonly known as the Unilever  Future Leaders Programme that has  been the training ground for many  inspiring leaders across HUL and  Unilever.
A LEARNING CULTURE  OF 70:20:10  We	follow	a	holistic	70:20:10	 capability building approach across  functions.
We	believe	that	70%	of	all	 capability	is	built	on	the	job,	20%	 through coaching and short term  projects	and	10%	through	classroom	 learning.
There are multiple forums  for	learning	including	quarterly	 webcasts, regular guest sessions  from industry stalwarts and portals  to ensure a constant flow of best  practices.
Our learning practices are  best-in-class	with	over	28,000	 man-days invested in classroom  training	and	~38,000	e-learning	 courses	completed	in	2013.

We have also undertaken initiatives to cut  down	on	complexity	in	terms	of	processes,	 and improved speed of decision-making  and speed to the market.
ENSURING SAFETY AT THE  WORKPLACE   Our mission is to protect and enhance the  well-being of our employees, visitors and  partners.
Safe working is non-negotiable.
We have a clear focus on safety practices  ensuring	all	possible	safety	hazards	are	 eliminated; not just from the work place  but during travel and at employee homes.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS We have undertaken a host of  programmes in the space of capability  building on the shopfloor.
Our Shopfloor  Skill Upgradation Programme, ‘Sparkle’, is  an intranet-based tool that assesses  training needs, skill and performance.
Stepping Into One (SIO) helps develop  technical and leadership skills among  shopfloor employees and provides them  career advancement opportunities into  supervisory roles.

STRENGTHENING  PARTNERSHIPS Our Partner to Win programme aims  at developing a business plan with  suppliers and business partners in  order to reduce lead time,  procurement cost, improve reliability  and new innovation delivery.
Project  Procure To Pay Transformation was  launched to move the needle on our  services to suppliers from vendor  satisfaction to vendor delight.
This  year, we standardised and  centralised payments process from  over	40	locations	to	one	Payment	 Excellence	Centre.
To strengthen our distribution  channel and empower our partners,  the	existing	technology	backbone	 was leveraged to provide for a low  cost phone based solution that  significantly saved costs of selling  our products.
Analytics-based  algorithms that have been fine tuned  for	urban	distribution	were	extended	 to the rural distribution system  to improve the effectiveness of  sales calls.
IMPROVING   ECO-EFFICIENCY Sustainability is embedded in our  operations; be it sourcing,  manufacturing or logistics.
For every  tonne	of	production	in	2013	we	 reduced CO2	emissions	by	27%	in	 India,	compared	to	the	2008	baseline.
Use of renewable energy increased  to	over	20%	of	the	total	consumption	 while water usage in manufacturing  operations	reduced	by	over	37%	 compared	to	the	2008	baseline.

CCFOT (Customer  Case	fill-on-Time)	increased	to	94%	 and On-Shelf-Availability in Modern  Trade touched an all time high of  96%.
Our	customers	acknowledged	 this and declared us ‘the best  supplier of the year’.
We continued to  strengthen the Sales and Operation  Planning process (S&OP) and  Innovation Process Management  (IPM) in order to proactively drive  competitive growth as well as to  respond to market demands with  speed and agility.

EXECUTING  EXCELLENCE An increased number of innovation  networks	were	executed	this	year	 and	touched	about	60%	of	the	 product portfolio.
The focus on  bigger, faster innovation and  capability development significantly  helped in launching innovations first  time right.
To achieve manufacturing  excellence,	HUL	embarked	on	a	 journey of setting up world-class  manufacturing sites focusing on  identification, root-cause analysis  and elimination of non-value added  activities to lead to improvement in  efficiencies.
Several initiatives were undertaken  to	reduce	cost,	complexity	and	 processing	time	required	for	 transactions.
A global financial  excellence	centre	was	set	up	in	 Bengaluru and a programme was  launched that converts data into  insights with just a click of a button.
This will enable faster decision  making, whilst significantly reducing  the efforts on information  management.
We continued the simplification  agenda that started last year by  appropriately investing in IT.
This  resulted in significant savings in  audit effort.
In	2013,	we	won	the	esteemed	Silver	 Shield from the Institute of Chartered  Accountants	of	India	for	excellence	in	 financial reporting for HUL annual  report	for	2012-13.
We	continue	to	 focus	on	delivering	excellence	in	 Financial Accounting and Reporting.
DELIVERING SAVINGS The focus on costs was even more  pronounced this year given the tough  business environment.
A strong  Supply Chain saving programme  driven by various cross functional  teams such as R&D, Procurement,  Manufacturing and Logistics  delivered strong savings across the  Supply Chain.
Key cost savings initiatives like  freight cost optimisation through  re-aligning sourcing networks,  energy	saving	capex	being	deployed	 across units, consolidation of  sourcing footprint was activated  across the board.
This helped in  delivering a healthy contribution to  the margins of the Company.

9	 INCLUSIVE  BUSINESS The Plan is helping to drive profitable  growth for our brands, save costs and fuel  innovation.
Our Plan sets out three big  goals.
Underpinning these goals are nine  commitments supported by targets  spanning our social, environmental and  economic performance.
EVOLUTION OF OUR PLAN We have learnt a great deal since we  launched the Plan three years ago.
In	2013	we	undertook	an	in-depth	review	 with every product category and business  function.
We identified actions that will  help us drive sustainable growth faster  and remove barriers to progress.
As a result we have broadened our Plan  with a more substantive and far-reaching  Enhancing Livelihoods programme.
Alongside our new Livelihoods  commitments, we have also revised some  targets to ensure we can achieve our  long-term ambitions, which remain  undiminished.

17.88 17.56 Directors’ Report Directors’ Report32 33Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 In the domestic market, growth continued to be muted with the  second successive year of sub 5% GDP growth.
The year saw  steep currency depreciation in an environment where industrial  activity remained in contraction mode, consumption demand  continued to weaken, while lacklustre capital goods production  pointed to stalled investment demand.
With sluggish growth across the larger economy, further  compounded by high consumer inflation and weak sentiment,  market growth across FMCG categories moderated throughout  the year in both volume and value terms.
The discretionary  categories and premium segments were particularly under  pressure.
The operating context for the year was challenging,  given the backdrop of a market slowdown, a volatile input cost  environment and heightened competitive intensity.
Your Company’s performance for the year 2013-14 has to  be viewed in the context of aforesaid economic and market  environment.
5.
PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESSES AND  CATEGORIES 5.1.
Home & Personal Care (HPC)  The Home & Personal Care (HPC) business consists of Soaps,  Detergents, Household Care and Personal Products, which  includes categories like Skin Care, Hair Care, Oral Care, Colour  Cosmetics and Deodorants.
During the year, the HPC business  registered robust growth ahead of market.
The opportunity for growth in India continues to be immense  across all HPC categories.
This fact is also reflected in high  levels of competitive intensity in the marketplace.
Your Company  believes that both unwavering focus on competitive growth in  core categories as well as market development to build segments  of future are critical for sustained growth and long term value  creation.

There were also regulatory changes in the space of media  availability, leading to more efficient media buying and better  deployment of non-TV led media.

At the same time, strengthening the presence across key  price points in dishwash bars helped reach new consumers in  rural India.
Domex strengthened the toilet cleaning business  through the launch of an innovative product, Domex Zero Stain.
The innovation, aimed at hygiene conscious users who have  high incidence of stain problem in toilets, has helped fuel brand  growth.

In addition, your Company launched Toni&Guy,  another premium brand from the global Unilever hair portfolio.
It is the first time that your Company launched the brand through  e-commerce.
Going forward, Toni&Guy will be rolled out in  select stores across India.
Your Company continued to focus on  market development by investing strongly behind the emerging  high potential hair conditioners segment, thereby growing ahead  of the market.

5.2.1.
Beverages The Beverages segment delivered 12.4% turnover growth in the  year, well ahead of the market, on the back of a strong double  digit performance in Tea.
This was accompanied by a significant  step up in segmental profits which increased by 22.4%.
At the onset of the year, the Packet Tea market witnessed steep  commodity inflation which drove market to volume decline.
Despite this environment, your Company delivered competitive  and profitable growth.
The double digit growth across all brands  was driven by a strengthened mix and focused in-market activities.
Your Company drove its five leading brand positions across India,  with all brands recording healthy volume growth and growing  across major geographies.

Your  Company strengthened its position in every segment of tea bags  market, particularly flavoured and green tea.
The Instant Coffee market was challenged for growth in the  context of steep commodity inflation in the previous year with  the accompanying drop in consumption, particularly in the core  South markets.

Your Company also  continued to drive BRU Gold – a premium offering, targeted at  new age consumers of coffee in the non-traditional markets.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) Your Company continues to invest in IT, leveraging it as a source  of competitive advantage.
The enterprise wide SAP platform, the  backbone of IT, encompasses all core business processes in your  Company.
It also provides a comprehensive data warehouse with  analytical capability that facilitates better and faster decisions.
Your Company has leveraged the SAP platform to aid business  priorities and improve efficiencies both within the Company as well  as by collaborating with suppliers and customers.
Your Company  is also using latest technology offerings like in-memory computing  to significantly improve process efficiencies and unlock time of  employees.
Your Company has institutionalised an extensive IT capability for  Customer Development function to support front-end execution.
All distributors run a standard distributor management system.
The sales representatives and field based sales personnel have  been equipped with mobility devices for effective and efficient   on-ground execution.
The available data is mined using analytical  tools to fine tune the selling process at each and every outlet.
This capability, which has been used for the urban markets has  also been extended to rural markets.
The existing technology  backbone was leveraged to provide for a low cost mobile phone  based solution that significantly saved distribution costs.
Your Company is investing in capabilities that will help reach  out and engage with end consumers, using low cost mobile  technology.
These capabilities will not only increase the number  of consumers that can be reached, especially in rural areas, but  also dramatically change the way in which your Company engages  with them in a personalised manner using mobile telephony  as a medium.
Capabilities that have been built in this area will  help your Company learn more about the end users across  multiple brands as well as communicate with them directly about  customised offers.
IT tools and solutions are being used across the organisation to  make employees more productive and efficient.
Employees have  been equipped with personal computing tools and technologies  that allow them to communicate and collaborate more efficiently  and in a more agile manner.
Your Company continues to invest in IT infrastructure to support  business applications and has leveraged India’s expanded  telecom footprint to provide high bandwidth terrestrial links to all  Directors’ Report Directors’ Report42 43Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 operating units.

12.
FINANCE AND ACCOUNTS Your Company continued to focus on cash generation.
The  focus on managing optimal levels of inventory, sound business  performance, operating efficiencies and cost savings across the  organisation helped generate healthy cash flows.
Your Company  managed investments prudently by deploying cash surplus in a  balanced portfolio defined to offer primacy to safety and liquidity  of the investments.
The finance function of the Company took a significant  step forward by consolidating the work done on Finance  Transformation last year to further build capabilities and to get  the business future ready.
Your Company’s success depends  upon being able to decouple transaction volume growth from  business growth and thereby reduce the cost, complexity and  time of transaction processing.
The key building blocks to the  transformation programme were Procure to Pay, Zero Based  Controls, Record to Report Transformation and My Business  Information Projects.
Procure to Pay project aimed to move the needle on services to  suppliers from vendor satisfaction to vendor delight.
This year,  your Company standardised and centralised invoice processing,  query management and payments processing from more than 40  locations to one payment excellence centre, thereby delighting  business partners.
The programme also delivers a capability  to steer continuous improvement programmes from the global  centre of excellence in Bengaluru, thereby landing a six sigma  level efficiency in transactional processes.
Zero Based Controls project completely revamped the traditional  control monitoring methods to a cutting edge automated  cockpit flagging exceptions to the control environment.
This  enables exception based monitoring, while tightening the cost  of control.
This year, your Company standardised the financial  controls across geographies, leveraged technology to automate  more than half of the key controls and set up a leading edge  monitoring and reporting capability in Bengaluru.
This now  enables a focused review of the risk areas and a constructive  effort to remediate the exceptions, if any.
Record to Report Transformation project aims at creating one  financial reporting excellence centre at Bengaluru.
Your Company  has already taken the first step in this journey.
Your Company is  confident of making significant progress in the times to come,  thereby future proofing the organisation.
This project will enable  faster reporting and accelerate results release to the market.
My Business Information initiative is a stepping stone to the next  generation information analytics.
This goes with the principle of  converting data into information and information into insights  seamlessly, at a click, to expedite business decision making.
This year, your Company took a giant leap of moving from a  multitude of ad hoc reports at multiple places to one centralised  information repository, thereby ensuring one version of a report.
In parallel, your Company achieved standardisation of reports  and over 90% reduction in the number of reports.
This means  fewer and better quality reports and more time released for  investment on value added analysis.
Such information on-the-go  makes business partnering more effective, simpler and a richer  role for finance, while providing relevant information for speedy  business decision making.
Your Company continued with various simplification initiatives  commenced last year by disproportionately investing in IT.
This  has resulted in release of time occupied by non-value adding  tasks while giving significant savings in audit efforts.
While driving the transformation agenda, your Company’s  finance team also continued to focus on delivering excellence  on Financial Accounting and Reporting.
This year, your Company  won the esteemed ‘Silver Shield’ from the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India for excellence in financial reporting for the  Annual Report 2012-13.
Your Company is committed to increase  the efficiency and effectiveness of the finance function in general  and core areas of accounting, reporting and controls in particular.

OUTLOOK Global economic indicators are expected to improve, led by positive  prospects in advanced economies.
Despite a strengthening  external demand, uncertainty continues to loom large on the  economic horizon of some emerging economies owing to  domestic fragilities.
The global economic climate continues to be  volatile, uncertain and prone to geo-political risks.
For India, economic activity is expected to improve modestly,  driven by global economic revival and moderation in inflation.
Upside pressures on inflation and consumption, hinge on the  vagaries of the monsoon and the pace of revival of the investment  climate will determine to a very large extent India’s economic  performance, going forward.
FMCG markets are expected to grow; however, uncertain global  economic environment, inflation and competitive intensity continue  to pose challenges.
While the near term conditions pose a challenge  for the economy, the medium to longer term secular trends based  on rising incomes, aspirations, low consumption levels, etc.
are  positive and an opportunity for the FMCG sector, in general and for  your Company, in particular.

At Hindustan Unilever, we feel proud  to belong to a Company whose visionary founders laid the  foundation stone for good governance long back and made it an  integral principle of the business, as demonstrated in the words  above.

Alternative Dispute Redressal Shareholders Long pending litigations involve significant investment as  monetary value of the disputed shares and accrued dividends /  other benefits are locked up unutilised till the dispute is settled.
Further, in terms of the requirements of the Companies Act, 1956,  such dividends / other specified incomes remaining unclaimed  / unpaid for a period of seven years are to be credited to the  Investor Education and Protection Fund and the Shareholders  are not entitled to claim the same thereafter.
Keeping the above in mind, the Company in 2004, pioneered  the mechanism of providing an alternate dispute redressal for  Shareholders to resolve the shares related disputes pending  before the courts / authorities by amicable settlement.
The  Company had started this unique initiative of organising  Alternative Dispute Redressal meetings wherein aggrieved  investors come face to face and get a chance to settle their  disputes, some of which were pending for years.
The first of such meeting was held in Ahmedabad in 2005  wherein 14 cases were resolved by amicable settlement.
Similar  such meetings were held in other cities like Mumbai and Kolkata  wherein 31 more cases were resolved to the satisfaction of the  parties to the dispute.
The Company engaged the services of  retired Judges to preside over the meeting in order to give a fair  view to each case.
A number of Shareholders have availed the benefit of this  process and the Company through its various initiatives keeps  exploring the possibilities of settling such issues.
The process  helps the investors in releasing the locked up investment and  save their time consumed in contesting legal proceedings.
The  objective of this process is to facilitate quick resolution of the  dispute between the parties.
The Shareholders who are willing to avail the benefits of  Alternative Dispute Redressal mechanism may approach the  Investor Service Department of the Company at the Registered  Office of the Company.
Consumers / Customers In line with one of the Company’s key tenets of Consumer and  Customer Centricity, the Company commenced a process of  resolving consumer and customer disputes and grievances  through an alternative disputes redressal mechanism.
The Company appointed four retired Judges of different High  Courts, one in each region, to act as Ombudsman to hear the  Company’s consumers and customers in a bid to resolve long  pending disputes.
The Ombudsman independently reviews the  merits of the complaint and decides on the issue.
The Company  has taken the view that the decision arrived at such disputes  Corporate Governance Corporate Governance70 71Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports resolution meetings, while being fully binding on the Company, may  not be binding on its consumers and customers and if they choose  to continue with litigation, they are free to do so.
These meetings  were held in all the four regions and achieved reasonable success.
The Company believes that such independent dispute resolution  mechanism will further reinforce its commitment and credibility  with its consumers and also set new benchmarks for the industry.
The Company has also set a consumer care helpline ‘Levercare’,  to help consumers reach the Company for their grievances,  suggestions, ideas and to help brands reach out to consumers.

The  amount capitalised comprises expenditure that can be directly  attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to  creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended  use.
Fixed assets utilised for research and development are  capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the policies  stated for Tangible Assets.
2.4.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible asset are  added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits  from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard  of performance.
Items of tangible assets that have been retired from active use and  are held for disposal are stated at the lower of their net book value  and net realisable value and are shown separately in the financial  statements under “Other current assets”.
Any expected loss is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses  arising from disposal of tangible assets which are carried at cost  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight line  method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or at the  Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2014  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) Standalone 81 Annual Report 2013-14 rates prescribed under Schedule XIV to the Companies Act, 1956,  whichever is higher.
Accordingly, -  computers and related assets, included in office equipment  are depreciated over four years; -  leasehold land is amortised over the primary period of the  lease; -  certain assets of the cold chain, included in plant and  equipment, are depreciated over four/ seven years; and - vehicles are depreciated over six years.
2.5.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis as  per rates mentioned below: Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/ trademarks 25% Computer software 20% 2.6.
Impairment Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date  as to whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible  and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose of assessing  impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups  of assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
If any such  indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the  individual asset/ cash generating unit is made.
Assets whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount  are written down to the recoverable amount by recognising  the impairment loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s or cash  generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use.
Value in  use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected  to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal  at the end of its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each  Balance Sheet date as to whether there is any indication that  an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting  periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7.
Investments Investments are classified into current and non-current  investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower of cost  and fair value.
Non-current investments are stated at cost.
A provision for diminution is made to recognise a decline, other  than temporary, in the value of non-current investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be  held for not more than one year from the date on which such  investments are made, are classified as “Current investments”.
All other investments are classified as “Non-current  investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to be  occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of the  company, have been classified as investment property.
Investment  properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation on the  building component of the investment property is provided in line  with the policy on tangible assets.
2.8.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average basis.
The net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Finished goods  and work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion  costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition.
2.9.
Trade receivables and Loans and advances Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.
2.10.
Provisions and Contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  balance sheet date and are not discounted to its present value.
These are reviewed at each year end date and adjusted to reflect  the best current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible  obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will  be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of  the company or a present obligation that arises from past events  where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made.

Retirement/ post retirement benefits Defined contribution plans Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as  employees’ state insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation  scheme, employee pension scheme etc.
are charged as an  expense based on the amount of contribution required to be  made as and when services are rendered by the employees.
Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect of certain  employees, is made to a government administered fund and  charged as an expense to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The  above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution Schemes  as the company has no further defined obligations beyond the  monthly contributions.
Defined benefit plans In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are  made to a trust administered by the company.
The interest rate  payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the  statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by  the Company.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest  earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Company also provides for retirement/ post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect  of certain employees), compensated absences and medical.
The Company’s liability towards such defined benefit plans is  determined based on valuations, as at the balance sheet date,  made by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit  method.
Actuarial gains and losses in respect of the defined  benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the year in which they arise.
The classification of the  company’s net obligation into current and non- current is as per  the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring, are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when: a) the  company has a present obligation as a result of past event; b) a  reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation;  and c) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
2.12.
Income Taxes Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the applicable tax  rates and tax laws.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences, subject  to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred tax  assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using  the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are  recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there is a  reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be  available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
In situations where the Company has unabsorbed depreciation or  carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax assets are recognised only  if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that  they can be realised against future taxable profits.
The carrying  amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet  date for any write down or reversal, as considered appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when  there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the  liability on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to  set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
2.13.
Foreign currency translations Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange  rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Forward exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end  on account of firm commitment transactions are marked to  market and the losses, if any are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss, and gains are ignored in accordance with the  announcement of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  on ‘Accounting for Derivatives’ issued in March 2008.
2.14.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of  ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating  leases.
The company is both a lessee and a lessor under such  arrangements.
Payments and receipts under such leases are  charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  straight line basis over the primary period of the lease.
2.15.

(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) Standalone 83 Annual Report 2013-14 a)  Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based on  the transaction price agreed to between segments which is  primarily market based.
b)  Revenue and expenses have been identified to segments on  the basis of their relationship to the operating activities of  the segment.
Revenue and expenses, which relate to the  company as a whole and are not allocable to segments on a  reasonable basis, have been included under “Un-allocated  corporate expenses net of un-allocated income”.
2.16.
Cash and cash equivalents In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include  cash in hand, term deposits with banks and other short-term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  months or less.
2.17.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
The weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods presented  is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding  change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted  earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to  equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares  outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all  dilutive potential equity shares.
2.18.
Employee share based payments Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for under  the intrinsic value method as per the accounting treatment  prescribed by Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee  Stock Purchase Guidelines, 1999, issued by Securities and  Exchange Board of India and the Guidance Note on Employee  Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
2.19.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  the generally accepted accounting principles requires that the  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of  contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the  reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

For Lovelock & Lewes Firm Registration Number: 301056E Chartered Accountants Pradip Kanakia Partner Mumbai: April 28, 2014 Membership Number: 39985 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports Standalone 127 Annual Report 2013-14 Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION : ECONOMIC VALUE ADDED (EVA) What is EVA?
Traditional approaches to measuring ‘Shareholder’s Value  Creation‘have used parameters such as earnings capitalisation,  market capitalisation and present value of estimated future cash  flows.
Extensive equity research has established that it is not  earnings per se, but VALUE that is important.
A measure called  ‘Economic Value Added’ (EVA) is increasingly being applied to  understand and evaluate financial performance.
* EVA = Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) – Cost of  Capital Employed (COCE), where, NOPAT = Profits after depreciation and taxes but before interest  costs.
NOPAT thus represents the total pool of profits available  on an ungeared basis to provide a return to lenders and  shareholders, and COCE = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) x Average  Capital Employed * Cost of debt is taken at the effective rate of interest applicable  to an “AAA” rated company like HUL for a short term debt, net  of taxes.
We have considered a pre tax rate of 9.63% for 2013-14  (9.13% for 2012-13).
* Cost of Equity is the return expected by the investors to  compensate them for the variability in returns caused by  fluctuating earnings and share prices.
Cost of Equity = Risk free return equivalent to yield on long term  Government Bonds (taken at 8.80% for 2013-14) + Market risk premium (taken at 3.98%) (x) Beta variant for the  Company, (taken at 0.709) where Beta is a relative measure of  risk associated with the Company’s shares as against the market  as a whole.
Thus HUL ’s cost of equity = 8.80% + 3.98% (x) 0.709 = 11.62% What does EVA show?
EVA is residual income after charging the Company for the cost  of capital provided by lenders and shareholders.
It represents  the value added to the shareholders by generating operating  profits in excess of the cost of capital employed in the business.
When will EVA increase?
EVA will increase if: a.
Operating profits can be made to grow without employing  more capital, i.e.
greater efficiency.
b.
Additional capital is invested in projects that return more  than the cost of obtaining new capital, i.e.
profitable growth.
c.  Capital is curtailed in activities that do not cover the cost of  capital, i.e.
liquidate unproductive capital.
EVA in practice at Hindustan Unilever Limited.
In Hindustan Unilever Limited, the goal of sustainable long term  value creation for our shareholders is well understood by all the  business groups.
Measures to evaluate business performance  and to set targets take into account this concept of value creation.

(All amounts in Rs.

Basis of preparation        These consolidated financial statements have been prepared  to comply in all material aspects with applicable accounting  principles in India, the applicable Accounting Standards notified  under Section 211(3C) of the Companies Act, 1956.
Pursuant to  Circular 15/ 2013 dated 13th September, 2013 read with circular  08/ 2014 dated 4th April, 2014, till the standards of Accounting  or any addendum thereto are prescribed by Central Government  in consultation and recommendation of the National Financial  Reporting Authority, the existing Accounting Standards notified  under Section 211(3C) [Companies (Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2006, as amended] and in particular Accounting Standard  21 (AS 21) - ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and Accounting  Standard 27 (AS 27) - ‘Financial Reporting of Interest in Joint  Venture’.
The financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries,  controlled trust and the joint venture (on a proportionate basis)  have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together  the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and  expenses.
Intra group balances and intra group transactions and  resulting unrealised profits are eliminated in full.
Unrealised  losses resulting from intra group transactions are also  eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using  uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other  events in similar circumstances.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non- current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other criteria  set out in the Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956.
Based on the nature of products and the time between acquisition  of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash  equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 12  months for the purpose of current/ non-current classification of  assets and liabilities.
Transactions and balances with values below the rounding off  norm adopted by the Group have been reflected as “0.00” in the  relevant notes in these consolidated financial statements.
2.2.
Revenue recognition Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant  risks and rewards of ownership in the goods are transferred to  the buyer as per the terms of the contract, the Group retains  no effective control of the goods transferred to a degree usually  associated with ownership and no significant uncertainty exists  regarding the amount of the consideration that will be derived  from the sale of goods.
Sales are recognised net of trade  discounts, rebates, sales taxes and excise duties (on goods  manufactured and outsourced).
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and  premium on sale of import licences, and lease license fee are  recognised on accrual basis.
Income from Property Development Activity is recognised in  terms of arrangements with developers, where applicable.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on  agreements/ arrangements with the customers as the service  is performed using the proportionate completion method when  no significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of the  consideration that will be derived from rendering the service and  is recognised net of service tax, as applicable.
Interest on investments is recognised on a time proportion basis  taking into account the amounts invested and the rate of interest.
Dividend income on investments is recognised when the right to  receive dividend is established.
2.3.
Expenditure        Expenses are accounted on accrual basis.
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged to the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Development costs of products  are also charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless  a product’s technical feasibility and other criteria set out in  paragraph 44 of AS 26 – ‘Intangible assets’ have been established,  in which case such expenditure is capitalised.
The amount  capitalised comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed  or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating,  producing and making the asset ready for its intended use.
Fixed  assets utilised for research and development are capitalised and  depreciated in accordance with the policies stated for Tangible  Assets.
2.4.
Tangible assets        Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost,  net of accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible asset are  added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits  from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard  of performance.
Items of tangible assets that have been retired from active use and  are held for disposal are stated at the lower of their net book value  and net realisable value and are shown separately in the financial  statements under “Other current assets”.
Any expected loss is  recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Consolidated Consolidated134 135Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2014  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses  arising from disposal of tangible assets which are carried at cost  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight line  method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or at the  rates prescribed under Schedule XIV to the Companies Act, 1956,  whichever is higher.
Accordingly, - computers and related assets, included in office equipment  are depreciated over four years; - leasehold land is amortised over the primary period of the  lease;       -  certain assets of the cold chain, included in plant and  equipment, are depreciated over four/ seven years;  -   vehicles are depreciated over six years; and  - certain assets lying at salons and training centre, included  in plant and equipment, furniture and fixtures and office  equipment, are depreciated over five to nine years.
2.5.
Intangible assets        Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses,  if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on the straight line basis  as per rates mentioned below: Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/ trademarks 25% Computer software 20% 2.6.
Impairment        Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date  as to whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible  and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose of assessing  impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups  of assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
If any such  indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the  individual asset/ cash generating unit is made.
Assets whose  carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount are written down  to the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment loss  as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Recoverable  amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s net  selling price  and its value in use.
Value in use is the present  value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the  continuing use of an asset and from its disposal  at the end of  its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet  date as to whether there is any indication that an impairment  loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods may no  longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7.
Investments        Investments are classified into current and non-current  investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower of cost  and fair value.
Non-current investments are stated at cost.
A  provision for diminution is made to recognise a decline, other  than temporary, in the value of non-current investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be  held for not more than one year from the date on which such  investments are made, are classified as “Current investments”.
All  other investments are classified as “Non-current investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to be  occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of the  company, have been classified as investment property.
Investment  properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation on the  building component of the investment property is provided in line  with the policy on tangible assets.
2.8.
Interests in Joint Ventures       Interests in Jointly controlled entities (incorporated Joint  Venture) are accounted for using proportionate consolidation  method.
2.9.
Inventories        Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average basis.
The net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Finished goods  and work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion  costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their  present location and condition.
2.10.
Trade receivables and Loans and Advances Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.
2.11.
Provisions and Contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a  result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the amount of the  obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the  balance sheet date and are not discounted to its present value.
These are reviewed at each year end date and adjusted to reflect  the best current estimate.
Overview Financial Statements Shareholder InformationReports Consolidated Consolidated134 135Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2014  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible  obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will  be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one  or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of  the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events  where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made.
2.12.
Retirement / Post Retirement Benefits Defined contribution plans         Contributions to defined contribution schemes such as  employees’ state insurance, labour welfare fund, superannuation  scheme, employee pension scheme etc.
are charged as an  expense based on the amount of contribution required to be made  as and when services are rendered by the employees.
Group’s  provident fund contribution, in respect of certain Schemes as  the group has no further defined obligations beyond the monthly  contributions.
Defined benefit plans In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions  are made to a trust administered by the Group.
The interest rate  payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the  statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good  by the Group.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest  earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Group also provides for retirement/ post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect  of certain employees), compensated absences and medical.
The  Group’s liability towards such defined benefit plans is determined  based on valuations, as at the balance sheet date, made by  independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses in respect of the defined benefit plans  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in  which they  arise.
The classification of the Group’s net obligation  into current and non- current is as per the actuarial valuation  report.
Termination benefits Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring, are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when: a) the  Group has a present obligation as a result of past event;  b) a  reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation;  and c) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
2.13.
Income Taxes Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the applicable tax  rates.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences, subject  to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred tax  assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using  the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively  enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are  recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there is a  reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be  available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.
In situations where the Group has unabsorbed depreciation or  carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax assets are recognised  only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence  that they can be realised against future taxable profits.
The  carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each  balance sheet date for any write down or reversal, as considered  appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there  is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts  and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability  on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off  assets against liabilities representing current tax and where the  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on  income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
2.14.
Foreign currency translations  Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange  rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Forward exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end  on account of firm commitment transactions are marked to  market and the losses, if any are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss and gains are ignored in accordance with the  Announcement of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  on ‘Accounting for Derivatives’ issued in March 2008.
2.15.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of  ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating  leases.
The Group is both a lessee and a lessor under such  Consolidated Consolidated136 137Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2013-14 NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2014  (Contd.)
(All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) arrangements.
Payments and receipts under such leases are  charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  straight line basis over the primary period of the lease.
2.16.
Segment reporting        The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are in  conformity with the accounting policies adopted for the Group.
Further, a) Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based on  the transaction price agreed to between segments which is  primarily market based.
b) Revenue and expenses have been identified to segments on  the basis of their relationship to the operating activities of  the segment.
Revenue and expenses, which relate to the  Group as a whole and are not allocable to segments on a  reasonable basis, have been included under “Un-allocated  corporate expenses net of un-allocated income”.
2.17.
Cash and cash equivalents In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include  cash in hand, term deposits with banks and other short-term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  months or less.
2.18.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
The weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods presented  is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding  change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted  earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to  equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares  outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all  dilutive potential equity shares.
2.19.
Employee share based payments  Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for under  the intrinsic value method as per the accounting treatment  prescribed by Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee  Stock Purchase Guidelines, 1999, issued by the Securities and  Exchange Board of India and the Guidance Note on Employee  Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
2.20.
Use of estimates        The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  the generally accepted accounting principles requires that the  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of  contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the  reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Company’s Management is responsible for the  preparation of these consolidated financial statements that  give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position,  consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash  flows of the Group in accordance with accounting principles  generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes  the design, implementation and maintenance of internal  control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair  view and are free from material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing and other applicable authoritative pronouncements  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated  financial statements are free from material misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the  consolidated financial statements.
The procedures  selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including  the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the  auditors consider internal control relevant to the Company’s  preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated  financial statements in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the  purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  group’s internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating  the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by  Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation  of the consolidated financial statements.

Consolidation of Multiple Folios Members are requested to consolidate their  shareholdings under multiple folios, to save  themselves from the burden of receiving  multiple communications as also to facilitate  one point tracking of all corporate benefits on  their shares.
PAN Requirement for Transfer  of Shares in Physical Form SEBI has mandated submission of Permanent  Account Number (PAN) for securities market  transactions and off market / private  transactions involving transfer of shares of  listed companies in physical form.
