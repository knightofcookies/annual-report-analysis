In a challenging  external environment, your Company  performed well and delivered another  year of consistent, competitive, profitable  and responsible growth.
With a deep  understanding of consumer insights, your  Company continued to drive innovation  across brands and operations and  adapted the go-to-market strategies,  taking into account the diversity of many  Indias and the evolving channels of  distribution.
Simultaneously, we  recognised the need for responsible  growth and focused on creating greener  and more efficient manufacturing with  cleaner fuels, more efficient energy  consumption and lesser generation of  waste.
We remained committed to our  purpose of making sustainable living  commonplace across the value chain.
In the year under review, we saw  considerable changes in the external  business environment.
While commodity  costs and inflation continued to come  down, the second consecutive monsoon  failure and resulting drought meant a  distressed rural demand scenario in  several parts of the country.
Competition,  both international and local, continued to  be aggressive.
In this scenario, your  Company remained focused on delivering  volume-led profitable growth.
Our Domestic Consumer business grew  by 4% with an impressive 6% underlying  volume growth.
Reported growth was  impacted by phase out of excise benefits  and one-off credits, which had a negative  impact of 110 bps.
Profit before interest  and tax (PBIT) grew by 10% with PBIT  margin improving 90 bps, despite an  the Axe Signature range.
In keeping with  emerging trends in the market, we  relaunched Ayush and have recently  acquired Indulekha hair oil to strengthen  our presence in the ‘naturals’ segment.
Overall, we maintained our strong  position in Personal Products by growing  the core and simultaneously leading the  development of emerging segments like  hair conditioners and colour cosmetics.
Our Foods and Beverages business  delivered another year of strong volume- led growth.
Knorr extended its range with  the launch of Knorr Chef Masalas while  Kissan launched a premium range of  jams and dressings.
Our tea portfolio was  strengthened with the introduction of  some customised products for different  parts of India.
In Ice creams, we continued  to widen the appeal of our core brands  like Cornetto and Magnum with the  launch of Cornetto Mini and Magnum  Choco Brownie.
One of the major strengths of your  Company is the relentless focus on  execution and cost efficiencies.
To  strengthen our presence in the evolving  channels, we created new shopper and  customer programmes in drug stores and  food outlets with a sharp segmentation of  portfolio and shoppers.
We have also  been investing in building world-class  organisational capabilities to lead in the  emerging fast growing e-commerce  channel.
Additionally, our continuous  improvement programmes across the  value chain helped us generate sustained  cost savings that were invested behind  our brands and operations.
We are harnessing technology to build  leading edge operational and marketing  capabilities with initiatives such as  LiveWire - an innovative analytical  platform that taps the potential of Big  Data.
We also launched the People Data  Centre that provides insights into  consumer trends, capturing all  engagements on our brands in the social  media, and enabling real-time  personalised communication with our  consumers.
adverse impact of 50 bps on PBIT, again  as a consequence of the phase out of  excise benefits and one-off credits.
The  consistent improvement in margins was  delivered even as we continued to make  significant investments behind our brands  (A&P was up 160 bps).
Profit after tax but  before exceptional items, PAT (bei), grew  by 6% to Rs.
4,078 crores.
Net Profit was  at Rs.
4,082 crores, with the growth rate  impacted by the higher exceptional  income arising from subsidiary and  property related sales in the previous  year.
The strong track record of cash  generation was sustained with cash from  operations exceeding Rs.
5,000 crores for  yet another year.
The Board of Directors  have proposed a final dividend of Rs.
9.5  per share, subject to the approval of the  shareholders at the AGM.
Together with  the interim dividend of Rs.
6.5 per share,  the total dividend for the financial year  ending 31st March, 2016 amounts to   Rs.
16 per share.
Each of our businesses and functions had  a strong role to play in delivering these  robust results.
In Soaps & Detergents,  due to soft commodity prices, your  Company acted proactively and took  decisive pricing actions resulting in  volumes growing ahead of the market.
We  strengthened our competitive position in  Laundry against both global players as  well as a plethora of local players.
Surf  excel became the largest detergent brand  for your Company, with its iconic  positioning of ‘Daag Achche Hain’  continuing to build brand equity.
Lifebuoy  and Dove delivered strong volume gains  and Lux was relaunched with a  significantly improved mix.
Simultaneously,  we continued to successfully drive market  development of nascent segments like  fabric conditioners, liquid dish-wash and  hand-wash.
Personal Products performance was  powered by renovations across many of   the core brands including Clinic Plus,  Pond’s and Pepsodent, as well as some  exciting new introductions like Lakme Lip  Love, Fair & Lovely BB Cream, Dove  Oxygen Moisture and new fragrances in  CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 1 1 8 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 Most importantly, our brands and  operations continued to be held together  by the firm belief of ‘doing well by doing  good’.
In line with our commitment to  create a more sustainable future, 100% of  the palm oil and tomatoes used in  manufacturing our products, were  sourced sustainably.
In our  manufacturing units, the CO2 emissions  per tonne of production was reduced by  42% and water usage (cubic metre per  tonne of production) reduced by 48%  when compared to the 2008 baseline.
We  have achieved zero non-hazardous waste  to landfill for all our factories and depots.
Our WASH (Water, Sanitation and  Hygiene) initiatives contribute significantly  to the Government’s ‘Clean India Mission’.
To address the challenge of water  shortage in parts of the country,  Hindustan Unilever Foundation continues  to pioneer programs that successfully  created a cumulative water conservation  potential of over 200 billion litres by the  end of 2015.
Hindustan Unilever’s key differentiator is  the quality of talent we attract, retain and  develop.
I am pleased to report that your  Company retained the position of ‘No.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND  ANALYSIS  To avoid duplication between the Directors’ Report and the  Management Discussion and Analysis, we present below a  composite summary of performance of the various businesses  and functions of the Company.
4.
ECONOMY AND MARKETS  The trend of slowdown in global growth continued during  the year.
The below par performance of global economy was  reflected in a continued growth deceleration in most emerging  and developing economies, driven by low commodity prices,  weaker capital inflows and subdued global trade.
Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 30 Directors’ Report and MDA Against this global backdrop, the growth in India stayed fairly  resilient.
India was the fastest growing large economy with a  stable currency that performed better than most other emerging  market currencies.
The domestic macro-economic conditions  also remained stable.
A significant drop in commodity costs led  by crude oil and other interventions resulted in lower consumer  inflation which allowed easing of interest rates in the economy.
However, a second consecutive year of drought and a low  increase in support prices have led to a sharply slower growing  rural economy compared to earlier years.
Consumer spending remained muted and this was reflected  in moderate growth rates across FMCG categories.
Given the  backdrop of a slowing market, a volatile input cost environment  and heightened competitive intensity, the operating environment  for your Company during the year continued to be challenging.
Your Company’s performance for the year 2015-16 has to  be viewed in the context of aforesaid economic and market  environment.

OUTLOOK  The global economic climate continues to be volatile, uncertain  and prone to geo-political risks.
Weak consumer sentiment  and low commodity prices are expected to affect global growth  adversely.
For India, 2016 will be a key year for consolidating its recovery  and accelerating its growth.
Despite challenging global  headwinds, a stable macro performance will help India to  remain an attractive investment destination.
However, execution  of the reforms agenda and commencing the investment cycle  will be key determinants of India’s economic performance on  a long term basis.
While currently inflation is expected to be  benign, upside pressures on inflation exist from the vagaries  of monsoon or due to competitive devaluation of currencies.
Roll out of Goods and Services Tax regime from April 2017 is  a key need of the hour to remove cascading incidence of tax,  simplifying tax compliance environment and enhancing ease of  doing business.
FMCG markets are expected to continue to grow.
Consumer  confidence has increased, however, this has not yet translated  into significant improvement in FMCG market conditions.
While  the near term conditions pose a challenge for FMCG market  growths, the medium to long term secular trends based on  rising incomes, aspirations, low penetration and consumption  levels, are positive for the FMCG sector.
Your Company, with its  brands, talent and investment in capabilities, is well placed to  leverage this opportunity.
20.1 Cautionary Statement  Statements in the Annual Report, particularly those which  relate to Management Discussion and Analysis, describing  the Company’s objectives, projections, estimates and  expectations, may constitute ‘forward looking statements’  within the meaning of applicable laws and regulations.

On behalf of the Board Mumbai, 9th May, 2016 Harish Manwani  Chairman   (DIN : 00045160) 49 Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information Annual Report on Corporate Social Responsibility (Pursuant to Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014) Annexure to the Directors’ Report 1.
Brief outline of the Company’s CSR Policy,  including overview of projects/  programmes  undertaken   Your Company is committed to operate and grow its  business in a socially responsible way and has a simple but  clear purpose – to make sustainable living commonplace.
Your Company believes this is the best long-term way  for our business to grow.
Your Company has embraced  Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) (Link - http:// www.hul.co.in/sustainable-living/) which contributes to  activities listed in the Schedule VII of Section 135 of the  Companies Act, 2013.
The USLP has three global goals  namely (i) help more than a billion people take action  to improve their health and well-being; (ii) halve the  environmental footprint of the making and use of our  products; and (iii) enhance the livelihoods of millions of  people while growing the business.
The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy of the  Company, as approved by the Board of the Directors, is  available on the Company’s website at www.hul.co.in   A brief overview of your Company’s projects is as given below:  Improving Health and Well-Being  •  Handwashing Behaviour Change Programme: Every  year, in India alone, 1.3 million children die before  they reach the age of five, many due to preventable  infections1 .
Handwashing with soap, particularly  after using toilet, can reduce diarrhoeal diseases  by over 40% and respiratory infections by 30% .
Your  Company’s Lifebuoy handwashing programmes  promote the benefits of handwashing with soap at  key times in schools and anganwadis (pre-school  centre).
Since 2010, Lifebuoy has reached over   65 million people in India with its behaviour change  programme, which through a combination of comics,  songs, games and rewards, encourages children to  sustain good hand washing behaviours.
In 2015, your  Company scaled up the partnership in Bihar with  Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and  the Government of Bihar to promote handwashing  behaviour change among children in Bihar with the  aim to help prevent childhood illnesses and mortality.
By 2018, 45 million people are expected to benefit  through this programme.
•  Safe Drinking Water: The lack of safe drinking water is  a major public health issue, particularly in developing  countries like India.
Our Pureit water purifiers have  been working towards making safe water accessible  & affordable for millions.
Globally, so far, Pureit  has cumulatively provided 78 billion litres of safe   drinking water.
Pureit’s most affordable range of purifiers provide  safe drinking water at a running cost of just 30 paisa,  per litre, without the hassles of boiling, without the  need of electricity or continuous tap water supply.
In  India, Pureit has provided over 70 billion litres of safe  drinking water till date.
Your Company has  also been partnering with existing  micro-finance institutions (MFIs) to make water  purifiers more accessible for people at the bottom of  the pyramid.
In 2015, Pureit partnerships extended  their footprint to new geographies such as Punjab and  continued to provide safe drinking water to low income  households in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
•  Domex Toilet Academy (DTA): The World Bank  has estimated that poor sanitation costs India   $53.8 billion a year – equivalent to 6.4 per cent of  the country’s GDP.
It is clearly evident that access  to sanitation is extremely important for the social,  physical and economic well-being of our society.
Domex Toilet Academy is HUL ’s market-based,  entrepreneurial model that provides people access to  sanitation in rural communities.
In partnership with  the social enterprise eKutir and NGO - Population  Services International (PSI), the DTA programme  trains entrepreneurs and masons to supply, install  and maintain toilets for local households; builds  supply chains for sanitation hardware; provides  access to micro-financing and creates demand for  sanitation in underserved communities.
The objective  is to reduce the incidence of open defecation and  improve proper sanitation thereby promoting the  adoption of healthy, hygienic habits.
Till date, DTA has trained 255 micro-entrepreneurs.
DTA has helped build over 30,000 toilets in Indian  households as reported by our partners PSI and  eKutir.
This has benefited and estimated 1,60,000  people in four states - Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh,  Odisha and Bihar.
•  Swachh Aadat Swachh Bharat: HUL launched  ‘Swachh Aadat, Swachh Bharat’ programme in line  with Government of India’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan  (Clean India Mission) to promote good health and  hygiene practices.
Given the scale of challenges  that India faces in the areas of water, sanitation and  hygiene (WASH), this programme is an effort to help  India realise the goals of Clean India Mission by 2019.
This programme promotes good health and hygiene  practice by stressing the need to adopt three simple  good habits (‘Swachh Aadat’) – washing hands five  1  ‘Levels & Trends in Child Mortality’ (2014), UNICEF.
Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 50 Directors’ Report and MDA times a day, using a toilet for defecation and adopting  safe drinking water practices.
The Swachh Aadat, Swachh Bharat programme has  three key thrusts: An on-ground behaviour change  model, a mass media campaign to drive engagement  and awareness and mobile education on health and  hygiene led by our factory workers.
•  Swachh Basti - on-ground behaviour change  model: In 2015, your Company has piloted a  behaviour change model in the slums of Mumbai  and Delhi.
The programme was undertaken with  the support of Municipal Corporations to reach  out to students in Municipal Schools where a  four-week behaviour change programme was  conducted through engaging activities like skits,  demos and jingles.
This programme covered  mothers and other stakeholders in the local  community such as doctors and support groups  to create awareness and develop champions  within schools and the community.
Till date,  2,00,000 people have been reached through  multiple engagement points (school contact  programme, home to home programme and  neonatal programme).
•  ‘Swachh Aadat’ mass media campaign: A mass  media campaign was launched to promote  awareness across the country, which reached  out to 75 million people across India.
Through  this “Haath, Munh Aur Bum” campaign, children  turn into agents of change and propagate the  adoption of three ‘Swachh Aadat (clean habits)’.
Till date, the campaign has received more than  20 million views on YouTube.
The campaign video  can be viewed at https://www.hul.co.in/news/ press-releases/2015/15-12-04-hul-launches- swachh-aadat-swachh-bharat-programme-in- india.html?criteria=year%3d2015    •  Swachhata Doot (Messenger of Cleanliness):  This is a mobile-led rural behaviour change  communication model wherein the employees  at the factories workers become agents of  behaviour change in their villages by sharing  two-minute audio stories on clean habits  through their mobile phones.
They reach out  to school children, parents and community  members thereby positively impacting rural  communities.
Your Company has successfully  completed a pilot that has reached 100,000  people.
•  Asha Daan: Asha Daan is a home in Mumbai for  abandoned, challenged children, the HIV-positive  and the destitute.
Since the inception of Asha Daan  in 1976, your Company has been looking after the  maintenance of the premises.
Your Company takes  care of over 400 infants, destitute men and women  and HIV-positive patients at Asha Daan.
•  Sanjivani: Your Company runs a free mobile medical  service camp ‘Sanjivani’ near Doom Dooma Factory  in Assam.
The aim is to provide free mobile medical  facility in the interior villages of Assam.

The vans are  equipped with basic kits such as diagnostic kit, blood  pressure measuring unit, medicines and a mobile  stretcher.
More than 2,95,000 patients have been  treated in these service camps since its inception in  2003.
In 2015 alone, over 20,000 patients were treated  in the service camps.
Reducing Environmental Impact  •  Water Conservation Projects: According to  estimates, by 2030 the supply of water in India will  be half its demand.
To understand and partake  in meeting this challenge, your Company set up  Hindustan Unilever Foundation (HUF) in 2010, a not  for profit company that anchors various community  development initiatives of Hindustan Unilever  Limited.
HUF supports national priorities for socio- economic development, through its ‘Water for  Public Good’ programme with the specific mandate  to contribute to the water discourse and practice  through a partnered approach.
The key thrust of this organisation is water for public  good with focus on farm livelihoods.
It supports people  centred, micro-level solutions to the challenges being  faced by the water sector and uses the knowledge  thus gained to shape the debate on water.
Recognising  that more than half of India’s agriculture lacks any  kind of irrigation facilities and that agriculture is the  major consumer of water, HUF has been focusing on  improving agriculture’s water efficiency.
So far, HUF has initiated projects across 54 districts  in 9 States and 2 Union Territories located across 11  river basins in India.
Water conservation programmes  undertaken by HUF, through collective action and in  partnership with several NGOs, communities, other  co-funders and partners across India, have helped  in the creation of cumulative water conservation  potential of 200 billion litres.
51 Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information  •  Solidaridad - Sustainability (Tea Procurement):  Your Company has a clear roadmap to achieve the  bold commitment to source 100% of agricultural raw  materials sustainably by 2020.
Sustainable agriculture  means growing food in ways which sustain the soil,  minimise water and fertiliser use, protect biodiversity  and enhance farmers’ livelihoods.
The Company  will ensure that the agricultural raw materials that  are used such as tea, fruits and vegetables are  sustainably sourced.
The programme aims to move  the Indian tea industry producers into adopting a  sustainability code which shall promote sustainable  agricultural practices, improve productivity and  reduce costs ensuring future security of tea supply  in India and also protect the ecosystems (soil, water  and bio-diversity) whilst improving the quality of life  for producers and workers.
Enhancing Livelihoods  •  Project Shakti: Project Shakti is an initiative to  financially empower rural women and create  livelihood opportunities for them.
It provides a  regular income stream for the Shakti entrepreneurs  and their families.
Your Company has trained  thousands of Shakti Ammas across the villages in a  bid to develop an entrepreneurial mind-set and make  them financially independent and more empowered.
Project Shakti has empowered nearly 70,000 Shakti  Ammas complemented by 48,000 Shaktimaans.
Shaktimaans are typically the husbands or brothers  of the Shakti Ammas.
They sell products on bicycles  in surrounding villages, covering a larger area than  Shakti Ammas can cover on foot.
•  Fair and Lovely Foundation: The Foundation identifies  academically exceptional girls from financially  challenged backgrounds and offers scholarships to  the deserving candidates.
To maintain integrity and  fairness, the selection is done by a panel of eminent  personalities from diverse fields.

Till date, 1,200 girl  students have been awarded scholarships.

Alternative Dispute Redressal Shareholders Long pending litigations involve significant investment as  monetary value of the disputed shares and accrued dividends /  other benefits are locked up unutilised till the dispute is settled.
Further, in terms of the requirements of the Companies Act,  1956, such dividends / other specified incomes remaining  unclaimed / unpaid for a period of seven years are to be  Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information 81 credited to the Investor Education and Protection Fund and the  Shareholders are not entitled to claim the same thereafter.
Keeping the above in mind, the Company in 2004, pioneered  the mechanism of providing an alternate dispute redressal for  Shareholders to resolve the shares related disputes pending  before the courts / authorities by amicable settlement.
The  Company had started this unique initiative of organising  Alternative Dispute Redressal meetings wherein aggrieved  investors come face to face and get a chance to settle their  disputes, some of which were pending for years.
A number of Shareholders have availed the benefit of this  process and the Company through its various initiatives keeps  exploring the possibilities of settling such issues.
The process  helps the investors in releasing the locked up investment and  save their time consumed in contesting legal proceedings.
The  objective of this process is to facilitate quick resolution of the  dispute between the parties.
The Shareholders who are willing to avail the benefits of  Alternative Dispute Redressal mechanism may approach the  Investor Service Department of the Company at the Registered  Office of the Company.
Consumers / Customers In line with one of the Company’s key tenets of Consumer and  Customer Centricity, the Company commenced a process of  resolving consumer and customer disputes and grievances  through an alternative disputes redressal mechanism.
The  Company appointed four retired Judges of different High  Courts, one in each region, to act as Ombudsman to hear the  Company’s consumers and customers in a bid to resolve long  pending disputes.
The Ombudsman independently reviews  the merits of the complaint and decides on the issue.
The  Company has taken the view that the decision arrived at such  disputes resolution meetings, while being fully binding on the  Company, may not be binding on its consumers and customers  and if they choose to continue with litigation, they are free to  do so.
These meetings were held in all the four regions and  achieved reasonable success.
The Company believes that  such independent dispute resolution mechanism will further  reinforce its commitment and credibility with its consumers  and also set new benchmarks for the industry.
The Company has also set a consumer care helpline ‘Levercare’,  to help consumers reach the Company for their grievances,  suggestions, ideas and to help brands reach out to consumers.

For S. N. ANANTHASUBRAMANIAN & CO. S. N. ANANTHASUBRAMANIAN FCS: 4206 C.P No: 1774 Thane: 9th May, 2016 Note: This report should be read with the letter of even date  by the Secretarial Auditors, which is available on the website  of the Company www.hul.co.in Corporate Governance Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 86 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION : ECONOMIC  VALUE ADDED (EVA) What is EVA ?
Traditional approaches to measuring Shareholder’s Value  Creation’ have used parameters such as earnings capitalisation,  market capitalisation and present value of estimated future  cash flows.
Extensive equity research has established that it is  not earnings per se, but VALUE that is important.
A measure  called ‘Economic Value Added’ (EVA) is increasingly being  applied to understand and evaluate financial performance *EVA = Net Operating Profit after Taxes (NOPAT) - Cost of  Capital Employed (COCE), where, NOPAT = Profits after depreciation and taxes but before interest  costs.
NOPAT thus represents the total pool of profits available  on an ungeared basis to provide a return to lenders and  shareholders, and  COCE = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) x Average  Capital Employed *Cost of debt is taken at the effective rate of interest applicable  to an “AAA” rated Company like HUL for a short term debt, net  of taxes.
We have considered a pre tax rate of 8.22% for 2015-16  (8.42% for 2014-15) *Cost of Equity is the return expected by the investors to  compensate them for the variability in returns caused by  fluctuating earnings and share prices.
Cost of Equity = Risk free return equivalent to yield on long term  Government Bonds (taken at 7.47% for 2015-16) + Market risk premium (taken at 6.43%) (x) Beta variant for the  Company, (taken at 0.704) where Beta is a relative measure  of risk associated with the Company’s shares as against the  market as a whole.
Thus HUL ’s cost of equity = 7.47% + 6.43% (x) 0.704 = 11.99% What does EVA show?
EVA is residual income after charging the Company for the cost  of capital provided by lenders and shareholders.
It represents  the value added to the shareholders by generating operating  profits in excess of the cost of capital employed in the business.
When will EVA increase?
EVA will increase if: a.
Operating profits can be made to grow without employing  more capital, i.e.
greater efficiency.
b.
Additional capital’s invested in projects that return more  than the cost of obtaining new capital, I.e.
profitable  growth.
c.  Capital is curtailed in activities that do not cover the cost of  capital, i.e liquidate unproductive capital.
EVA in practice at Hindustan Unilever Limited.
In Hindustan Unilever Limited, the goal of sustainable long  term value creation for our shareholders is well understood  by all the business groups.
Measures to evaluate business  performance and to set targets take into account this concept  of value creation.

Standalone 94 Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS  UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3 OF SECTION  143 OF THE ACT We have audited the internal financial controls over financial  reporting of Hindustan Unilever Limited (“the Company”) as of  31 March, 2016 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone  financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that  date.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL  FINANCIAL CONTROLS The Company’s management is responsible for establishing  and maintaining internal financial controls based on the  internal controls over financial reporting criteria established  by the Company considering the essential components of  internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that  were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient  conduct of its business, including adherence to Company’s  policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and  detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable  financial information, as required under the Companies Act  2013 (“the Act”).
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls over financial reporting based on  our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards  on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under  section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit  of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of  Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the ICAI.
Those  Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal  financial controls over financial reporting was established  and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all  material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and their operating  effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over  financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of  internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing  the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal  controls based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the  Company’s internal financial control system over financial  reporting.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING A company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  financial statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal  financial controls over financial reporting includes those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements.
(Referred to in our report of even date) ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT   AUDITOR’S REPORT - 31 st  MARCH, 2016 95 Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL  CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be  detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls over financial reporting to future periods  are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls over  financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes  in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies  or procedures may deteriorate.
OPINION In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  an adequate internal financial control system over financial  reporting and such internal financial controls over financial  reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2016,  based on the internal controls over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by ICAI.

Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line  basis as per rates mentioned below: Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/ trademarks 25% Computer software 20% 2.6.
Impairment Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet date  as to whether there is any indication that an asset (tangible  and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose of assessing  impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that  generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely  independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups  of assets is considered as a cash generating unit.
If any such  indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the  individual asset/cash generating unit is made.
Assets whose  carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount are written  down to the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment  loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s or cash generating  unit’s net selling price and its value in use.
Value in use is the  present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise  from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at  the end of its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each  Balance Sheet date as to whether there is any indication that  an impairment loss recognised for an asset in prior accounting  periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7.
Investments Investments are classified into current and long term investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower of cost and fair  value.
Long-term investments are stated at cost.
A provision for  diminution is made to recognise a decline, other than temporary,  separately for each individual long term investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be  held for not more than one year from the date on which such  investments are made, are classified as “Current investments”.
All other investments are classified as “Long-term investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to be  occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations of  the Company, have been classified as investment property.
Investment properties are carried at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation on the building component of the investment  property is provided in line with the policy on tangible assets.
2.8.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable  value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average basis.
The net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary  course of business less the estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Finished goods and  work-in-progress include all costs of purchases, conversion  costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition.
2.9.
Trade receivables and Loans and advances Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.
2.10.
Provisions and Contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation  as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required to  settle the obligation and there is a reliable estimate of the  amount of the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the best  estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present  obligation at the Balance Sheet date and are not discounted to  its present value.
These are reviewed at each year end date and  adjusted to reflect the best current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible  obligation arising from past events, the existence of which  will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the  control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from  past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable  estimate of the amount cannot be made.
2.11.
Retirement/ post retirement benefits Defined contribution plans Contributions to defined contribution schemes such  as employees’ state insurance, labour welfare fund,  superannuation scheme, employee pension scheme etc.
are  charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution  required to be made as and when services are rendered by the  employees.
Company’s provident fund contribution, in respect  of certain employees, is made to a government administered  fund and charged as an expense to the Statement of Profit and  Loss.
The above benefits are classified as Defined Contribution  Schemes as the Company has no further defined obligations  beyond the monthly contributions.
Defined benefit plans In respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are  made to a trust administered by the Company.
The interest rate  payable to the members of the trust shall not be lower than the  to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2016 (Contd.)
NOTES 102 (All amounts in Rs.

NOTES Hindustan Unilever Limited Annual Report 2015-16 Standalone statutory rate of interest declared by the Central Government  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous  Provisions Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by  the Company.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest  earnings of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Company also provides for retirement/post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in respect  of certain employees), compensated absences (in respect of  certain employees) and medical including to the employees  of Indian subsidiaries and a subsidiary of parent company.
The Company’s liability towards such defined benefit plans is  determined based on valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date,  made by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit  method.
Actuarial gains and losses in respect of the defined  benefit plans are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss in the year in which they arise.
The classification of the  Company’s net obligation into current and non- current is as  per the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring, are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when: a)  the Company has a present obligation as a result of past  event; b)  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the  obligation; and c)  it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
2.12.
Income taxes Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and deferred  tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the applicable  tax rates and tax laws.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences,  subject to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred  tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or  substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax  assets are recognised and carried forward only to the extent  that there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future  taxable income will be available against which such deferred  tax assets can be realised.
In situations where the Company  has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward tax losses,  all deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is virtual  certainty supported by convincing evidence that they can be  realised against future taxable profits.
The carrying amount of  deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date for  any write down, as considered appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when  there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised  amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the  liability on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right  to set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate  to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.
2.13.
Foreign currency translations Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange  rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.
Forward exchange contracts outstanding as at the year end  on account of firm commitment transactions are marked to  market and the losses, if any, are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss, and gains are ignored in accordance with  the announcement of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India on ‘Accounting for Derivatives’ issued in March 2008.
2.14.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of  ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating  leases.
The Company is both a lessee and a lessor under such  arrangements.
Payments and receipts under such leases are  charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a  straight line basis over the primary period of the lease.
2.15.
Segment reporting The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are  in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for the  Company.
Further, a)  Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based on  the transaction price agreed to between segments which  is primarily market based.
b)  Revenue and expenses have been identified to segments  on the basis of their relationship to the operating activities  of the segment.
Revenue and expenses, which relate to   the Company as a whole and are not allocable to segments  on a reasonable basis, have been included under “Un- allocated corporate expenses net of un-allocated income”.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the  weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
The weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the period and for all periods presented  is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the  conversion of potential equity shares, that have changed the  number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding  change in resources.
For the purpose of calculating diluted  earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable  to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
2.18.
Employee share based payments Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for under  the intrinsic value method as per the accounting treatment  prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share  Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014, issued by  Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Guidance Note  on Employee Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India.
2.19.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with  the generally accepted accounting principles requires that the  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of  contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during  the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those  estimates.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR  INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS The respective Board of Directors of the of the Holding  Company, its subsidiary companies and jointly controlled  entity incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing  and maintaining internal financial controls based on the  internal controls over financial reporting criteria established  by the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and jointly  controlled entity incorporated in India considering the essential  components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the  respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under  the Act.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding  Company’s, its subsidiary company’s and jointly controlled  entity’s incorporated in India, internal financial controls over  financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit  in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance  Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing, issued  by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of  the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting  was established and maintained and if such controls operated  effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing  procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the  internal financial controls system over financial reporting and  their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a  material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the  design and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the  auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and audit  evidence obtained by other auditor in terms of their report  referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Holding Company’s, its subsidiary company’s and jointly  controlled entity’s incorporated in India, internal financial  controls system over financial reporting.
MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL  CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING A company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting  is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of  financial statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal  financial controls over financial reporting includes those  policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made  only in accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements.

NOTES to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2016 NOTES The Company holds investments in the below entities which by share ownership are deemed to be an associate company: i)  Comfund Consulting Limited (formerly known as Comfund Financial Services India Limited) where the Company has 24% equity  holding.
This is a NBFC set up between HUL and a partner company, currently dormant.
ii)  Aquagel Chemicals Bhavnagar Private Limited where the Company has 26% equity and 26% preference capital holding.
This is  a Company engaged in Silica business.
However the Company does not exercise significant influence in any of the above entities, as demonstrated below : i) The Company does not have any representation on the board of directors or corresponding governing body of the investee.
ii) The Company does not participate in policy making process.
iii) The Company does not have any material transactions with the investee.
iv) The Company does not interchange any managerial personnel.
v) The Company does not provide any essential technical information to the investee.
vi) As these are not investments strategic to the core business of HUL, these are intended to be divested/liquidated in the near future.
As the interests in above enterprises originated for investment purposes and are not of sufficient proportions for the Company to be  able to control or exercise significant influence on decisions of the investee, these are not being construed as associate companies  for the purpose of consolidation and therefore these have not been consolidated in the financial statement of the company.
During the current year, the Group has sold partial stake of the investments in Hi-Tech Surfactants Limited, as a result of which  the Group’s stake now stands at 18.84%.
Since the group holds less than 20% of the voting power of the investee as required by  Accounting Standard 23 (AS-23) - ‘Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements’, this company is  not an assosiate of the Group as at 31st March, 2016.

The financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries,  controlled trust and the joint venture (on a proportionate  basis) have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding  together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities,  income and expenses, after eliminating intra-group  balances, intra-group transactions and the unrealised  profits / losses, unless cost cannot be recovered.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  using uniform accounting policies for like transactions  and other events in similar circumstances.
The accounting  policies adopted in the preparation of financial statements  are consistent with those of previous year.
The excess of cost to the Group of its investment in  subsidiaries, on the acquisition dates over and above the  Group’s share of equity in the subsidiaries, is recognised  as ‘Goodwill on Consolidation’ being an asset in the  consolidated financial statements.
The said Goodwill is  not amortised, however, it is tested for impairment at each  Balance Sheet date and the impairment loss, if any, is  provided for.
On the other hand, where the share of equity  in subsidiaries as on the date of investment is in excess  of cost of investments of the Group, it is recognised as  ‘Capital Reserve’ and shown under the head ‘Reserves and  Surplpus’ in the consolidated financial statements.
“Minority Interest in the net assets of consolidated  subsidiaries is identified and presented in the consolidated  Balance Sheet separately from liabilities and equity of the  Company’s shareholders.“   “Minority interest in the net assets of consolidated  subsidiaries consists of:  (a)  The amount of equity attributable to minority at the  date on which investment in a subsidiary is made; and  (b)  The minority share of movements in equity since  the date parent subsidiary relationship came into  existence   Minority interest’s share of Net Profit / (Loss) for the year  of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and adjusted  against the profit after tax of the Group.”   All assets and liabilities have been classified as current  or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle  and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Act.
Based on the nature of products and the time between  acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in  cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its  operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of current/ non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
Transactions and balances with values below the rounding  off norm adopted by the Group have been reflected as  “0.00” in the relevant notes in these consolidated financial  statements.
2.2.
Revenue recognition   Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the  significant risks and rewards of ownership in the goods  are transferred to the buyer as per the terms of the  contract, the Group retains no effective control of the  goods transferred to a degree usually associated with  ownership and no significant uncertainty exists regarding  the amount of the consideration that will be derived  from the sale of goods.
Sales are recognised net of trade  discounts, rebates, sales taxes and excise duties (on goods  manufactured and outsourced).
Income from export incentives such as duty drawback and  premium on sale of import licences, and lease license fee  are recognised on accrual basis.
Income from Property Development Activity is recognised  in terms of arrangements with developers, where  applicable.
Income from services rendered is recognised based on  agreements/arrangements with the customers as the  service is performed using the proportionate completion  method when no significant uncertainty exists regarding  the amount of the consideration that will be derived from  rendering the service and is recognised net of service tax,  as applicable.
Interest on investments is recognised on a time proportion  basis taking into account the amounts invested and the  rate of interest.

NOTES Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited 2.3.
Expenditure  Expenses are accounted on accrual basis.
Revenue expenditure pertaining to research is charged  to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Development  costs of products are also charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss unless a product’s technical feasibility  and other criteria set out in paragraph 44 of AS 26 –  ‘Intangible assets’ have been established, in which case  such expenditure is capitalised.
The amount capitalised  comprises expenditure that can be directly attributed or  allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to creating,  producing and making the asset ready for its intended  use.
Fixed assets utilised for research and development  are capitalised and depreciated in accordance with the  policies stated for Tangible Assets.
2.4.
Tangible assets   Tangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any.
Subsequent expenditures related to an item  of tangible asset are added to its book value only if they  increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond  its previously assessed standard of performance.
Items of tangible assets that have been retired from  active use and are held for disposal are stated at the  lower of their net book value and net realisable value and  are shown separately in the financial statements under  “Other current assets”.
Any expected loss is recognised  immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Tangible assets not ready for the intended use on the date of  Balance Sheet are disclosed as “Capital work-in-progress”.
Losses arising from the retirement of, and gains or losses  arising from disposal of tangible assets which are carried  at cost are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on the straight  line method over the useful life as prescribed under  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 with the exception  of the following:   - plant and equipment is depreciated over 2 to 21 years  based on the technical evaluation of useful life done by the  management.
- certain assets lying at salons and training centre, included  in plant and equipment, furniture and fixtures and office  equipment, are depreciated over five to nine years.

5,000 or less are fully depreciated in  the year of purchase.
2.5.
Intangible assets   Intangible assets are stated at acquisition cost, net of  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any.
Intangible assets are amortised on the  straight line basis as per rates mentioned below: Asset class Rate of amortisation Goodwill 25% Brands/ trademarks 25% Computer software 20% 2.6.
Impairment   Assessment for impairment is done at each Balance Sheet  date as to whether there is any indication that an asset  (tangible and intangible) may be impaired.
For the purpose  of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group  of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing  use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from  other assets or groups of assets is considered as a cash  generating unit.
If any such indication exists, an estimate  of the recoverable amount of the individual asset/cash  generating unit is made.
Assets whose carrying value  exceeds their recoverable amount are written down to  the recoverable amount by recognising the impairment  loss as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s or cash  generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash  flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an  asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.
Assessment is also done at each Balance Sheet date as  to whether there is any indication that an impairment loss  recognised for an asset in prior accounting periods may no  longer exist or may have decreased.
2.7.
Investments   Investments are classified into current and long term  investments.
Current investments are stated at the lower  of cost and fair value.
Long-term investments are stated  at cost.
A provision for diminution is made to recognise  a decline, other than temporary, separately for each  individual long term investments.
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to  be held for not more than one year from the date on which  such investments are made, are classified as “Current  investments”.
All other investments are classified as  “Long-term investments”.
Investment in land and buildings that are not intended to  be occupied substantially for use by, or in the operations  of the company, have been classified as investment  property.
Investment properties are carried at cost less  Consolidated 156 to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2016 (Contd.)

Interests in joint venture   Interests in Jointly controlled entities (incorporated  Joint Venture) are accounted for using proportionate  consolidation method.
2.9.
Inventories   Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realisable value.
Cost is computed on a weighted average  basis.
The net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated  costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to  make the sale.
Finished goods and work-in-progress  include all costs of purchases, conversion costs and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present  location and condition.
2.10.
Trade receivables and Loans and advances   Trade receivables and Loans and advances are stated after  making adequate provisions for doubtful balances.

Provisions and Contingent liabilities   Provisions are recognised when there is a present  obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will  be required to settle the obligation and there is a reliable  estimate of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are  measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required  to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date  and are not discounted to its present value.
These are  reviewed at each year end date and adjusted to reflect the  best current estimate.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a  possible obligation arising from past events, the existence  of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or  non occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not wholly within the control of the Group or a present  obligation that arises from past events where it is either  not probable that an outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount  cannot be made.
2.12.
Retirement / post retirement benefits  Defined contribution plans   Contributions to defined contribution schemes such  as employees’ state insurance, labour welfare fund,  superannuation scheme, employee pension scheme  etc.
are charged as an expense based on the amount of  contribution required to be made as and when services  are rendered by the employees.
Group’s provident fund  contribution, in respect of certain employees, is made to a  government administered fund and charged as an expense  to the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The above benefits are  classified as Defined Contribution Schemes as the Group  has no further defined obligations beyond the monthly  contributions.
Defined benefit plans   In respect of certain employees, provident fund  contributions are made to a trust administered by the  Group.
The interest rate payable to the members of the  trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest  declared by the Central Government under the Employees  Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952  and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Group.
The liability in respect of the shortfall of interest earnings  of the Fund is determined on the basis of an actuarial  valuation.
The Group also provides for retirement / post- retirement benefits in the form of gratuity, pensions (in  respect of certain employees), compensated absences (in  respect of certain employees) and medical.
The Group’s  liability towards such defined benefit plans is determined  based on valuations, as at the balance sheet date, made  by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit  method.
Actuarial gains and losses in respect of the  defined benefit plans are recognised in the Statement  of Profit and Loss in the year in which they arise.
The  classification of the Group’s net obligation into current and  non- current is as per the actuarial valuation report.
Termination benefits   Termination benefits, in the nature of voluntary retirement  benefits or termination benefits arising from restructuring,  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when:  a) the Group has a present obligation as a result of past  event; b) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount  of the obligation; and c) it is probable that an outflow of  resources embodying economic benefits will be required  to settle the obligation.
2.13.
Income Taxes   Tax expense for the year comprises current tax and  deferred tax.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be  paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities using the  applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax is recognised for all the timing differences,  subject to the consideration of prudence in respect of  deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are  measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been  enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet  date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised and carried  forward only to the extent that there is a reasonable  certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be  Overview Reports Financial Statements Shareholder Information 157 (All amounts in Rs.
crores, unless otherwise stated) to the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2016 (Contd.)
NOTES Annual Report 2015-16 Hindustan Unilever Limited available against which such deferred tax assets can be  realised.
In situations where the Group has unabsorbed  depreciation or carry forward tax losses, all deferred tax  assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that they can be realised  against future taxable profits.
The carrying amount of  deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date  for any write down, as considered appropriate.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset  when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the  recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the  asset and the liability on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets  and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a  legally enforceable right to set off assets against liabilities  representing current tax and where the deferred tax assets  and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied  by the same governing taxation laws.
2.14.
Foreign currency translations   Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the  exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such  transactions and from the translation of monetary assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Forward exchange contracts outstanding as at the year  end on account of firm commitment transactions are  marked to market and the losses, if any are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss and gains are ignored  in accordance with the Announcement of the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India on ‘Accounting for  Derivatives’ issued in March 2008.
2.15.

The Group is both a lessee  and a lessor under such arrangements.
Payments and  receipts under such leases are charged or credited to the  Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over  the primary period of the lease.
2.16.
Segment reporting   The accounting policies adopted for segment reporting are  in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for the  Group.
Further,  a)  Inter segment revenue has been accounted for based  on the transaction price agreed to between segments  which is primarily market based.
b)  Revenue and expenses have been identified to  segments on the basis of their relationship to the  operating activities of the segment.
Revenue and  expenses, which relate to the Group as a whole and  are not allocable to segments on a reasonable basis,  have been included under “Un-allocated corporate  expenses net of un-allocated income”.
2.17.
Cash and cash equivalents   In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents  include cash in hand, term deposits with banks and  other short-term highly liquid investments with original  maturities of three months or less.
2.18.
Earnings per share   Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by  the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
The weighted average number of equity  shares outstanding during the period and for all periods  presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares,  other than the conversion of potential equity shares, that  have changed the number of equity shares outstanding,  without a corresponding change in resources.
For the  purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net  profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding  during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive  potential equity shares.
2.19.
Employee share based payments   Equity settled stock options granted under “HUL ESOP/  Performance Shares Schemes” are accounted for  under the intrinsic value method as per the accounting  treatment prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board of  India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014,  issued by Securities and Exchange Board of India and  the Guidance Note on Employee Share-based Payments  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
2.20.
Use of estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity  with the generally accepted accounting principles requires  that the management makes estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the date of the  financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue  and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results  could differ from those estimates.
2.21.
Government Grants   Government Grants and subsidies are received and  recognised after fulfilling the conditions attached to  them.
Government grants are of the nature of promoters’  contribution and are credited to Capital Subsidy which is  treated as part of Reserves and Surplus.
