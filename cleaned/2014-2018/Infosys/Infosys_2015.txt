Annual Report 2014-15  Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 K. Dinesh The year 2014 was a milestone in our Company's  history, when we bid farewell to three of our  founders who held executive positions in the  Company during the year – Narayana Murthy,  S. Gopalakrishnan and S. D. Shibulal.
Narayana Murthy stepped down as the Chairman  of the Board on October 10, 2014.
His vision,  leadership and guidance have been an inspiration  to Infosys, the Indian IT industry and an entire  generation of technology entrepreneurs.
He propelled the Company into accomplishing  many firsts and in setting industry benchmarks on  several fronts.
He espoused the highest level of  corporate governance standards that have defined  Infosys over the years and made us a globally  respected corporation.
Between June 2013 and  October 2014, he guided the Company through  a period of stabilization and leadership transition.
S. Gopalakrishnan stepped down as Vice Chairman  of the Board on October 10, 2014.
Kris, as he  is popularly known, served the Company in  several capacities over the last 33 years.
As the  Chief Executive Officer between 2007 and 2011,  he steered the Company at a time when the world  was faced with economic crises.
Ranked as a global  thought leader, Kris has led the technological  evolution of the Company.
S. D. Shibulal stepped down as the Company's  Chief Executive Officer on July 31, 2014.
Shibu, as he is fondly called, was instrumental  in the evolution of our Global Delivery Model,  and pioneered initiatives to expand our business  portfolio with consulting services and intellectual  property creation.
Earlier, as our Chief Operating  Officer, he strengthened the Company's business  model to cater to a broadening portfolio of  services, expanded client relationships and scalable  operations.
In October 2014, at an event to celebrate them  and the other founders — Nandan M. Nilekani,  K. Dinesh, N. S. Raghavan, and Ashok Arora — the  Company and its well-wishers paid tribute to the  founders’ bold vision, generosity of character and  phenomenal achievements, and thanked them  for laying the foundation of values that still drive  us today.
Although they are no longer a part of  the day -to-da y operations of the Company, we at  Infosys are committed to continuing the journey  that was started all those years ago.
In the words  of John F. Kennedy, “As we express our gratitude,  we must never forget that the highest appreciation  is not to utter words but to live by them.
” In fiscal 2015, we also bid farewell to executive  directors Srinath Batni and B. G. Srinivas, who were  an integral part of the Infosys journey.
To these gentlemen and their families, on behalf  of our employees and investors, we express our  deepest appreciation and our fondest wishes for  a bright future.

– Culture of Learning and Education When Dr. Negroponte made this observation more  than 20 years ago, the digital revolution was in  its infancy.
Today, it is all around us, transforming  every industry and walk of life in a fundamental  way.
The transformation creates value by dissolving  intermediary layers, and bringing intelligence and  empowerment directly to the end-points.
What  this means for us is an unprecedented opportunity  to renew businesses, and also to build completely  new ones.
Our corporate strategy focuses on both renew and  new and we focus on how we are implementing  these elements throughout this report.
Renewal involves the re-thinking of existing  business systems and processes by leveraging  new technologies and platforms – such as cloud,  Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director U.

– Culture of Learning and Education Our culture of continuous learning and  education is the fundamental enabler of  our renew and new strategy mobility, analytics, and sensor networks.
For us,  it implies a need to renew existing service lines,  such as consulting, business process management,  engineering services, application development  and maintenance, infrastructure management,  testing services, digital services, and package  implementation.
These services have potential  for significant renewal through automation,  innovation and operational excellence.
New elements involve new ways of engaging with,  and understanding customers – and exploring  new markets and business models.
This opens up  opportunities for us to build strategic partnerships  with clients, and co-create innovative solutions  by leveraging the power of Design Thinking.
It requires developing excellence in areas such as  artificial intelligence, big data and analytics, open  source software, and a deep engagement with the  start-up community.
Our culture of continuous learning and education  is the fundamental enabler of our renew and new   strategy.
Since its founding, Infosys has always  had a deep learning culture.
This differentiated  capability makes us uniquely equipped to embrace  change, and to amplify and accelerate value  creation for our clients and ourselves.

– Culture of Learning and Education Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Ravi Kumar S. Executive Vice President and  Global Head of Delivery The renew and new strategy has been the  fundamental axis around which we have  re- imagined all our core service lines.
The goal is  to enhance our competitive advantage to sharper  service line differentiation.
The most significant change made to renew the  delivery organization is to restructure it around  service line stacks globally.
This will ensure clearer  accountability for differentiating our service lines  and thereby increase our market share.
Here are  a few examples on how we are renewing our  current services  : Cloud and Infrastructure  : We have embraced  extreme automation to significantly reduce  total cost of ownership for our clients.
Our deep  expertise in cloud services provides a compelling  solution involving new areas of Information  Technology – Operation Technology (IT/OT),  Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics.
Independent Validation Services  : In today's  dynamic business world, the price of failure and,  consequently, the price of rectification are going  up exponentially.
This means that verification and  validation of products and services must upgrade  and improve radically.
Our Validation group is  investing in automation tools and developing  a partner ecosystem.
We are also operationalizing  innovative ideas, including crowd testing and  machine learning-enabled automation.

– Culture of Learning and Education Consumer experience is evolving every day.
Value  chains are getting disintermediated, computing  capability is scaling, and new business models are  taking root even before previous ones stabilize.
To stay relevant, our clients need to develop new  approaches for renewing their existing businesses  and concurrently imagine and innovate completely  new businesses.
Our consultants, operating in  over 20 key markets, are partnering with clients to  rapidly design business models, develop business  processes and adapt to technology footprints that  address this new reality.
We are doing this in three  significant ways  : Design  : By leveraging Design Thinking, we are  helping our clients gain a deeper understanding  of their business and develop innovative  responses to their most significant growth and  cost challenges.
Across industry segments, we  are investing in educating our clients on Design  Thinking, conducting design workshops to  work on significant challenges, and extending  rapid prototyping capabilities to develop  innovative solutions.
Transcend  : We are helping our clients transcend  the limitations of traditional software packages by  combining new technologies, open source and  start-up innovations with our core capabilities  in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), digital,  analytics and organizational change.
We are  leveraging our new platforms in this journey.
Accelerate  :  The speed with which our clients  respond to new realities is limited by their ability  to change complex current technology landscapes.
We are helping clients address this challenge by  capturing the knowledge embedded in current  applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Further, we are simplifying their functioning  using cloud technologies, improving operational  efficiency with automation, enhancing user  experience by creating Application Programing  Interfaces (APIs) and developing new applications.
Learning and sharing are the foundations of our  global consulting capability.
Every week, our  consultants are sharing new industry-specific  points of view with clients in innovative and  immersive ways.
As management consultants,  we are aggressively working towards being the  design partners of our clients rather than limiting  ourselves to being traditional advisors and  aggregators of past knowledge.

On the one hand,  all existing systems — and the processes that they  run — must be renewed to help enterprises deal  with change.
On the other hand, next-generation  business challenges need to be addressed.
This, in essence, means that we are dealing with  two complementary themes.
The first is the  renewal of the known – bringing transformation  improvements to our traditional process  management, through automation, repeatability  and artificial intelligence.
Simultaneously, we need  to focus our creativity and imagination on finding  solutions for new kinds of business challenges.

Build great user experiences  :  We have embarked  on a journey to deeply understand our end -users  through the Design Thinking framework.
This approach puts usability at the forefront  of our solutions.

This innovative solution opens up new revenue  streams for banks.
While we do all this and more, it is important to  remind ourselves that we are building this on  our culture of innovation, purpose and learning.
We will leverage inherent synergies by bringing our  products to each of our clients, thereby helping  the cross -pollination of best practices.
By delivering  pre- packaged cloud services in critical frontline  areas, such as digital marketing, multi-channel  commerce and trade, we will enable networked  business models and operations in the new  digital economy.
Our product solutions from Finacle and  EdgeVerve — around procurement, supply chain,  marketing, e-commerce and asset management —  are designed to bring about technology  transformations for our clients.

– Culture of Learning and Education about the acquisition of Panaya, which significantly  enhances our automation capabilities in our  packaged software offerings.
We have been using Design Thinking as  a problem -finding methodology, which has  in turn led us to apply some of the advances  in technology to business outcomes.
These  applications that we build not only give us new  revenue streams but also strengthen our platforms  and differentiate us from pure technology and  service providers.
The foundation for all this is the active culture  of learning at Infosys that has made it easier for  us to welcome new technologies to amplify  our potential, and extend the learning to our  employees and customers alike.
We are injecting new ideas and processes into  our existing platform offerings, and adopting new  problem-solving techniques.
This enables us to  deliver next-generation solutions to our clients.
We have narrowed our focus to three major areas  that we believe will be critical in building the next  big platform solution.
These are data, automation  and intelligence.
Leveraging the power of open  source, we have launched the Infosys Information  Platform (IIP), a data analytics platform that enables  businesses to operationalize their data assets and  uncover new opportunities for rapid innovation  and growth.
IIP has already helped a leading global  agri-business client improve the performance of its  management reporting system.
We are consolidating reusable assets across all  our customer engagements and driving efficiency  in each of our service lines.
In the operations of  Infosys BPO, we are identifying repeatable steps  that can be automated both from the process  and experience perspectives, and applying these  learnings across industries.
In a similar vein, in  our infrastructure managed services, we are  focusing on automation, particularly with the aim  of reducing the number of tickets or alerts that  are manually handled, resulting in higher quality  of service delivery, lower risk, and the ability  to do more.
We have been concentrating so far on operations  management for our clients.
But we want to get  to a place where we will be managing exceptions,  and not entire operations.
We believe that the  combined power of data analytics, automation  and intelligence will help us make the big leap  from operations management to exception  management.
In this context, we are very excited  We have narrowed  our focus to three  major areas that  we believe will be  critical in building  the next big  platform solution.

– Culture of Learning and Education Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Design Thinking is an important enabler for us to  renew our existing business, and to pursue new  areas of innovation, by leveraging our foundation  in learning and education.
Design Thinking  improves creative confidence, and the ability to  proactively find problems, which are meaningful to  clients, and provide innovative solutions to them.
Design Thinking encourages us to re-frame  problems from an empathetic, human-centered  perspective.
It advocates rapid prototyping as  a way to experiment, to improve learning velocity  and to find solutions quickly.
The key feature of  the exercise is that we need to work continuously  at the intersection of desirability, feasibility  and viability.
On Desirability (D)  Think back to the last time you experienced  delight.
It could have been in the context of  a product or a service, or during an interaction  with a person.
Delight can be a powerful and  positive emotion.
Product designers have always  known that invoking delight in the person who  interacts with the product is critical for commercial  success.
More recently, the understanding of the  value in creating such delightful experiences has  transcended the product world, and has been  shown to apply equally to every function – in  services, in customer relationships, in operations,  and in learning and education.
Design Thinking gives us a framework to engage  with end-consumers of these products or services  in rich, meaningful conversations early in the  process – and rapidly iterate towards the desirable  solutions.
On Feasibility (F) Available technology dictates what products  and services we can possibly build at any time.
For example, the miniaturization of electronic  circuits now makes it possible to create sensors  so small that they can be injected into the blood  stream of humans, leading to early detection of  heart attacks and many other diseases.
Something  like this, even if desirable, may not have been  technologically feasible just a few years ago.
The key feature of the Design Thinking  exercise is that we need to work continuously  at the intersection of desirability, feasibility  and viability Gaining an  edge with Design  Thinking Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Renew.
New.
– Culture of Learning and Education On Innovative Teams (D+F+V) The three principles above need to be applied  simultaneously at every stage of the innovation  process for it to be effective.
A product or service  that optimizes one of these factors, while ignoring  the others, will fail in the marketplace.
A 'T-shaped' individual is someone who has depth  in any one of these three areas, and has a strong  understanding and respect for the other two as well.
The most successful teams are those that are made  up of diverse and T-shaped people.
It is for this  reason that we at Infosys are focusing our efforts  on establishing multi-disciplinary teams made  up of strong innovators.
Spurred by this thinking,  we are rolling out exceptional training and  education programs, which teach technologists  and managers about design and business, and  business experts about technology.
In the early stages of any new endeavor, before  any financial metrics exist, the only metric that  indicates progress is the velocity of learning.
Thanks to the strong foundation in education put  in place by our founders, we are uniquely prepared  to take on this challenge.
Ritika Suri Vice President and Global Head –  Corporate Development Navin Budhiraja Vice President and Head –  Architecture and Technology Sanjay Rajagopalan Vice President and Head –  Design and Research Design Thinking requires one to build early  prototypes to validate the feasibility — or the  ability to implement using available technology —  of those ideas.
These rapid iterations also allow  one to try different possible solutions to the same  problem, thus increasing the likelihood of finding  one that is both desirable and feasible.
On Viability (V) The rapid, iterative, human-centric perspective in  Design Thinking drives a deep understanding of  the business needs of clients.
This understanding,  early in the process, steers focus on areas of  greatest impact, both in terms of business  outcomes or economic returns.
In the process,  it unlocks new and more sources of value with  agile and adaptive commercialization models.

163 2 | Letter to the stakeholder Dear Stakeholder, I am extremely proud and at the same time  humbled to write to you for the first time as the  CEO of Infosys.
As someone who grew up in the  world of technology and IT, I have tremendous  respect for what Infosys’ founders have built.
Mr. Murthy and his co-founders opened an entirely  new industry and with that, an opportunity for  businesses to operate in entirely new ways and  to bring new value by leveraging IT services.
They also opened an unprecedented opportunity  for people to pursue new career paths and  new beginnings inside and outside their native  countries.
Infosys helped to not only make the  world flat but articulated this in a way that opened  imaginations worldwide.
The Infosys founders  were true entrepreneurs, but the unique things  they brought to the company put Infosys in a  different league – a sense of responsibility and  quality in serving clients, an unparalleled integrity  and transparency in operations, and a culture and  a deeply held passion for education and training,  scaling mountaintops only a rare few companies  achieve in their entire history.
When we look at Infosys today, we can see that  it has been a year of great transition for the  company.
Our full-year performance was average.
There were hard-fought battles in a difficult  climate, one in which clients’ expectations are  changing, new emerging technologies are rapidly  coming to market and where the landscape of  services companies has become vastly more  competitive.
We also faced our own internal issues  leading to lagging growth while high attrition  rates and the departures of many key executives  put tremendous pressure on our business and on  performance.
We were learning to work in a new  environment and in new ways, and it has been  a difficult learning experience.
But, with learning  comes the promise of renewing ourselves and the  opportunity to pursue entirely new horizons.
As I look over the last year, I already see many  promising signs for the future.
For the year ended  March 31, 2015, consolidated revenues were  ` 53,319 cr ore, which is a year-on-year growth of  6.4%.
In U.S. dollar terms, consolidated revenues  were US $8,711 million, which is a year-on-year  growth of 5.6%.
We saw significant cross-currency  movements during the year, and our revenues  grew by 7.1% in constant currency.
Our focus on operational improvements led to an  increase in offshore effort mix from 69.4% in fiscal  2014 to 71.2% in fiscal 2015.
Additionally, utilization  (excluding trainees) improved from 76.4% in fiscal  2014 to 80.9% in fiscal 2015.
These measures  led to a significant improvement in operating  margins to 25.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 24.0%  in fiscal 2014.
This improvement was despite  Letter to the stakeholder Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director When we look at Infosys  today, we can see that it has  been a year of great transition  for the company Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 our strategy to achieve large-scale growth is the  right one.
We have taken several measures to  improve our competitiveness in winning large  deals in areas such as application maintenance,  software testing, infrastructure management  and business process outsourcing.
We realigned  our organizational structure to increase focus  on expanding client relationships while at the  same time defragmenting our service lines to  enable innovation and better solution building.
We continue to invest in automation solutions such  as the Infosys Automation Platform and through  our recent acquisition of Panaya.
We continue  to sharpen accountability at all levels of the  organization for delivering client value and for  revenue growth.
We are putting in place structures  that enable us to leverage our consulting and  technology strengths to proactively identify  opportunities for innovative, high impact strategic  projects.
And we are simplifying and improving our  processes to become a highly connected, agile and  innovative organization, where accountability and  empowerment go hand in hand.
In new areas, we are training our own internal  teams in Design Thinking and bringing this  powerful methodology of finding, defining and  solving entirely new problems to our clients –  already reaching 25,000 employees and many  clients.
In big data and platforms, we introduced  the Infosys Information Platform to help our clients  capture, analyze and act on data in new ways,  all using open source technologies that bring more  security and agility, and an unprecedented price  performance to enterprises.
In artificial intelligence,  we are working with clients to identify and build  solutions for highly complex business problems.
Going beyond automation, we are bringing  artificial intelligence to more cognitive tasks that  previously have not been solvable by software or  stepped up investments in the business – we gave  compensation increases to our employees effective  April 1, 2014 and followed it up with a second  round of increases to over 20,000 employees in  Q3; we promoted over 25,000 employees during  fiscal 2015 and increased the variable salary  payout to 86% in fiscal 2015 compared to 64% in  fiscal 2014.
During the year, employee headcount  increased to 1,76,187 from 1,60,405 for Infosys and  its subsidiaries.
The improvement in operating margins also  reflected in net profits growing by 15.8% year on  year to ` 12,329 cr ore for the year ended March 31,  2015.
Consequently, Earnings Per Share (EPS) also  grew 15.8% to ` 107.88 dur ing the year.
We have  been able to reduce quarterly annualized attrition  for Infosys Limited from 23.4% in Q1 2015 to 13.4%  in Q4 2015.
The number of employees leaving  Infosys Limited has reduced by more than half  from May 2014 to March 2015.
This shows that  our efforts to increase investments in employees,  provide them opportunities for promotion and  increase the ease of doing business through  simplification of internal processes, are being  recognized by our employees.
With the objective of broadening the  shareholder base and further enhancing liquidity,  we announced a bonus issue of 1:1 in October  2014 which was completed in December 2014.
This led to a 24% increase in the number of  shareholders from 3,62,000 in September 2014  to 4,48,000 in December 2014.
The Board, in  its meeting on April 24, 2015, has considered,  approved and recommended another 1:1 bonus  issue for shareholders’ approval.
In line with our focus on enhancing shareholder  returns, the Board decided to increase the dividend  payout ratio from up to 40% of post - tax profits  to up to 50% of post-tax profits effective fiscal  2015.
This translates to a final dividend of ` 29.50  per share for fiscal 2015 (equivalent to `  14.75  per share after the 1:1 bonus issue, if approved  by shareholders).
We had liquid assets of ` 32,585  crore at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared to  ` 30,251 cr ore at the end of fiscal 2014.
Overall, there are many positive signs within these  numbers, and I believe this is an indication that  Letter to the stakeholder | 3  The strategy of renew  and new is taking hold and  making its way tangibly to  our clients Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 asset – our people.
There is a feeling among our  clients that we have elevated the conversation  significantly to something much more strategic.
The strategy of renew and new is taking hold and  making its way tangibly to our clients.
The strength of our organization, our brand and  our business was reflected in numerous awards  and recognitions that we won during the year in  aspects as diverse as business and management,  technology innovation, diversity, sustainability, and  service offerings.
While each one of them is special,  we are especially proud of the awards we have  won for Corporate Governance, and our Diversity  and Sustainability initiatives, since these reflect our  ethos and define who we are.
Our Sustainability  Report provides detailed information on our  responsible business practices across parameters  in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's  G4 framework.
Going forward, I see tremendous potential for us to  grow and lead.
However, it will take us time to see  the results of the changes we have made, and are  continuing to make, within and outside.
It will take  us time to renew and re - imagine how we work,  from sales to client services to delivery to finance  and legal.
I believe we have a promising year ahead of us in  the near term.
Our year-on-year guidance for fiscal  2016 is for growth to be in the range of 10 -12% in  constant currency.
Looking beyond this year, the  mission of our management team is to prepare the  company to achieve an aspirational goal of US $20  billion in revenue by calendar 2020 with at least  30% operating margin, with specific targets of: • Increasing revenue per FTE to US $80,000 by  deploying automation and innovation in existing  businesses, with a goal of generating at least  30% productivity improvements in existing  service lines from these solutions and thereby  making us more competitive to win large deals.
• New platforms and our Edge portfolio working  on different revenue models will contribute  disproportionately to our revenue per person.
• New services such as Design Thinking, solutions  in artificial intelligence and intellectual  property-led businesses to contribute at least  10% of revenues.
4 | Letter to the stakeholder systems – specific complex business problems  such as airplane engine balancing through artificial  neural networks, or incident ticket classification  through a mix of unsupervised topic models and  supervised learnings.
I believe we are far ahead of  others in this space.
There are many more things  we will do in the new aspect of our strategy, for  ourselves and with our clients, and this will begin  to contribute significantly to our overall revenue  through new revenue models and by enabling us  to be much more proactive in growing our existing  client relationships in more meaningful ways.
We are also increasing the depth of what we  can do ourselves with strategic acquisitions  and investments.
We acquired Panaya, which is  enabling us to bring higher-margin solutions to  our clients in the area of automation; we are also  acquiring Skava, which will enable us to bring  entirely new digital retail shopping experiences  to our large retail clients.
We have made some  key investments which I believe will help us look  to entirely new areas, for example through our  investment in Nova, a venture between Infosys  and DreamWorks Animation, a leader in animation  technology and animation films.
Nova will  develop and commercialize image-generation  technology in order to provide end-to-end  digital manufacturing capabilities for companies  involved in the design, manufacturing, marketing  or distribution of physical consumer products.
We are also investing in Airviz in the internet of  things area.
Across all these areas of renew and new, we are  sharply differentiating our existing services to be  more competitive in the marketplace.
We have also  begun to create new revenue models and new  consumption models that bring more value to  our clients and ultimately will bring more value to  shareholders through high-growth areas such as  new services and business models, new platforms  and new unique skills among our most important  Going forward, I see  tremendous potential for  us to grow and lead Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 And finally, I would like to say a special word of  thanks to Mr. Murthy for his extraordinary creation,  his tremendous service to this company and for  his support in our transition.
The deep culture of  education and training that Mr. Murthy and the  Infosys founders created from the beginning will  be the foundation of our success going forward.
It is what will open our minds and imaginations  to our own potential, and to the challenges we  will face, and overcome.
I look forward to sharing  our progress and milestones, as we scale these  next frontiers, on an ongoing basis with clients,  partners, shareholders and with all of you.
Chennai   April 24, 2015 Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director Letter to the stakeholder | 5  • Inorganic investment strategies to influence  approximately US $1.5 billion of new revenue.
• Bringing attrition levels down to the lowest  in the industry and achieving at least 25% in  diversity in our top leadership.
Our aspiration is  to make Infosys a great place to work, attracting  the best talent in the industry globally.
• Building a vibrant ecosystem from the ground  up by investing in, incubating and growing  innovative start-ups and companies that will  help define the next generation of services and  business models.
As I look ahead to the coming year, and to our next  33 years, I see incredible opportunities in front of  us, as a company, as employees and as an industry.
There is fundamental change happening all around  us, a digital transformation that is bringing about  an entirely new way for each of us, in all walks of  life, to work, live and interact.
I am excited by the  role Infosys plays in this journey, by our potential  to become the leading IT services company in the  world, and a bellwether once again.

Remuneration of KMPs and other employees Policy on the remuneration of KMPs and other employees : Fixed pay The remuneration and reward structure for employees comprises two  broad components — annual remuneration and long-term rewards.
The committee would determine the remuneration of the directors and  formulate guidelines for the remuneration payable to the employees.
These guidelines are as under :  Annual remuneration  Annual remuneration refers to the annual compensation payable to  the employees of the Company .
This comprises two parts – a fixed  component and a performance-linked variable component based  on the extent of achievement of the individual's objectives and  performance of the business unit.
Every employee is required to sign  a performance contract which clearly articulates the key performance  measures for that particular defined role.
The performance-linked  variable pay will be directly linked to the performance on individual  components of the performance contract and the overall performance  of the business.
An employee's variable pay would, therefore, be  directly dependent on key performance measures that represent the  best interests of shareholders.
The objective is to set the total remuneration at levels that would  attract, motivate and retain high-caliber, high -potential personnel in  a competitive global market.
The total remuneration level is to be  reset annually based on a comparison with the relevant peer group  globally , established through independent compensation surveys, from  time to time.
Long-term rewards  Long-term rewards may include Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP),  under which incentives would be granted to eligible key employees  based on their contribution to the performance of the Company ,  relative position in the organization, and length of service under the  supervision and approval of the committee.
The Company could  implement various long-term awards schemes that could include LTIP  spread over several years with payouts in multiple tranches linked to  Company's performance.
Another form of long -term awards could  be in the nature of stock options of the Company .
Stock options may  be granted to key employees and high performers in the organization  who would be selected by the committee based on their criticality ,  past performance and potential.
The grant, vesting and other scheme  details would be formulated from time to time.
These long-term reward schemes are implemented to attract and retain  key talent in the industry .
Minimum remuneration to managing director If, in any financial year, the Company has no profits or its profits  are inadequate, the Company shall pay remuneration to its managing  director in accordance with the provisions of Schedule V of the  Companies Act, 2013 or, if it is not able to comply with such  provisions, with the prior approval of the Central Government.
Remuneration to non-executive / independent directors Remuneration  The remuneration payable to each non-executive director is based  on the remuneration structure as determined by the Board, and is  revised from time to time, depending on individual contribution, the  Company's performance, and the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 and the rules made thereunder.
The remuneration to non-executive directors (including independent  directors) may be paid within the monetary limit approved by  shareholders, subject to the limit not exceeding 1% of the profits  of the Company computed as per the applicable provisions of the  Companies Act, 2013.
The remuneration structure for independent directors is as follows : Particulars Amount in USD Fixed pay 75,000  Board attendance fee (1) 25,000  Non-executive chairman fee 1,50,000  Chairperson of audit committee 30,000  Members of audit committee 20,000  Chairperson of other committees 20,000  Members of other committees 10,000  Travel fee (per meeting) (2) 10,000  (1) The Company nor mally has five regular Board meetings in a year .
Independent directors  are expected to attend the four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.
(2) For dir ectors based overseas, travel fees shown is per Board meeting.
This is based  on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated for  independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.
Stock options Independent directors shall not be entitled to any stock option of the  Company .
Policy review This policy is framed based on the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 and rules thereunder and requirements of Clause 49 of the  Listing Agreement with the stock exchanges.
In case of any subsequent changes in the provisions of the Companies  Act, 2013 or any other regulation which makes any of the provisions  in the policy inconsistent with the Act or regulations, the provisions of  the Act or regulations would prevail over the policy , and the provisions  in the policy would be modified in due course to make it consistent  with the law.
This policy shall be reviewed by the nomination and remuneration  committee as and when changes need to be incorporated in the policy  due to changes in regulations or as may be felt appropriate by the  committee.
Any change or modification in the policy as recommended  by the committee would be given for approval to the Board.

Kamath Chairperson, CSR Committee  Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 52 | Annexures to the Board's report Annexure 9 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology absorption,  foreign exchange earnings and outgo Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 Conservation of energy We continue to strengthen our energy conservation efforts.
In fiscal  2015, we were awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environment  Design (LEED) India Platinum rating for two of our buildings in  Bengaluru and Chennai.
We now have 12 LEED Platinum-rated  buildings and two buildings with GRIHA 5-star rating, making a total  of about 3.8 million sq.
ft. with the highest level of green certification.
This year, we reduced our per capita electricity consumption by over  4%.
Our concentrated efforts to redesign and retrofit our existing  buildings have helped us achieve dramatic reduction in connected  load and energy consumption.
For fiscal 2015, air conditioning  retrofits have led to 3.4 MW reduction in the connected load across  our campuses.
We used over 75 million units of electricity from renewable sources  (offsite and onsite) during this fiscal.
We have an installed solar power  plant capacity of 2.3 MW , spread across our campuses in Chennai,  Mangaluru, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru and Jaipur.
We have pioneered the radiant cooling technology in India through  radiant slab and radiant panel-based cooling systems.
We have  designed data centers with emerging green technologies to optimize  energy use and minimize our carbon footprint.
We have established  a Central Command Center in Bengaluru to monitor and optimize  our building operations remotely .
The state-of-the-art command  center manages about 138 buildings covering over 35 million sq. ft.
of built-up area across India.
Through this, we have been able to  achieve the highest level of operational efficiency of various utilities  such as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems,  data centers, smart lighting systems, and weather stations.
In the  Central Command Center, we have implemented the Central Energy  Management System (CEMS), which is an enterprise-level energy  monitoring and information tool.
We have successfully integrated  about 2,500 energy meters, including sub-station level HT energy  meters and Diesel Generators (DG), across our campuses for detailed  energy analysis and optimization.
We are the first in the building  industry to implement this level of energy meter integration.
Our water conservation strategy encompasses rainwater harvesting,  use of water-efficient fixtures for our buildings and 100% recycling of  waste water.
The highlights for this year are a 40 million liter capacity  lake in Mysuru for harvesting rainwater and the installation of about  25,000 pressure compensating aerators in the water faucets in most  of our campuses to reduce water usage.
We have also installed about  600 waterless urinals in our Bengaluru and Pune campuses, and smart  water meters in many of our campuses.
Despite the implementation of  these initiatives, we have not been able to achieve a reduction in per  capita water consumption this year.
For more details of our energy conservation initiatives, refer to our  Sustainability portal, www.infosys.com.
Technology absorption Transforming digital business engine of Infosys IT The digital business engine at Infosys comprises over 300 closely  integrated applications centrally hosted in multiple data centers with  more than 1,200 physical and virtual servers, over two petabyte of  storage, over 75 million files, and heterogeneous technology platforms.
As part of our renew and new strategy , we are transforming our digital  business engine by deploying the following strategic initiatives : Public Cloud  : Infosys.com on Azure  marked our IT team's  graduation to hosting services by Public Cloud.
We selected  Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model over on-premises hosting,  a one-of-its-kind implementation in the world, with near-foolproof  disaster recovery design and power to overcome technology  obsolescence.
Parallel data warehouse (PDW) for analytics and reporting  : Our  implementation of PDW is one of the firsts in India that will be  instrumental in self-service BI, real-time reporting, analytics for large  data volumes and unstructured data.
PDW works on Massively Parallel  Processing architecture and in one of the tests, we saw a performance  improvement of up to 600 times.
Citrix XenApp for Application Virtualization, Mobility and BYOD  :  We  enabled ubiquitous access of corporate applications for the  enterprise through the innovative deployment of Citrix XenApp.
SAP HANA for efficient processing during critical business cycles  :  We deployed SAP HANA for all critical SAP solutions including ECC,  BI and SRM, with first-in-the-world 6TB HANA from Hitachi for ECC.
This has resulted in faster data processing, real-time and advanced  analytics of large data volumes and high performance systems with  reduced support efforts.
SQL Server 2012 for core OLTP workload with enhanced high  availability and reporting : The core database workloads were migrated  from SQL Server 2008 to 2012, resulting in near real-time reporting,  improved offsite disaster recovery capabilities, significant reduction  in data duplication and up to 290 times improvement in database  workloads.
Windows Server 2012 and IIS 8.0 for core applications : The operating  systems were upgraded from Windows Server 2008 R2 to 2012, leading  to enhancements in our performance and governance capabilities.
SharePoint 2013 for portal applications and enterprise search : Portal  farms have been upgraded from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint 2013  for new features that have improved end-user experience.
Transformation at the core data center layer : This helped us overcome  application performance issues, manage exponential unstructured data  growth and enable seamless plug and play for new technologies.
IT infrastructure  Energy-efficient IT infrastructure We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our IT infrastructure  more energy-efficient.
Some of the measures implemented are as  follows : Desktop power management  : Terminator, our end-point power  management tool, shuts down computers after a specified idle period.
Paperless office drive : Several measures were taken, including secure  PIN-based printing, awareness campaigns, mailers and linking paper  consumption data to the user's carbon footprint record.
Desktop application virtualization : Leveraging Bubble computing or  Soft-grid-computing, our Computers and Communication Division  built a solution that ensured better operational efficiencies, platform  independence and productivity improvement.
Virtualization and consolidation  : We have further expanded our  internal private cloud capacity with MyCloud, which now has a capacity  of around 8,500 virtual machines.
We have continued to expand our  network-attached storage (NAS)-based virtualization this year.
Data centers and server rooms : We have standardized and incorporated  eco-friendly designs for data center and server rooms, releasing  around 100 sq.
ft. of server room or laboratory space and saving  49 KW of power this year.
Also, using hot-cold aisle separation, and  custom-made cages for the consolidation of racks, we have optimized  our air conditioning usage.
Recently , a Tier-3 data center with a  Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.6 has been commissioned at  our Hyderabad campus.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Annexures to the Board's report | 53  Unified communications solution The deployment of Lync communication has made it possible to make  calls (including video calls) directly from the system, share files /  applications, thus cutting down travel requirements of our employees  and thereby reducing CO2 emissions.
We have doubled and enhanced  our Video Conferencing (VC) capacity , resulting in a 70% increase in  our VC usage.
E-waste disposal and donation We donated 18,000 old desktops and disposed of 42 tons of e-waste,  thereby releasing 8,365 sq.
ft. of space.

Kamath Chairman  Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 54 | Annexures to the Board's report Annexure 10 – Whistleblower policy The purpose of this policy Infosys Limited (‘Infosys’) and its subsidiaries (collectively ‘the  Company’) are committed to complying with the foreign and domestic  laws that apply to them, satisfying the Company's Code of Conduct  and Ethics, and particularly to assuring that business is conducted  with integrity and that the Company's financial information is  accurate.
If potential violations of Company policies or applicable  laws are not recognized and addressed promptly , both the Company  and those working for or with the Company could face governmental  investigation, prosecution, fines, and other penalties.
That can be  costly .
Consequentially , and to promote the highest ethical standards,  the Company will maintain a workplace that facilitates the reporting  of potential violations of Company policies and applicable laws.
Employees must be able to raise concerns regarding such potential  violations easily and free of any fear of retaliation.
That is the purpose  of this policy (the ‘Policy’ or the ‘Whistleblower Policy’).
You are  required to read this Policy and submit the attached certification that  you will comply with it.
Your duty to report Everyone is required to report to the Company any suspected violation  of any law that applies to the Company and any suspected violation of  the Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics.
It is important that you  report all suspected violations.
This includes possible accounting or  financial reporting violations, insider trading, bribery , or violations of  the anti-retaliation aspects of this Policy .
Consult the Company's Code  of Conduct and Ethics for a more detailed description of potential  violations and other areas of particular concern.
Retaliation includes  adverse actions, harassment, or discrimination in your employment  relating to your reporting of a suspected violation.
It is the policy of the Company that you must, when you reasonably  suspect that a violation of an applicable law or the Company's Code of  Conduct and Ethics has occurred or is occurring, report that potential  violation.
Reporting is crucial for early detection, proper investigation  and remediation, and deterrence of violations of Company policies  or applicable laws.
You should not fear any negative consequences  for reporting reasonably suspected violations because retaliation for  reporting suspected violations is strictly prohibited by Company policy .
Failure to report any reasonable belief that a violation has occurred  or is occurring is itself a violation of this Policy and such failure will  be addressed with appropriate disciplinary action, including possible  termination of employment.
How to report You must report all suspected violations to (i) your  immediate supervisor; (ii) the Chief Compliance Officer; at   complianceoffice@infosys.com or (iii) anonymously , by sending an email  to : whistleblower@infosys.com.
If you have reason to believe that your immediate supervisor or the  Chief Compliance Officer is involved in the suspected violation, your  report may be made to the Audit Committee of Infosys' Board of  Directors (the ‘Audit Committee’) at : Chairperson, Audit Committee, Infosys Limited, 44 Electronics City ,  Hosur Road, Bengaluru – 560100.
Because you have several means of reporting, you need never report  to someone you believe may be involved in the suspected violation or  from whom you would fear retaliation.
Your report should include as much information about the suspected  violation as you can provide.
Where possible, it should describe the  nature of the suspected violation; the identities of persons involved in  the suspected violation; a description of documents that relate to the  suspected violation; and the time frame during which the suspected  violation occurred.
Where you have not reported anonymously , you  may be contacted for further information.
Investigations after you report All reports under this Policy will be promptly and appropriately  investigated, and all information disclosed during the course of the  investigation will remain confidential, except as necessary to conduct  the investigation and take any remedial action, in accordance with  applicable law.
Everyone working for or with the Company has a  duty to cooperate in the investigation of reports of violations.
Failure  to cooperate in an investigation, or deliberately providing false  information during an investigation, can be the basis for disciplinary  action, including termination of employment.
If, at the conclusion of its  investigation, the Company determines that a violation has occurred,  the Company will take effective remedial action commensurate with  the nature of the offense.
This action may include disciplinary action  against the accused party , up to and including termination.
Reasonable  and necessary steps will also be taken to prevent any further violations  of Company policy .
Retaliation is not tolerated No one may take any adverse action against any employee for  complaining about, reporting, or participating or assisting in the  investigation of, a reasonably suspected violation of any law, this Policy ,  or the Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics.
The Company takes  reports of such retaliation seriously .
Incidents of retaliation against any  employee reporting a violation or participating in the investigation of  a reasonably suspected violation will result in appropriate disciplinary  action against anyone responsible, including possible termination of  employment.

Infosys, together with its subsidiaries, is hereinafter  referred to as ‘the Group’.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in India and has its registered office at Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.
The Company has its primary listings on BSE Limited and the National  Stock Exchange in India.
The Company's American Depositary Shares  (ADS), representing equity shares, are also listed on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), NYSE Euronext London and NYSE Euronext Paris.

I I ndustry structure and developments Software and computing technology are transforming businesses in  every industry around the world in a very profound and fundamental  way .
Advances in hardware technologies and the continued reduction  in the unit cost of hardware, the explosion of network bandwidth,  advanced software technologies and technology-enabled services are  fuelling the rapid digitization of business processes and information.
Traditional business models are being disrupted in every industry , with  digital and software-based business models.
The combination of high-performing and ubiquitous real -t ime  computing, massive data streams, economic bandwidth,  hyper- connectedness and intelligent software is creating new business  opportunities for the world's leading corporations.
As these technologies  move into mass adoption, they are enabling companies to : • Create new markets quickly through differentiated products based  on technology • Enhance growth by reaching new customers, deepening the  customer experience and allowing them to dynamically manage  pricing • Increase profitability by dramatically altering operating cost  structures through greater process automation, and optimizing the  latencies of the physical world • Adopt business models that increase asset efficiency and long-term  competitiveness.
Hence, leveraging technologies and models of the digital era to both  extend the value of existing investments and, in parallel, transform and  future proof their businesses is increasingly becoming a top priority  for business leaders.
This duality — to renew existing core businesses  and innovate new businesses — is the essence of what companies are  faced with as strategic imperatives today .
From an IT perspective, the renewal translates into harnessing the  efficiency of distributed cloud computing, enabling legacy systems  for mobile and sensor access, extracting value out of digitized data,  keeping systems relevant, and optimizing the costs of building and  running technology systems.
Also, as businesses look to new areas and  new economics, new and intelligent systems are required to be built  with next-generation technologies and with exponentially superior  cost-benefit performance.
The fast pace of technology change and the need for technology  professionals who are highly skilled in both the renewal and new  technology areas, are driving businesses to rely on third parties to  realize their IT transformation.
Several technology solution and service  providers have emerged over the years, offering different models for  clients to consume their solution and service offerings : •  Technology consulting companies – who take on niche and  time-bound projects for their clients •  Global IT outsourcing companies – who leverage global talent pools  to systematically optimize the IT operations of clients •  Business process outsourcing firms – who leverage global talent  pools to manage the outsourced core business processes of  their clients •  Software firms – who provide licensed software that enable the  automation of business processes •  Specialty platform and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies –  who provide utility-based models for clients to consume software  features •  Data analytics companies – who specialize in designing, analyzing  and reporting insights from the vast amount of data that corporations  are collecting about their customers, operations and markets •  Internal IT departments of companies – which are usually cost  centers for the corporation.
1.
E volution of technology outsourcing  The nature of technology outsourcing is changing.
Historically ,  enterprises either outsourced their technology requirements entirely ,  or on a standalone, project-by-project basis.
In an environment of  rapid technological change, globalization and regulatory changes, the  complete outsourcing model is often perceived to limit a company's  operational flexibility and not fully deliver potential cost savings and  efficiency benefits.
Similarly , project-by-project outsourcing is also  perceived to result in increased operational risk and coordination  costs, besides failing to leverage technology service providers' full  range of capabilities.
To address these issues, companies are looking at  outsourcing approaches that require their technology service providers  to develop specialized systems, processes and solutions along with  cost-effective delivery capabilities.
2.
I ncreasing trend towards offshore technology  services Corporations are increasingly turning to offshore service providers to  meet their need for higher quality and cost-competitive technology  solutions.
As a result, offshore service providers have become critical  to the operations of many enterprises, and these service providers  continue to grow in recognition and sophistication.
In view of this,  the addressable market for offshore technology services has expanded.

Our revenues are segmented into onsite and offshore revenues.
Onsite revenues are for those services which are performed at our  client locations or at our development centers outside India, as part  of software projects, while offshore revenues are for services which are  performed at our software development centers in India.
The segmentation of revenues by location, including product revenue  is as follows : in % Standalone Consolidated 2015 2014 2015 2014 Onsite 50.4 51.1 51.2 52.0 Offshore 49.6 48.9 48.8 48.0 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 The proportion of work performed at our facilities and at client sites  varies from period to period.
The services performed onsite generate  higher revenues per capita, but at lower gross margins in percentage as  compared to the services performed offshore.
Therefore, any increase  in the onsite effort impacts our margins.

P rovision for tax We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas.
The Indian statutory corporate tax rate for the year ended March 31,  2015 is 33.99%.
Export profits for the year were entitled to tax benefits  under the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) scheme of the Government of  India.
The Company had also claimed tax benefit under the Software  Technology Park (STP) scheme, for export profits earned by certain  STP units up to the year ended March 31, 2011.
We have our operations both under the STP scheme and SEZ scheme.
The profits attributable to operations under the STP scheme were  exempted from income tax for a consecutive period of 10 years from  the financial year in which the unit started producing computer  software, or March 31, 2011, whichever was earlier.
However, the  income tax incentives provided by the Government of India for STP  units have expired, and the income from all of our STP units are now  taxable.
SEZ units which began providing services on or after April 1,  2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived  from the export of services for the first five years from the financial  year in which the unit has commenced the provision of services and  50% of such profits or gains for the five years thereafter.
Certain tax  benefits are also available for a further five years subject to the unit  meeting defined conditions.
On a standalone basis, the effective tax rate (based on profit before  exceptional item and tax) increased to 28.3% in fiscal 2015,  as compared to 27.2% in fiscal 2014.
This is mainly due to the increase  in overseas taxes, decrease in benefits from SEZ units as a percentage  of profit before income taxes, reduction in deductions on eligible  research, and development expense based on the approval received  from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) for  Finacle®, partially offset by the decrease in non -deductible expenses  and increase in tax reversals.
On a consolidated basis, the effective tax rate increased to 28.4% in  fiscal 2015, as compared to 27.6% in fiscal 2014, which was mainly  due to an increase in overseas taxes, a decrease in benefits from SEZ  units as a percentage of profit before income taxes, partially offset by  an increase in tax reversals, and a decrease in non-deductible expenses.
The reversal of the provision is due to the adjudication of a disputed  matter in favor of the Company and the creation of additional tax  provisions for prior years is based on tax assessments made during  the year by tax authorities.

• Negative media coverage and public scrutiny may adversely affect  the prices of our equity shares and ADSs.
• Indian law imposes certain restrictions that limit a holder's ability  to transfer the equity shares obtained upon conversion of ADSs  and repatriate the proceeds of such transfer, which may cause our  ADSs to trade at a premium or discount to the market price of our  equity shares.

Key business objec tives We have a multi-horizon strategy planning process, and we  periodically revalidate the strategic themes and the business objectives  of the Company .
The business objectives span five performance  dimensions — finance, clients and markets, operational excellence,  reputation, global talent and leadership — and the balance between  short and medium-term goals.
The corporate performance objectives  with the performance metrics and targets to be achieved during the year  are articulated in the corporate scorecard.
The corporate performance  is measured, monitored and managed on an ongoing basis.
The focus of risk management is to assess risks to the achievement  of these key business objectives and to deploy mitigation measures.
This is done through periodic review meetings of the Risk Management  Committee and the Risk Council.

R isk categories The following broad categories of risks to the business objectives have  been considered in our risk management framework : • Strategy : Risks to the successful execution of the Company's  articulated strategies.

Further, periodic assessment  of business risk environment is carried out to identify significant  risks to the achievement of business objectives and prioritizing the  risks for action.
Scenario-based risk assessments are also carried out.
Operational risks are assessed primarily on three dimensions, namely ,  strength of underlying controls, compliance to policies and procedures  and business process effectiveness.

Estimated risks are compared  against the established risk criteria.
The risk criteria include key  focus areas — strategy , growth, cost, talent, reputation, leadership  and regulatory compliance.

The trend-line  assessment of top risks, analysis of exposure and potential impact  are carried out periodically .
Mitigation plans are finalized, owners  are identified and progress of mitigation actions are monitored and  reviewed.
Further, for those business objectives, whose achievement  is at risk, periodic reviews are conducted to deploy actions.
Integration with strategy and business planning  : Identified risks to  the business objectives in the near-term, medium-term and long-term  are used as one of the key inputs for the development of strategy and  annual business plan.

Kamath Chairman Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director R. Seshasayee Director Chennai April 24, 2015 Rajiv Bansal Chief Financial Officer Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Standalone financial statements | 79  Significant accounting policies  Company overview Infosys is a global leader in consulting, technology , outsourcing and  next-generation services.
Along with its subsidiaries, Infosys provides  Business IT services (comprising application development and  maintenance, independent validation, infrastructure management,  engineering services comprising product engineering and life cycle  solutions and business process management); consulting and systems  integration services (comprising consulting, enterprise solutions,  systems integration and advanced technologies); products, business  platforms and solutions to accelerate intellectual property-led  innovation including Finacle®, our banking solution; and offerings in  the areas of analytics, cloud, and digital transformation.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in India and has its registered office at Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.
The Company has its primary listings on BSE Limited and the National  Stock Exchange in India.
The Company's American Depositary Shares  representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), NYSE Euronext London and NYSE Euronext Paris.
1 Sig nificant accounting policies 1.1 Basis of pr eparation of financial statements These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with Rule 7 of the Companies  (Accounts) Rules, 2014, the provisions of the Act (to the extent  notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board  of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been consistently applied  except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted  or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in  the accounting policy hitherto in use.
1.2 U se of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of income and expenses during the period.
Examples of such estimates include computation of percentage of  completion which requires the Company to estimate the efforts or  costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to  be expended, provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations under  employee retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post-sales customer  support and the useful lives of fixed tangible assets and intangible  assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in  estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in  circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates are  reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes  are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  financial statements.
1.3 R evenue recognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are either  on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the related  services are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing to  the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled revenues.
Revenue  from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, where there is no  uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is  recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion method.
When  there is uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability ,  revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as unbilled revenue  while billings in excess of cost and earnings are classified as unearned  revenue.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed-price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based upon  the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives  to customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Company recognizes  the liability based on its estimate of the customer's future purchases.
If it is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or  if the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then discount is  not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can be  estimated reliably .
The Company recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts using a cumulative catchup  approach.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as direct  payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from the  Company and is determined as the difference between the sale price and  carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized ratably  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized using  the time-proportion method, based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company's right to receive  dividend is established.
1.4 P rovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company  has a present legal obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
1.5 P ost-sales client support and warranties The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period warranty for  corrections of errors and support on all its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe  contracts.
Costs associated with such support services are accrued  Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 80 | Standalone financial statements at the time when related revenues are recorded and included in  Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company estimates such costs based  on historical experience and the estimates are reviewed annually for  any material changes in assumptions.
1.6 Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the  unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost of terminating  the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract.
1.7 T angible assets and capital work-in-progress Tangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until such assets are  ready for use.
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
1.8 I ntangible assets Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and impairment.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits  are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete  and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably .
1.9 D epreciation and amortization Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the straight-line  method over the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during a period is  proportionately charged.
Intangible assets are amortized over their  respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis,  commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for  its use.
The Management estimates the useful lives for the other fixed  assets as follows : Buildings (1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles (1) 5 years (1) For these classes of assets, based on internal assessment and independent technical  evaluation carried out by external valuers, the Management believes that the useful  lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to  use these assets.
Hence the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives  as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end  (Refer to Note 2.8).
1.10 I mpairment The Management periodically assesses, using external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is  higher of the asset's net selling price and value in use, which means the  present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing  use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment loss for an  asset is reversed if, and only if, the reversal can be related objectively  to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.
The  carrying amount of an asset is increased to its revised recoverable  amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated  amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized  for the asset in prior years.
1.11 R etirement benefits to employees Gratuity The Company provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan  (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible employees.
The Gratuity Plan  provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement,  death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount  based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of  employment with the Company .
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial  valuation, performed by an independent actuary , at each Balance Sheet  date using the projected unit credit method.
The Company fully  contributes all ascertained liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees'  Gratuity Fund Trust (‘the Trust’).
Trustees administer contributions  made to the Trust and contributions are invested in a scheme with  Life Insurance Corporation of India, as permitted by law of India.
The Company recognizes the net obligation of the gratuity plan in the  Balance Sheet as an asset or liability , respectively in accordance with  Accounting Standard (AS) 15, ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Company's  overall expected long-term rate-of-return on assets has been  determined based on consideration of available market information,  current provisions of Indian law specifying the instruments in which  investments can be made, and historical returns.
The discount rate  is based on the Government securities yield.
Actuarial gains and  losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the  period in which they arise.
Superannuation  Certain employees are also participants in the superannuation plan  (‘the Plan’) which is a defined contribution plan.
The Company has  no obligations to the Plan beyond its monthly contributions, which  are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is  invested with Life Insurance Corporation of India.
Provident fund Eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is  a defined benefit plan.
Both the employee and the Company make  monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified  percentage of the covered employee's salary .
The Company contributes  a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust.
The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by  Indian law.
The remaining portion is contributed to the government  administered pension fund.
The rate at which the annual interest  is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by  the government.
The Company has an obligation to make good the  shortfall, if any , between the return from the investments of the trust  and the notified interest rate.
Compensated absences The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated  absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in  nature.
The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is  determined by actuarial valuation using projected unit credit method  on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of  the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in  the period in which the absences occur.
1.12 Shar e-based payments The Company accounts for equity settled stock options as per the  accounting treatment prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board  of India (share-based employee benefits) Regulations, 2014 and the  Guidance Note on Employee Share-based Payments issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India using the intrinsic value  method.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Standalone financial statements | 81  1.13 F oreign currency transactions Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are  translated at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date.
The gains  or losses resulting from such translations are included in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value  was determined.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost  are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the date  of the transaction.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement  of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit  for the period in which the transaction is settled.
1.14  F orward and options contracts in foreign  currencies The Company uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The use  of these foreign exchange forward and options contracts reduce the  risk or cost to the Company and the Company does not use those for  trading or speculation purposes.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Company adopted AS 30, ‘Financial  Instruments : Recognition and Measur ement’, to the extent that the  adoption did not conflict with existing accounting standards and  other authoritative pronouncements of the company law and other  regulatory requirements.
Forward and options contracts are fair valued at each reporting date.
The resultant gain or loss from these transactions are recognized in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company records the gain or  loss on effective hedges, if any , in the foreign currency fluctuation  reserve until the transactions are complete.
On completion, the  gain or loss is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss of that  period.
To designate a forward or options contract as an effective  hedge, the Management objectively evaluates and evidences with  appropriate supporting documents at the inception of each contract  and subsequently whether the contract is effective in achieving  offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
In the absence  of a designation as effective hedge, a gain or loss is recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Currently hedges undertaken by the  Company are all ineffective in nature and the resultant gain or loss  consequent to fair valuation is recognized in the Statement of Profit  and Loss at each reporting date.
1.15 I ncome taxes Income taxes are accrued in the same period that the related revenue  and expenses arise.
A provision is made for income tax, based on  the tax liability computed, after considering tax allowances and  exemptions.
Provisions are recorded when it is estimated that a liability  due to disallowances or other matters is probable.
Minimum Alternate  Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise  to future economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future  income tax liability , is recognized as an asset in the Balance Sheet if  there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal tax  after the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured  reliably .
The Company offsets, on a year on year basis, the current tax  assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right, and where  it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified, and  thereafter a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets in situation where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exists, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income  will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in situation of unabsorbed depreciation  and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if there is  reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax assets are  reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying values  at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  have been offset wherever the Company has a legally enforceable  right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to  income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .
Tax benefits of  deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of  compensation charged to Statement of Profit and Loss are credited to  the securities premium reserve.
1.16 Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after  tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing  the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares  been actually issued at fair value which is the average market value of  the outstanding shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later  date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are  adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits  and bonus shares issues, including for changes effected prior to the  approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
1.17 I nvestments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance the  Company's business interests.
Investments are either classified as  current or long -term based on Management's intention.
Current  investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of each  investment individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises  the Indian rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long-term investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to  recognize any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of  each investment.
1.18 C ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash on deposit with  banks and corporations.
The Company considers all highly liquid  investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three  months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of  cash to be cash equivalents.
1.19 C ash Flow Statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit  before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 82 | Standalone financial statements 1.20 L eases Lease under which the Company assumes substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight-line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss  over the lease term.

The differential on stock compensation expense if the ‘fair value’ of the  RSUs on the date of the grant were considered instead of the ‘intrinsic  value’ during the year ended March 31, 2015 is less than ` 1 crore.
Consequently , there is no impact on earnings per share.
The fair value for the above impact analysis is estimated on the date  of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following  assumptions : Particulars Year ended  March 31, 2015 Weighted average share price (`) 3,549 Exercise price (`) 5 Expected volatility (%) 30-37 Expected life of the option (years) 1-4 Expected dividends (%) 1.84 Risk-free interest rate (%) 8-9 The expected term of an RSU is estimated based on the vesting term  and contractual term of the RSU, as well as expected exercise behavior  of the employee who receives the RSU.
Expected volatility during  the expected term of the RSU is based on historical volatility of the  observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares  during a period equivalent to the expected term of the RSU.
The weighted average fair value of RSUs on grant date was ` 3,355/- During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company recorded an  employee compensation expense of ` 2 cr ore in the Statement of Profit  and Loss.

All the assets and liabilities of ICIL on and after the appointed date  and prior to the effective date have been transferred to Infosys Limited  on a going concern basis.
As ICIL was a wholly-owned subsidiary of  Infosys Limited, no shares have been allotted to the shareholders upon  the scheme becoming effective.

2.29 S egment reporting The Company's operations predominantly relate to providing  end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business  performance.
Effective quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Company  reorganized its business to strengthen its focus on growing existing  client relationships and increasing market share through service  differentiation and operational agility .
Consequent to the internal  reorganization, there were changes effected in the reportable industry  segments based on the ‘management approach’ as laid down in AS  17, ‘Segment reporting’, and an additional segment, Life Sciences and  Healthcare, was identified.
The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the  Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis  of various performance indicators by industry classes and geographic  segmentation of customers.
Accordingly , segment information has been  presented both along industry classes and geographic segmentation  of customers, industry being the primary segment.
The accounting  principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are  consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual  segments, and are as set out in the significant accounting policies.
Industry segments for the Company are primarily enterprises in  Financial Services and Insurance (FSI), enterprises in Manufacturing  (MFG), enterprises in the Energy and utilities, Communication and  Services (ECS), enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods  and Logistics (RCL) and enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare  (LSH).
Geographic segmentation is based on business sourced from  a particular geographic region and delivered from both onsite and  offshore.
North America comprises the United States of America,  Canada and Mexico; Europe includes continental Europe (both the  east and the west), Ireland and the United Kingdom; and the Rest of  the World comprises all other places except those mentioned above  and India.
Consequent to the above change in the composition of  reportable industry segments, the prior year comparatives have been  restated.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company's offshore software  development centers and onsite expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the  underlying assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes  that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those  costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately  disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of  the Company .
Fixed assets used in the Company's business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.
Accordingly , no disclosure relating to total segment assets and liabilities  are made.
Geographical information on revenue and industry revenue  information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in  relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

In connection with this  review, the Company was advised that the DHS has found errors in a  significant percentage of its Forms I-9.
On October 30, 2013, the Company settled the foregoing matters  and entered into a Settlement Agreement (‘Settlement Agreement’)  with the U.S. Attorney , the DHS and the United States Department  of State (‘State’, and collectively with the U.S. Attorney and the DHS,  ‘the United States’).
In the Settlement Agreement, the Company denied and disputed all  allegations made by the United States, except for the allegation that the  Company failed to maintain accurate Forms I-9 records for many of its  foreign nationals in the United States in 2010 and 2011 as required by  law, and that such failure constituted civil violations of certain laws.
During the year ended March 31, 2014, the Company recorded a  charge related to the settlement agreement (including legal costs) of  ` 219 cr ore related to the matters that were the subject of the Settlement  Agreement.
The said amount was paid prior to December 31, 2013.
In addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims,  which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.

Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the  consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Company in accordance with accounting  principles generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from  material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the  Company's preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether the Company has in place adequate  internal financial controls systems over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
An audit also includes evaluating the  appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Management, as well as evaluating  the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the consolidated financial statements give a true  and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India : (i) in the case of the consolidated Balance Sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2015; (ii) in the case of the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, of the profit for the year ended on that date; and (iii) in the case of the consolidated Cash Flow Statement, of the cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Kamath Chairman Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director R. Seshasayee Director Chennai April 24, 2015 Rajiv Bansal Chief Financial Officer Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 104 | Consolidated financial statements Significant accounting policies and notes on accounts Company overview Infosys is a global leader in consulting, technology , outsourcing and  next-generation services.
Along with its subsidiaries, Infosys provides  Business IT services (comprising application development and  maintenance, independent validation, infrastructure management,  engineering services comprising product engineering and life cycle  solutions and business process management); Consulting and systems  integration services (comprising consulting, enterprise solutions,  systems integration and advanced technologies); Products, business  platforms and solutions to accelerate intellectual property-led  innovation including Finacle®, our banking solution; and offerings in  the areas of analytics, cloud, and digital transformation.
Infosys, together with its subsidiaries, is herein after referred to as  ‘the Group’.
The company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled  in India and has its registered office at Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.
The company has its primary listings on BSE Limited and the National  Stock Exchange in India.
The company's American Depositary Shares  representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock  Exchange (NYSE), NYSE Euronext London and NYSE Euronext Paris.
1 Sig nificant accounting policies 1.1 Basis of pr eparation of financial statements These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), read with Rule 7 of the Companies  (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and guidelines issued by the Securities and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been  consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard  is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard  requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the  principles and procedures required for the preparation and  presentation of consolidated financial statements as laid down under  the Accounting Standard (AS) 21, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements  of the Company , its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries as disclosed  in Note 2.21, combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together  book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses  after eliminating intra-group balances and transactions and resulting  unrealized gain / loss.
The consolidated financial statements are  prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group.
Minority interests have been excluded.
Minority interests represent  that part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that  are not, directly or indirectly , owned or controlled by the Company .
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence  but not control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the  equity method of accounting as laid down under Accounting Standard  (AS) 23, ‘Accounting for Investment in Associate in Consolidated  Financial Statements’.
The investment is initially recognized at cost,  and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the  investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition  date.
The Group's investment in associates includes goodwill identified  on acquisition.
1.2 U se of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the  period.
Examples of such estimates include computation of percentage  of completion which requires the Group to estimate the efforts or  costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to  be expended, provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations under  employee retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post-sales customer  support and the useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes  in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes  in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in  which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in  the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1.3 R evenue recognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are  either on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material  basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the related  services are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing to  the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled revenues.
Revenue  from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, where there is no  uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration,  is recognized based upon the percentage of completion method.
When there is uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability ,  revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as unbilled revenue  while billings in excess of cost and earnings are classified as unearned  revenue.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed-price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based upon  the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising from the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Group accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives to  customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Group recognizes the  liability based on its estimate of the customer's future purchases.
If it  is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or if  the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then the discount  is not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can  be estimated reliably .
The Group recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts using a cumulative catch-up  approach.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as direct  payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Consolidated financial statements | 105  The Group presents revenues net of value added taxes in its  consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from the  Group and is determined as the difference between the sale price and  carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized ratably  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized using  the time-proportion method, based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Group's right to receive  dividend is established.
1.4 P rovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group  has a present legal obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
1.5 P ost-sales client support and warranties The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period warranty for  corrections of errors and support on all its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe  contracts.
Costs associated with such support services are accrued  at the time when related revenues are recorded and included in  consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group estimates such  costs based on historical experience and the estimates are reviewed  annually for any material changes in assumptions.
1.6 Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the  unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost of terminating  the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract.
1.7 T angible assets and capital work-in-progress Tangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until such assets are  ready for use.
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
1.8 I ntangible assets including goodwill Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and impairment.
Goodwill comprises the excess of purchase  consideration over the parent's portion of equity of the subsidiary  at the date on which investment in the subsidiary is made.
Goodwill  arising on consolidation or acquisition is not amortized but is tested  for impairment.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits  are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and  use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably .
1.9 D epreciation and amortization Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the straight-line  method over the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during a period is  proportionately charged.
Intangible assets are amortized over their  respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis,  commencing from the date the asset is available to the Group for  its use.
Leasehold improvements are written off over the lower  of the remaining primary period of lease or the life of the asset.
The Management estimates the useful lives for the other fixed assets  as follows : Buildings (1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles (1) 5 years (1) For these classes of assets, based on internal assessment and independent technical  evaluation carried out by external valuers, the Management believes that the useful lives  as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these  assets.
Hence the useful lives for these assets are different from the useful lives as prescribed  under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end  (Refer to Note 2.7).
1.10 I mpairment The Management periodically assesses, using external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the  higher of the asset's net selling price and value in use, which means the  present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing  use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment loss for an  asset other than goodwill is reversed if and only if, the reversal can  be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss  was recognized.
The carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill  is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this  amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined (net of any accumulated amortization or depreciation)  had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
1.11 R etirement benefits to employees Gratuity The Group provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan  (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible employees of Infosys, Infosys  BPO and EdgeVerve.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment  to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination  of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's  salary and the tenure of employment with the Group.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial  valuation, performed by an independent actuary , at each Balance Sheet  date using the projected unit credit method.
The Company fully  contributes all ascertained liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees'  Gratuity Fund Trust (‘the Trust’).
In case of Infosys BPO and EdgeVerve,  contributions are made to the Infosys BPO's Employees' Gratuity Fund  Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust,  respectively .
Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and  these contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance  Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
The Group recognizes  the net obligation of the Gratuity Plan in the Balance Sheet as an asset  or liability , respectively in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS)  15, ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Group's overall expected long-term rate- of-return on assets has been determined based on the consideration  of available market information, current provisions of Indian law  specifying the instruments in which investments can be made, and  historical returns.
The discount rate is based on the Government  securities yield.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience  adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in  the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  they arise.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 106 | Consolidated financial statements Superannuation Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPO and EdgeVerve are  participants in a defined contribution plan (‘the Plan’).
The Group has  no further obligations to the Plan beyond its monthly contributions  which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which  is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
Provident fund Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund,  which is a defined benefit plan.
Both the eligible employee and the  Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan  equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary .
The  Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees'  Provident Fund Trust.
The trust invests in specific designated  instruments as permitted by Indian law.
The remaining portion is  contributed to the government-administered pension fund.
The rate  at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the  trust is being administered by the government.
The Company has an  obligation to make good the shortfall, if any , between the return from  the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.
In respect of Infosys BPO and EdgeVerve, eligible employees receive  benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution  plan.
Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly  contributions to this provident fund plan equal to a specified  percentage of the covered employee's salary .
Amounts collected under  the provident fund plan are deposited in a government-administered  provident fund.
The companies have no further obligations under the  provident fund plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Compensated absences The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated absences  which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature.
The  expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is  determined by actuarial valuation using projected unit credit method  on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of  the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in  the period in which the absences occur.
1.12 Shar e-based payments The Group accounts for equity settled stock options as per the  accounting treatment prescribed by Securities and Exchange Board  of India (share-based employee benefits) Regulations, 2014 and the  Guidance Note on Employee Share-based Payments issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India using the intrinsic value  method.
1.13 F oreign currency transactions Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are  translated at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date.
The gains  or losses resulting from such translations are included in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value  was determined.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost  are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the date  of the transaction.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement  of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit  for the period in which the transaction is settled.
The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries  from the local currency to the reporting currency of the Company is  performed for Balance Sheet accounts using the exchange rate in effect  at the Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items  using a monthly average exchange rate for the respective periods and  the resulting difference is presented as foreign currency translation  reserve included in ‘Reserves and surplus’.
When a subsidiary is  disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount is transferred to  profit or loss.
1.14  F orward and options contracts in foreign  currencies The Group uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The use  of these foreign exchange forward and options contracts reduces the  risk or cost to the Group and the Group does not use those for trading  or speculation purposes.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Group adopted AS 30, ‘Financial  Instruments : Recognition and Measur ement’, to the extent that the  adoption did not conflict with existing accounting standards and  other authoritative pronouncements of the Company Law and other  regulatory requirements.
Forward and options contracts are fair valued at each reporting date.
The resultant gain or loss from these transactions are recognized in  the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group records  the gain or loss on effective hedges, if any , in the foreign currency  fluctuation reserve until the transactions are complete.
On completion,  the gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss of that period.
To designate a forward or options contract  as an effective hedge, the Management objectively evaluates and  evidences with appropriate supporting documents at the inception  of each contract and subsequently whether the contract is effective  in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
In the absence of a designation as effective hedge, a gain or loss is  recognized in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Currently  hedges undertaken by the Group are ineffective in nature and the  resultant gain or loss consequent to fair valuation is recognized in  the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at each reporting date.
1.15 I ncome taxes Income taxes are accrued in the same period that the related revenue  and expenses arise.
A provision is made for income tax, based on the tax  liability computed, after considering tax allowances and exemptions.
Provisions are recorded when it is estimated that a liability due to  disallowances or other matters is probable.
Minimum alternate tax  (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise to future  economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future income tax  liability , is recognized as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet if  there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal tax after  the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured reliably .
The Group offsets, on a year-on-year basis, the current tax assets and  liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right and where it intends  to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified, and  thereafter a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets in situations where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exist, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be  realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in situations of unabsorbed  depreciation and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if  there is reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax  assets are reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying  values at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Consolidated financial statements | 107  liabilities have been offset wherever the Group has a legally enforceable  right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to  income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .
Tax benefits of  deductions earned on the exercise of employee share options in excess  of compensation charged to the consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss are credited to the securities premium reserve.
1.16 Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after  tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing  the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares  been actually issued at fair value which is the average market value of  the outstanding shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later  date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are  adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits  and bonus share issues including changes effected prior to the approval  of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.
1.17 I nvestments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance the Group's  business interests.
Investments are either classified as current or  long-term based on the Management's intention.
Current investments  are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of each investment  individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises the Indian  rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment translated  at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long-term  investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to recognize  any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of each  investment.
1.18 C ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash on deposit with  banks and corporations.
The Group considers all highly liquid  investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three  months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of  cash to be cash equivalents.
1.19 C ash Flow Statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit  before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated.
1.20 L eases Lease under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight-line basis in the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss over the lease term.
1.21 G overnment grants The Group recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable  assurance that the conditions attached to them shall be complied  with, and the grants will be received.
Government grants related to  depreciable assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized  in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and  rational basis over the useful life of the asset.
Government grants related  to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them  with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

The Board of Directors recommended establishment of the 2011 Plan  to the shareholders on August 30, 2011 and the shareholders approved  the recommendation of the Board of Directors on October 17, 2011  through a postal ballot.
The maximum aggregate number of shares  that may be awarded under the Plan is 56,67,200 (currently held  by the Infosys Limited Employees' Welfare Trust and adjusted for  bonus shares issued) and the plan shall continue in effect for a term  of 10 years from the date of initial grant under the plan.
The RSUs  will be issued at par value of the equity share.
The 2011 Plan is  administered by the management development and compensation  committee, now known as nomination and remuneration committee,  (‘the committee’) and through the Infosys Limited Employees' Welfare  Trust (‘the Trust’).
The committee comprises independent members of  the Board of Directors.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company made a grant  of 27,067 restricted stock units to Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief Executive  Officer and Managing Director.
The RSUs will vest over a period of  four years from the date of the grant in the proportions specified in  the award agreement.
The RSUs will vest subject to the achievement of  certain key performance indicators as set forth in the award agreement  for each applicable year of the vesting tranche and continued  employment through each vesting date.
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India  (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014, the excess of the  closing market price on the grant date of the RSUs over the exercise  price is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The activity in the 2011 Plan during the year ended March 31, 2015  is set out below : Particulars Year ended March 31, 2015 Shares arising  out of options Weighted  average  exercise price The 2011 Plan  Outstanding at the beginning  –  –  Granted (1)  54,134  5  Forfeited and expired  –  –  Exercised  –  –  Outstanding at the end  54,134  5  Exercisable at the end  –  –  (1) Adjusted for bonus issue The weighted average remaining contractual life of RSUs outstanding  as of March 31, 2015 under the 2011 Plan was 2.39 years.
The differential on stock compensation expense, if the ‘fair value’ of the  RSU's on the date of the grant were considered instead of the ‘intrinsic  value’ during the year ended March 31, 2015, is less than ` 1 crore.
Consequently , there is no impact on earnings per share.
The fair value for the above impact analysis is estimated on the date  of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following  assumptions : Particulars Year ended   March 31, 2015  Weighted average share price (`) 3,549 Exercise price (`) 5 Expected volatility (%) 30-37 Expected life of the option (years) 1-4 Expected dividends (%) 1.84 Risk-free interest rate (%) 8-9 Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Consolidated financial statements | 109  The expected term of an RSU is estimated based on the vesting term  and contractual term of the RSU, as well as expected exercise behavior  of the employee who receives the RSU.
Expected volatility during  the expected term of the RSU is based on historical volatility of the  observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares  during a period equivalent to the expected term of the RSU.
The weighted average fair value of RSUs on grant date was ` 3,355/- During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company recorded an  employee compensation expense of ` 2 cr ore in the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.

These demands were paid to statutory  tax authorities which includes ` 1,788 cr ore paid during the year ended March 31, 2015  consequent to demand from tax authorities in India for fiscal 2010 towards denial of certain  tax benefits.
The Company has filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate T ribunal.
Demand for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 includes disallowance of   a portion of the deduction claimed by the Company under Section 10A of the Income Tax  Act as determined by the ratio of export turnover to total turnover .
This disallowance arose  from certain expenses incurred in foreign currency being reduced from export turnover  but not reduced from total turnover .
Demand for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2009 and  fiscal 2010 also includes disallowance of portion of profit earned outside India from the  STP units and disallowance of profits earned from SEZ units under Section 10AA of the  Income Tax Act.
The matters for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 are pending  before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) Bengaluru.
For the matter of fiscal  2006, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has passed a partly favorable order .
The  order giving effect of said Commissioner Order is awaited.
The company is contesting the  demand and the Management including its tax advisors believes that its position will likely  be upheld in the appellate process.

2.23 S egment reporting The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end  business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance.
Effective year ended March  31, 2014, the Group reorganized its  business to strengthen its focus on growing existing client relationships  and increasing market share through service differentiation and  operational agility .
Consequent to the internal reorganization, there  were changes effected in the reportable industry segments based on the  'management approach' as laid down in AS 17, Segment reporting, and  an additional segment, Life Sciences and Healthcare was identified.
The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the Company's performance  and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance  indicators by industry classes and geographic segmentation of  customers.
Accordingly , segment information has been presented both  along industry classes and geographic segmentation of customers,  industry being the primary segment.
The accounting principles used  in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied  to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as  set out in the significant accounting policies.
Industry segments for the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial  Services and Insurance (FSI), enterprises in Manufacturing (MFG),  enterprises in the Energy & utilities, Communication and Services  (ECS), enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods and Logistics  (RCL), enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare (LSH).
Geographic  segmentation is based on business sourced from a particular geographic  region and delivered from both onsite and offshore locations.
North  Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 120 | Consolidated financial statements America comprises the United States of America, Canada and  Mexico, Europe includes continental Europe (both the east and the  west), Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the Rest of the World  comprising all other places except those mentioned above and India.
Consequent to the above change in the composition of reportable  industry segments, the prior year comparatives have been restated.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company's offshore software  development centers and onsite expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the  underlying assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes  that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those  costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately  disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of  the Group.
Fixed assets used in the Group's business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.
Accordingly , no disclosure relating to total segment assets and liabilities  are made.
Geographical information on revenue and industry revenue  information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in  relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

Kamath Chairman Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director R. Seshasayee Director Chennai April 24, 2015 Rajiv Bansal Chief Financial Officer Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 124 | Consolidated financial statements Our corporate governance philosophy We believe that it is imperative for us to manage our business affairs  in the most fair and transparent manner with a firm commitment  to our values.
For us, corporate governance is an ethically driven  business process that is committed to values aimed at enhancing  an organization's brand and reputation.
Our corporate governance  framework is a reflection of our culture, our policies, our relationship  with stakeholders and our commitment to values.
Accordingly ,  we always seek to ensure that our performance is driven by integrity .
This is vital to gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders.
Our corporate governance framework ensures effective engagement  with our stakeholders and helps us evolve with changing times.
The  publication of the Cadbury Report in the U.K. in 1992 was  a significant event in modern corporate governance.
The report  recommended the arrangement of company boards and accounting  systems to reduce corporate governance risks and failures.
The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, resulted in the senior  management individually certifying the accuracy of their company's  financial information.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act looks to build a safer, more stable financial  system to set the foundation for sound economic growth and job safety .
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) amended the  Listing Agreement effective October 1, 2014, to bring in additional  corporate governance norms for listed entities.
These norms provide  for stricter disclosures and protection of investor rights, including  equitable treatment for minority and foreign shareholders.
The amended rules required companies to get shareholders' approval  for related party transactions, establish whistleblower mechanisms,  elaborate disclosures on pay packages and have at least one woman  director on their boards.
The amended norms are aligned with the  provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and are aimed to encourage  companies to ‘adopt best practices on corporate governance’.
Our corporate governance framework has helped us be aligned  with the new guidelines of the Companies Act, 2013.
We believe  that an active, well-informed and independent board is necessary  to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.
At Infosys  (‘the Company’), the Board of Directors (‘the Board’) is at the core  of our corporate governance practice.
The Board thus oversees the  Infosys' Management's (‘the Management’) functions and protects the  long-term interests of our stakeholders.
Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make timely  disclosures and share accurate information regarding our financials  and performance, as well as the leadership and governance of  the Company .
Our corporate governance philosophy is based on the following  principles : • Corporate governance standards should satisfy both the spirit of the  law and the letter of the law • Ensure transparency and maintain a high level of disclosure • Clearly distinguish between personal conveniences and corporate  resources • Communicate externally , and truthfully , about how the Company  is run internally • Comply with the laws of all countries in which we operate • Have a simple and transparent corporate structure driven solely by  business needs • The Management is the trustee of the shareholders' capital and not  the owner.
We firmly believe that Board independence is essential to bring  objectivity and transparency in the management and in the dealings  of the Company .
As on March  31, 2015, the Board consists of  10 members out of which eight members are independent directors.
An independent director is nominated as the chairperson of each of the  audit, nomination and remuneration, stakeholders relationship, risk  and strategy and corporate social responsibility committees.
As part of our commitment to follow global best practices,  we  substantially comply with the Euroshareholders Corporate  Governance Guidelines 2000 and the recommendations of the  Conference Board Commission on Public Trusts and Private  Enterprises in the U.S. We also adhere to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) principles.
Corporate governance ratings CRISIL CRISIL has been consistently assigning us the ‘CRISIL Governance  and Value Creation (GVC) Level 1’ rating.
This GVC rating indicates  our capability to create wealth for all our stakeholders while adopting  sound corporate governance practices.
ICRA ICRA assigned the ‘Corporate Governance Rating (CGR) 1’ rating to  our practices.
The rating is the highest on ICRA's scale of CGR 1 to  CGR 6.
We are the first company in India to be assigned the highest  CGR by ICRA.
The rating reflects our transparent shareholding pattern,  sound Board practices, interactive decision-making process, high level  of transparency , disclosures encompassing all important aspects of  our operations and our excellent track record in investor servicing.
ICRA has also appreciated our Board composition as reasonably sized,  cohesive and articulate.
The rating also implies that we follow practices  that provide our financial stakeholders the highest level of assurance  on the quality of corporate governance.
Corporate governance guidelines Over the years, the Board has developed corporate governance  guidelines to help fulfill our corporate responsibility towards our  stakeholders.
These guidelines ensure that the Board will have  the necessary authority and processes to review and evaluate our  operations when required.
Further, these guidelines allow the Board  to make decisions that are independent of the Management.
The Board  may change these guidelines regularly to achieve our stated objectives.

• The CEO and MD is responsible for corporate strategy , brand  equity , planning, external contacts and all management matters.
He is also responsible for achieving the annual business targets and  acquisitions.
Definition of independent directors According to Section 2(47), 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and  the Rules thereunder, and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement with  Indian stock exchanges, an ‘independent director’ is a person who is  not a promoter or employee or one of the key managerial personnel  of the company or its subsidiaries.
The laws also state that the person  should not have a material pecuniary relationship or transactions with  the company or its subsidiaries, apart from receiving remuneration as  an independent director.
We are listed on NYSE in the U.S. We also  abide by the definition of an independent director as laid down in the  NYSE rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002.
Board membership criteria The nomination and remuneration committee works with the entire  Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experience  required for the Board as a whole and for individual members.
Board  members are expected to possess the required qualifications, integrity ,  expertise and experience for the position.
They should also possess  deep expertise and insights in sectors / areas relevant to the Company ,  and ability to contribute to the Company's growth.
The Company  shall not appoint or continue the employment of any person who has  attained the age of 60 years as Managing Director / Executive Director  and shall not appoint any person who has attained the age of 70 years  as independent director.
The term of the person holding this position  may be extended at the discretion of the committee beyond the age  of 60 years / 70 years with the approval of shareholders by passing  a special resolution based on the explanatory statement annexed to  the notice for such motion indicating the justification for extension  of appointment beyond 60 years / 70 years as the case may be.

Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 126 | Corporate governance report Selection of new directors The Board is responsible for the selection of new directors.
The Board  delegates the screening and selection process involved in selecting  new directors to the nomination and remuneration committee, which  consists exclusively of independent directors.
The nomination and  remuneration committee in turn makes recommendations to the Board  on the induction of any new directors.
Training of Board members All new non-executive directors inducted to the Board are introduced  to our Company culture through appropriate orientation sessions.
Presentations are made by various executive directors and senior  management to provide an overview of our operations, and to  familiarize the new non-executive directors with our operations.
They  are also introduced to our organization structure, our services, group  structure and subsidiaries, constitution, board procedures, matters  reserved for the Board, and our major risks and risk management  strategy .
The Board's policy is to have separate meetings regularly with  independent directors to update them on all business-related issues  and new initiatives.
At such meetings, the executive directors and  other members of the senior management share points of view and  leadership thoughts on relevant issues.
We also facilitate the continual education requirements of our directors.
Each director is entitled to a training fee of US $5,000 per annum.
Support is provided for independent directors if they choose to attend  educational programs in the areas of Board / corporate governance.
Membership term The Board constantly evaluates the contribution of the members  and periodically shares updates with the shareholders about  re-a ppointments consistent with applicable statutes.
The current  law in India mandates the retirement of two-third of the executive  board members (who are liable to retire by rotation) every year, and  qualifies the retiring members for re-appointment.
Executive directors  are appointed by the shareholders for the tenure of a maximum period  of five years, but are eligible for re-appointment upon completion of  their term.
An independent director shall hold office for a term of up to  five consecutive years on the board of the Company and will be eligible  for re-appointment on passing of a special resolution by the Company .
Mechanism for evaluating Board members One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review the  board evaluation framework.
The Board works with the nomination  and remuneration committee to lay down the evaluation criteria for  the performance of executive / non-executive / independent directors  through a peer-evaluation excluding the director being evaluated  through a Board effectiveness survey .
The questionnaire of the survey is  a key part of the process of reviewing the functioning and effectiveness  of the Board and for identifying possible paths for improvement.
Each  Board member is requested to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board  dynamics and relationships, information flow, decision-making of  the directors, relationship to stakeholders, company performance,  company strategy , and the effectiveness of the whole Board and its  various committees on a scale of one to five.
Feedback on each director  is encouraged to be provided as part of the survey .
Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and  guidance.
Some of the performance indicators based on which the  independent directors are evaluated include :  • Ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance  practices • Ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to  address top-management issues • Active participation in long-term strategic planning • Commitment to the fulfillment of a director's obligations and  fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board and  committee meetings.
Retirement policy For directors The age of retirement for all executive directors is 60 years.
The nomination and remuneration committee may , at its discretion  and subject to shareholders' approval, determine their continuation  as members of the Board upon superannuation / retirement.
The age of retirement for non-executive directors and independent  directors is 70 years.
Succession planning The nomination and remuneration committee works with the Board  on the leadership succession plan, and also prepares contingency plans  for succession in case of any exigencies.
Board compensation policy The nomination and remuneration committee determines and  recommends to the Board the compensation payable to directors.
All Board-level compensation is approved by the shareholders and  disclosed separately in the financial statements.
Remuneration  for the executive directors consists of a fixed component and a  variable component.
The nomination and remuneration committee  makes a half-yearly appraisal of the performance of the executive  directors based on a detailed performance-related matrix.
The annual  compensation of the executive directors is approved by the nomination  and remuneration committee, and placed before the shareholders at  the shareholders' meeting.
The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the Company is  entitled to an annual variable pay each fiscal year, which is subject to  the achievement of certain fiscal year milestones by the Company , as  determined by the Board (in its sole discretion).
The Board may reserve  the authority to set such milestones on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis.
The Chief Operating Officer of the Company is entitled to receive  payables at such intervals as decided by the Board.
The compensation payable to the independent directors is limited to  a fixed amount per year as determined and approved by the Board,  the sum of which does not exceed 1% of our net profits for the  year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.
The performance of the independent directors is reviewed by the  Board on an annual basis.

Independent directors are expected to attend at  least four Board meetings in a year.
However, with the Board being  represented by independent directors from various parts of the world,  it may not be possible for each one of them to be physically present  at all the meetings.
Hence, we use video / teleconferencing facilities to  enable their participation.
Committees of the Board usually meet the  day before the formal Board meeting, or whenever the need arises for  transacting business.

In India, Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement  makes it mandatory for listed companies to adopt an appropriate  audit committee charter.
The Blue Ribbon Committee set up by  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recommends  that every listed company adopt an audit committee charter.
This  recommendation has also been adopted by the NYSE.
The primary objective of the committee is to monitor and provide  an effective supervision of the Management's financial reporting  process, to ensure accurate and timely disclosures, with the highest  levels of transparency , integrity and quality of financial reporting.
The committee oversees the work carried out in the financial reporting  process by the Management, the internal auditors and the independent  auditors, and notes the processes and safeguards employed by each  of them.
The committee has the ultimate authority and responsibility  to select, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the independent  auditors in accordance with the law.
All possible measures must be  taken by the committee to ensure the objectivity and independence  of the independent auditors.
The audit committee charter is available on our website,   http://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/Pages/policies.aspx.

The Management is responsible for the Company's internal control  over financial reporting and the financial reporting process.
The  independent auditors are responsible for performing an  independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance  with the Generally Accepted Auditing Principles (GAAP), and for  issuing a report thereon.
The committee's responsibility is to monitor  these processes.
The committee is also responsible for overseeing the  processes related to financial reporting and information dissemination.
This is to ensure that the financial statements are true, fair, sufficient  and credible.
In addition, the committee recommends to the Board  the remuneration, appointment and terms of appointment of the  Company's internal and independent auditors.
In this context, the committee discussed the overall scope and plans for  the independent audit with the Company's auditors.
The Management  shared the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance  with the Indian GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards  (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  with the committee.
The committee discussed with the auditors,  in the absence of the Management (whenever necessary), regarding  the Company's audited financial statements, including the auditors'  judgment about the quality , not just the applicability , of the accounting  principles, the reasonableness of significant judgment and the clarity  of disclosures in the financial statements.
The committee also discussed other matters required by the Statement  on Auditing Standards No.
114, as amended (AICPA, Professional  Standards, Volume 1.
AU Section 380) – the auditor's communication  with those charged with governance, and by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  2002, with the auditors.
Relying on the review and discussions conducted with the Management  and the independent auditors, the committee believes that the  Company's financial statements are fairly presented in conformity  with Indian GAAP and IFRS.
The committee has also reviewed the internal control over financial  reporting put in place to ensure that the accounts of the Company  are properly maintained and that the accounting transactions are in  accordance with prevailing laws and regulations.
In conducting such  reviews, the committee found no material discrepancy or weakness in  the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The committee also reviewed the financial policies of the Company  and expressed its satisfaction with the same.
The Company's auditors provided written disclosures and a letter for  applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board to the committee.
This is regarding the auditor's communication  with the committee concerning independence, based on which the  committee discussed the auditors' independence with both the  Management and the auditors.
After the review, the committee  expressed its satisfaction on the independence of both the internal  and the independent auditors.
The committee also considered whether  any non-audit services provided by the independent audit firm could  impair such auditors' independence, and concluded that there were  no such services provided.
The committee secured compliance on the affirmation of the Board to  the NYSE and NYSE Euronext London and NYSE Euronext Paris under  the relevant rules of the exchanges on composition of the committee  and independence of the committee members, disclosures relating to  non-independent members, financial literacy and financial expertise  of members, and a review of the audit committee charter.

As part of our  corporate strategy, renew and new, we are vigorously  renewing our existing systems, and adopting innovations  across the economic, social and environmental  dimensions that not only benefit us but also our society.
From launching solutions that fuel socio-economic  progress, and pioneering new ways of making our  campuses more energy -efficient, t o enabling our  employees on Design Thinking, we are relying on our  culture of learning and education to amplify value for our  stakeholders.
All of this is detailed in our Business Responsibility Report  (BRR) for fiscal 2015.
We have been publishing the BRR  as part of our Annual Report since 2012.
The BRR follows  the National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs) on Social,  Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business,  as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA),  Government of India.
We also publish a comprehensive  Sustainability Report annually, independently assured  by Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL),  which follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4  framework and is available on our website,   http://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings.
At Infosys, it is of prime importance that our Company affairs are  transparent, ethical and driven by our core value system.
Our value  system, which is encapsulated as C-LIFE, comprises the following : • Client value : To surpass client expectations consistently • Leadership by example  : To set standards in our business and  transactions, and be an exemplar for the industry and ourselves • Integrity and transparency : To be ethical, sincere and open in all  our transactions • Fairness : To be objective and transaction-oriented, and thereby earn  trust and respect • Excellence  : To strive relentlessly and constantly to improve  ourselves, our teams, our services and our products, and to become  the best Corporate policies Our corporate governance practices, including ethics and  anti-corruption, apply across the Infosys Group, including our  suppliers and partners.
We firmly believe that following the highest  standards of business conduct and ethics helps us run our business  responsibly .
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics helps us maintain the  highest ethical standards for our employees.
It complies with the  legal requirements of applicable laws and regulations, including  anti-bribery , the ethical handling of conflicts of interest, and the fair,  accurate and timely disclosure of reports and documents that are filed  with the required regulatory bodies.
Every employee attends a session  on values during his or her induction, and acknowledges the Code of  Conduct and Ethics through a sign-up process.
Additional policies,  such as the Whistleblower Policy and Gift Policy , and the presence of a  strong grievance redressal body help us maintain an uncompromising  stand on value transgressions.
Enterprise risk management Our enterprise risk management is based on a custom framework —  PSPD : Pr edictability , Sustainability , Profitability , and De-risking —  which form the four cornerstones of our de-risked business model.
Through this framework, we identify , assess, monitor and mitigate  risks in the long, medium and short terms.
We have strong internal  audit processes that help us manage our risks strategically .
Refer to the Risk management report for more details.
Sustainability focus We believe that responsible business practices can not only lead to  economic progress for us, but also sustainable progress for all our  stakeholders.
Our sustainability strategy encompasses economic,  environmental and social imperatives, while paying attention to the  needs and expectations of our internal and external stakeholders.
Our leaders have been championing sustainability initiatives through  global forums and bodies.
We periodically communicate our progress  on material aspects concerning our stakeholders.
Regular discussions  and reviews with the Board and its committees, senior management  and other stakeholders across the organization help us work  consistently towards fulfilling the expectations of our direct and  indirect stakeholders.
Corporate social responsibility The Infosys Foundation and the Infosys Foundation USA are the  two trusts that have been created to take our CSR charter forward.
As per the Companies Act, 2013, all companies having a net worth  of ` 500  crore or more, or turnover of ` 1,000 cr ore or more, or a net  profit of ` 5 cr ore or more during any financial year will be required  to constitute a CSR committee of the Board of Directors comprising  three or more directors, at least one of whom will be an independent  director, and to have a CSR Policy approved by the Board.
Our CSR committee (‘the committee’) comprises K. V .
Kamath,  Chairperson; R. Seshasayee, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and  Dr. Vishal Sikka.
A comprehensive CSR Policy articulates our focus on (a) economic  development that positively impacts our society with a minimal  resource footprint, and (b) responsibility for our actions that affect  the environment, communities and stakeholders.
For more information, refer to our CSR Policy on our website,   www.infosys.com.
Commitment to responsible business Excellence Fairness Integrity and  transparenc y Leadership by example Client value C-LIFE We always strive to achieve the highest levels of responsible business.
While our corporate governance practices are fair and transparent,  we go beyond compliance.
The key dimensions of our corporate  governance framework are as follows : Board governance The Infosys Board of Directors (‘the Board’) has developed a robust  corporate governance framework to ensure that we conduct our  business responsibly .
The  appointments to the Board are made  by the nomination and remuneration committee of the Board.
The committee follows a core set of criteria based on the belief that  an active, diverse, well-informed and independent Board will ensure  the highest standards of corporate governance.
At Infosys, the Board  of Directors is at the core of our corporate governance practice and  oversees how the Management serves and protects the long-term  interests of our stakeholders.
As on March 31, 2015, the majority of  our Board members — eight out of 10 — are independent members.
We follow the best practice of nominating an independent director as  the chairperson of our committees such as the audit, Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR), nomination and remuneration, risk and strategy ,  and stakeholders relationship committees.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 144 | Commitment to responsible business We are a global leader in consulting, technology and outsourcing  solutions.
We help our clients in over 50 countries with our experience  and expertise so that they have an edge over their competitors and  serve their end-customers better.
Our responsibility towards a  sustainable value chain for our stakeholders is accomplished through  optimization, innovation and compliance.
Our renew and new  strategy envisages closer relationships with our  stakeholders to provide better and more optimized solutions through  automation and other cutting-edge technologies.
Our endeavor to  enrich the value chain of our clients has resulted in several innovative  solutions.
For instance, we adopted the engineering design methodology  and tools — typically used in manufacturing — to create a model heart.
The product that we built is now a valuable research and teaching aid,  which is helping save lives and bringing down the time required for  diagnosis and treatment.
We were among the first to make large-scale  use of light-weight advanced composites (instead of metal) to design  lighter planes for a client.
These airplanes — which burn 25% less  engine fuel — now lead the next generation of commercial aircraft.
Also, our cloud-based solution is enabling cars across the world to  communicate with one another and other devices, in readiness for a  world navigated by thinking, talking and intelligent automobiles.
Operational excellence through innovation We pursue operational excellence to ensure that our clients reap the  benefits of optimization.
This is done through a renewed impetus on  using the appropriate automation and intelligence tools internally and  for our clients.
We continue to make significant investments in quality  programs and initiatives that further drive operational efficiencies.
Some of the processes, frameworks and tool innovations developed  and deployed during fiscal 2015 are as follows : Infosys Continuous Integration Platform (ICIP) : This platform helps  project teams embrace agility , enhance overall application quality and  improve cycle time.
Infosys Transition Advantage (ITA) : ITA is a differentiating transition  management platform for seamless planning, execution and  governance across all phases of simple, complex, multi-tower and  multi-site transitions.
Program Management Center of Excellence (PgMCoE)  : Infosys' new  program management framework, ENRICH, is based on best practices  proposed by international program management standards and the  learnings derived from Infosys' vast experience in executing large and  complex programs.
Project Management Center of Excellence (PMCoE)  : PMCoE offers  value-added enablement and consulting services to Infosys' project  management community , to help achieve industry-leading project  management performance.
Requirement Elicitation and Analysis Framework (REAP)  : This  framework is being deployed to help establish accurate, complete and  unambiguous requirements in projects where clients are not clear on  the complete scope and require faster delivery .
Individual Productivity (IPr) Framework : As we continue to focus on  frameworks to drive process efficiencies, we rolled out a first-of-its-kind  framework to gauge efficiencies and effectiveness last year.
We have  seen considerable improvements in productivity levels, leading to  business benefits for both the organization and clients.
Infosys' Comprehensive Quality  approach : This approach looks  at each lifecycle stage as a phase where defects and issues can be  injected as well as detected by using methods and tools that allow for  measurable and objective perspectives on the quality of applications.
Be it application development or application maintenance, the  Comprehensive Quality approach provides unified processes and tools  to drive quality benefits.
Being a technology company , data security and privacy are two  important aspects of our value chain.
While we are an ISO 27001  certified company , we also comply with other industry-leading  standards as applicable.
Compliance on data security and privacy is  accomplished through a well set up governance framework.

Changing mindsets through Design Thinking As part of our renew and new strategy , we have embarked on a  path-breaking journey to impart a dT philosophy and change the way  our employees tackle solutioning for our clients.
We aim to attract  and retain the best global talent in the industry by creating a culture  of innovation, trust and empowerment among employees, along with  lifelong learning.
At the core of our strategy is the emphasis on bringing  about a cultural shift in thinking, mindshare and behaviors.
We have  collaborated with Stanford University's school of design, d.school,  to embark on dT workshops for our employees.
We believe that  the dT framework will change the way we investigate, innovate and  implement solutions for our clients, through a user-centric approach.
Our endeavor is to use dT to harness creative ideas, transform them  into solutions and take them to the market with skill, agility and  imagination.
While  the core management teams were the first to  participate in dT workshops, the program has been taken forward  to cover over 25,000 Infoscions globally .
Design Thinking has also  been introduced as a component in the Foundation Program for fresh  engineers.
As we are affecting a cultural transformation in the way we  look at problems so that we creatively come up with solutions through  a user-centric approach, dT has also been a life-enhancing skill for our  employees, as the learnings are not only applicable at the workplace,  but also in non-work-related spaces.
Boosting innovation ecosystems This year, we launched Murmuration — a unique, crowd-sourcing  idea generation initiative — across the organization, for a two-week  period.
We received 2,650 ideas from employees across locations and  business units.
The idea clusters included topics such as analytics,  automation, deep client engagement, moving to the cloud and digital  transformation.
A core leadership team evaluated each idea, and a  shortlist of 70 ideas was put up for rating by Infoscions.
This period  saw 1,31,847 page views and 31,466 actions (rating, commenting and  discussions) on the related portal.
The final shortlist of 10 ideas was  further strengthened by the idea authors and assigned mentors.
Some  of these have been taken forward for implementation.
Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Employee well-being | 147  A Global Hackathon was also organized to encourage rapid  problem-s olving through the use of technology , and boost the  ‘Maker Culture’ – an emerging learning methodology that encourages  shared social learning (hearing and seeing) by focusing on building  artifacts (doing), while also teaching the scientific methods of  experimentation, risk -taking and continuous improvement that are  critical to problem-finding, and then moving on to solving those  problems.
While our dT initiative enables us to identify relevant  problems, we believe that the Global Hackathons will supplement  this by allowing everyone to rapidly prototype possible solutions  to these problems.
The Hackathons were opened up under three  categories : • Open track : Participants were allowed to select a critical problem  of their choice and prototype solutions using open source or  proprietary technologies.
• Internal systems track : The participants had to identify and improve  on any aspect of Infosys' internal IT applications.
• Hardware track  : This unique track encouraged participants to  combine open source platforms with hardware sensors, to build  solutions in areas like Internet of Things.
Infoscions from 18  locations across the globe participated enthusiastically , and a host  of ideas emerged.
The Hackathon helped bring our innovation  mindset to the fore, and forged new interest and enthusiasm in  thinking differently and solving problems with agility and creativity .

Human rights Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Human rights | 151  As a responsible Company , it is our constant endeavor to not only  employ the best and most sustainable business practices, but also  set benchmarks for other organizations and society to follow.
We have identified climate change as a key operational risk, and  have targeted specific goals in the areas of energy efficiency , carbon  neutrality , water conservation, waste management and biodiversity .
Our Green Initiatives and Facilities teams work towards achieving  these stated goals.
Health, Safety and Environment Policy Our commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen demands  that we have a specific policy to ensure we take definite steps  to protect the environment, as this effort ranks high among our  corporate goals.
Our  HSE Policy is testimony to this effort, and  ensures that we constantly share best practices and provide a safe  and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors and visitors.
The policy is made available to all our employees worldwide on Sparsh  (our intranet), and through posters and instructions on digital and  physical display areas across our campuses.
Most of our campuses in India are ISO 14001:2004 certified, and  we have documented our objectives and targets at the corporate  and development center levels, which we monitor and track at  regular intervals.
We also implement operational controls for impact  management, based on severity .
Energy-efficiency strategies Infosys has set new benchmarks for energy performance in buildings  by implementing innovative technologies and building automation.
Focused efforts on smart building systems, retrofits, new building  designs with an efficient envelope, and renewable energy have  significantly reduced our energy consumption in the last seven years.
We continue to implement deep green retrofits in air conditioning,  UPS and lighting systems to achieve the highest-possible efficiency  levels and eliminate wastage.
In India, we have been largely successful  in leading from the front when it comes to implementing innovative,  energy-efficient technologies, and exploring innovative strategies in  this space.
‘Radiflux’ for cooling In India, we pioneered the use of radiant cooling technology for  office buildings through radiant slab and radiant panel-based cooling  systems, at our Hyderabad and Bengaluru campuses.
However,  when we realized that radiant panel-based cooling might not be  a cost-effective solution in India, we used high-quality engineering to  develop Radiflux radiant panels in-house, which use chilled water for  cooling.
These panels are twice as efficient as other products available  in the market, at one-third of the cost, and take 50% less time for  installation.
The Radiflux panels that we developed are more efficient, flexible  and easily replicable.
These can be deployed on a large scale, thus  leading the way for transforming how cooling is done in India.
These  panels ensure a lower first cost for the cooling system in new buildings,  and  a  cost-effective solution for retrofitting existing buildings to  achieve a high-efficiency cooling system.
Green buildings We were awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environment Design  (LEED) India Platinum rating for two of our buildings in Bengaluru  and Chennai, in fiscal 2015.
We now have 12 LEED Platinum-rated  buildings and two buildings with the Green Rating for Integrated  Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) 5 star rating, making it a total of about  3.8 million sq.
ft. of buildings having the highest level of green  certification, as on March 31, 2015.
Environment The LEED India Platinum-rated building in Bengaluru Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 152 | Environment Retrofits Our concentrated efforts to redesign and retrofit our existing  buildings have helped us achieve a dramatic reduction in connected  load and energy consumption.
The deep green retrofits in our air  conditioning and UPS systems have helped us achieve 13.5 MW  and 10.2 MW connected load reduction respectively in the last four  years.
In fiscal 2015 alone, air-conditioning retrofits have resulted in  a 3.4 MW reduction in the connected load.
Most retrofits have a short  payback period of less than three years and can be easily replicated in  other commercial buildings.
Adoption of renewable energy We have an ambitious goal to source 100% of our electricity  requirements from renewables by fiscal 2018.
In  fiscal 2015,  we installed rooftop solar power plants of 212 kWp at our Mangaluru  SEZ campus and 90 kWp at our Bengaluru campus, taking our current  total to 2.3 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) plants installed across our  campuses in India.
We are currently in the process of installing 15 MW  of solar PV plants across our campuses, including a 7 MW plant at  our Hyderabad campus.
We also source green power at some of our  development centers.
Building strategic partnerships We are constantly partnering with world-renowned organizations  to share and adopt global best practices and implement the latest  sustainable technologies at our new and existing buildings.
We currently  have strategic partnerships with the following organizations : • Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for PACE-R,  in a proposal for joint India-U.S. clean energy R&D.
PACE-R is  a joint clean energy research and development center with its  initial priorities in the areas of solar energy , building efficiency and  second-generation biofuels.

Our GHG emissions cover  Scope 1 emissions : fuel, hydr ochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), SF6 and  emissions from Company-owned vehicles; Scope 2 emissions  :   electricity , and Scope 3 emissions  : business travel, employee   commute, etc.
The calculations done for GHG emissions are based on  the guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and  Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the Indian Central Electricity  Authority (CEA), the U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food  and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), WBCSD, and the World Resources  Institute (WRI).
We monitor our emissions from the stacks connected to generators,  boilers and diesel-operated fire hydrant pumps, on a monthly basis.
There have been no deviations from the specified limits in fiscal 2015.
In addition, as our operations require the use of refrigerants in our  Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, which  have varied ODP , we have made a conscious effort to switch over to  refrigerants with a zero ODP .
Water management Our freshwater consumption is solely for the purpose of sustenance,  and our business activities do not have any significant impact on water  resources.
However, in an endeavor to become water sustainable,  we are committed to conserving and managing this scarce natural  resource, and have continued our focus on reducing our freshwater  consumption.
Our water management strategy includes an optimum  use of water across our campuses through water-efficient fixtures,  rainwater harvesting, recycling and reuse of waste water, and the  constant monitoring of our water consumption.
In fiscal 2015,  we installed smart water meters at many of our campuses to enable  the online monitoring of water consumption, and identify leakages,  wastage and opportunities for reduction.
Waste management We have been persistent in our efforts to ensure the reuse, recycling,  and responsible disposal of waste, to minimize the amount of waste  going to landfills.
Our focused approach towards waste management  has led us to establish annual targets to ensure an environment-friendly  disposal of waste in adherence to relevant legislations.
Our initiatives  are spread across three dimensions – influencing social behavior,  process optimization and the implementation of technology .
We have  installed technologies, such as biogas plants, to convert food waste  into biogas, organic waste converters to convert food and garden waste  into rich manure, and a vermi-composting system for paper waste,  among other initiatives.
Biodiversity Our biodiversity policy reflects our commitment to conserving and  promoting biodiversity across our campuses.
For instance, we ensure  that diverse species of trees that are native to the region are planted  across our campuses.
We also constantly motivate and sensitize our  employees on the need to protect and promote biodiversity , through  initiatives such as nature walks, sapling-plantation drives and other  awareness initiatives.
In addition, all our campuses in India are located on  government-approved land (in industrial zones) and comply with  the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests,  Government of India.
They also do not encroach on any protected or  high-biodiversity regions.
Eco advocacy and eco group activities We advocate positive sustainability actions among our employees  to encourage good citizenship behavior.
We sponsor and support  employee-run volunteer eco groups, which take up projects that  address sustainable living, conservation of electricity and water,  recycling of waste, reductions in carbon emissions and afforestation.
These groups also partner with the local communities around our  campuses to work on various sustainability-related initiatives.
Compliance We did not have any monetary or non-monetary sanctions imposed  on us for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations  during fiscal 2015.

Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Environment | 153  As a leading IT services company with global operations, we believe  that we must exercise our influence to create a better world around  us.
As responsible corporate citizens, our leaders and employees  participate in several industry associations and support advocacy  causes to encourage positive sustainability efforts.
Disclosures We practice transparent disclosures as one of our core values, and  we disclose aspects of the organization's performance and share our  best practices with all our stakeholders.
Our modes of disclosure are : • Publishing our financial reports, prepared according to the Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and IFRS (in the  Indian rupee and U.S. dollar terms).
We also publish the 20-F ,  according to the guidelines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) • Publishing our Business Responsibility Report and the Sustainability  Report annually , in adherence to international and national  guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework  and the National Voluntary Guidelines (NVGs) of the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India • Nominating ourselves for awards, assessments and ratings of  reputed national and international agencies Partnerships We forge strategic partnerships with industry bodies and consortiums  at the local, national and international levels.
Our advocacy efforts  are served by our senior leaders who are active members of several  such bodies.
In an effort to drive advocacy globally and locally , we have been part  of the governance bodies of national and international organizations  such as : • World Economic Forum (WEF) : The World Economic Forum was  held in January 2015 in Davos, Switzerland.
The theme this year  was, ‘The new global context’.
Dr. Vishal Sikka, CEO and MD of  Infosys, participated in this year's WEF along with several other  senior leaders of the Company .
Policy advocacy • GRI Focal Point India : After Infosys became the first IT Company  in the world to publish a sustainability report according to the GRI  G4 comprehensive guidelines in June 2014, GRI Focal Point India  invited Infosys to co-facilitate workshops both in India and across  global locations.
These workshops provided a learning opportunity  for beginners and practitioners embarking on the journey of  sustainability reporting.
Infosys also partnered with GRI to create a  learning document on the GRI G4 comprehensive guidelines.
• Advocating change through local partnerships : W e constantly work  towards creating strong local governance in cities where Infosys  campuses are located.
For example, we led the formation of the  Electronics City Industries Association (ELCIA) in Electronics City ,  Bengaluru, where our headquarters is located.
Electronics City was  declared an industrial township in February 2013 in recognition  of its outstanding work in the area of municipal administration.
We play a leadership role within the Electronics City Industrial  Township Authority (ELCITA) — the local municipality run and  managed by the industry — which manages all municipal functions  of the estate, including transport, security , estate management,  the development of infrastructure, water supply and solid waste  management.
ELCIA leads the industry body functions of the estate,  and is working on providing a fillip to electronics manufacturing  through the development of a common facilities center for  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), and a brownfield  cluster development project for Electronics System Design and  Manufacturing (ESDM).
This was envisaged to strengthen the  ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in India.
The ELCIA Trust  works towards the holistic development of local communities in the  areas of education, healthcare and the supply of fresh drinking water.

When we talk  about growing our business, we visualize an inclusive growth that improves the quality of life of our employees and of the larger community .
Our community development initiatives focus on education and the welfare of the underprivileged.
There are several modes through which  we implement our community development programs, including direct monetary support, organization-led projects, employee-driven initiatives  and our Community Empathy Policy .
In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, we spent ` 243 crore towards community development in  India during fiscal 2015.
Corporate social responsibility The Infosys Foundation (‘the Foundation’) was established in 1996 to support programs and organizations devoted to the cause of the economically  disadvantaged sections of society , particularly in the more inaccessible areas of India, and support need-based initiatives in locations where  we have significant operations.
Focus areas The highlights of the work done in this fiscal have been published in  the Foundation's report, available on our website, www .infosys.com/ infosys-foundation.
Since our largest market is the U.S., we set up the Infosys Foundation  USA to focus on supporting causes and initiatives in the areas of  education and technology inclusivity .
The Infosys Foundation  USA supports several leading science, technology , engineering and  mathematics (STEM) and community building initiatives, particularly  for under-represented communities.
Empowering through education Education is one of our priority areas, and we have channelized our  organization-led projects to promote primary , secondary and higher  education initiatives across the country , more particularly in remote  areas and among underprivileged sections.
We provide scholarships  to encourage students from rural India to pursue higher education,  fund infrastructure for government schools and train teaching staff in  schools and colleges.
We work closely with educational institutions  across the country to improve access to quality education in schools  and universities.
Campus Connect Campus Connect (CC), launched in May 2004, is a first-of-its-kind  industry-academia partnership program.
Through CC, we seek to  share some of our best practices with engineering colleges, thus  aligning the needs of institutions, faculty and students with those of  the IT industry .
This is one of the ways in which we hope to raise the  employability of our engineering students.
Besides classroom sessions, the CC program also organizes conclaves,  road shows at institutions, faculty enablement programs, industrial  visits for students and faculty , seminars and workshops, programming  contests for students, sabbaticals, technical events, research paper  sponsorships and soft-skills training for students and faculty members.
We also work with autonomous engineering institutions across the  country to co-create industry electives in foundational computer  science, soft skills and advanced topics such as business intelligence  and enterprise architecture.
Many of these co-created electives have  already been included in the curricula of these institutions.

SPARK – Rural Reach Program (RRP) This one-day program is aimed at creating awareness about computers  and the power of IT among rural schoolchildren in India.
The Infosys  Computer Donation program donates personal computers to schools  under the RRP program.
Based on the end-of-use earmarked for the  computers, the schools are also provided the necessary guidance for  the safe disposal of e-waste.
The target audience for the RRP comprises  students from rural government schools within a 50 km to 150 km  radius of our campuses.
Rural development HealthcareE ducation Destitute careCulture Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 Inclusive growth | 155  SPARK – Catch Them Young (CTY) CTY is a 10-day summer vacation program held on our campuses,  which aims to expose bright urban youth to the world of IT.
This program is targeted at meritorious students from the eighth grade,  who are selected through a test and are trained by faculty members  from our ETA department.
SPARK – Guru This program focuses on teachers from government schools and helps  them augment their knowledge and enhance their teaching skills with  respect to current industry needs.
As part of SPARK, we engaged with  over 38,460 students during the year.
Since its launch in 2008, the  program has reached over 9,16,460 students.
Promoting community empathy The Sabbatical Policy for Community Service, launched in October  2008, enables employees to take a break from work and participate in  and lead community development projects while continuing to receive  half their salary .
Further, our employees have the choice to return to  normal work schedules on the successful completion of the projects  within a time frame of six months to one year.
Till date, 47 employees  have availed of this sabbatical option, with over one-third of them  opting to work in the field of education.
Building responsible citizens I Citizen of Earth (iCOE) is an enabling platform to build social  leadership competencies in Infoscions.
As part of this initiative,  we rolled out the Infosys Framework for Learning Using External  Community Engagement (InFLUENCE), which proposes to recognize  the volunteering effort of our employees.
To facilitate CSR by our employees, all our campuses have CSR and  eco clubs that work on local issues.
Employees are encouraged to  volunteer their time and skills in social engagements of their choice.
The Clean India Campaign, officially launched by the Prime Minister  of India, Narendra Modi, on October 2, 2014, aims to accomplish  the vision of ‘A Clean India’ by October 2, 2019, the 150th birth  anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
While this campaign is making waves  across India, our employees are doing their bit as well.
Volunteer  programs have been rolled out across all our campuses, and currently ,  over 1,000 volunteers are part of this initiative.
Infosys Foundation  will be constructing toilets in 109 schools in and around Bhubaneswar  city as part of this program.

Infosys Annual Report 2014-15 156 | Inclusive growth Our clients are the ones who keep us in business and, therefore, they  are our most important stakeholders.
Through our renew and new   strategy , we aim to bring maximum benefit to our clients using our  expertise in innovation, and to be more relevant to their business.
Achieving excellence and client delight are our primary objectives  in our engagements with them.
This fiscal, many of our clients  participated in our Design Thinking workshops to identify end-user  problems and co-create innovative services and solutions.
We interact with our clients on a regular basis and across multiple  platforms.
We also host premier CXO-level events annually in Europe  and the Americas, which are specifically designed for our BPO clients  and for the banking clients of Finacle.
The forums that have been set up for engaging and building  relationships with our clients are as follows : • Client satisfaction surveys • Engagement Level Feedback (ELF) • Requests for proposals • Client visits and meetings • Quarterly business reviews • Sustainability portal on our website, www.infosys.com • Conclaves and workshops • Mailers, newsletters and brochures • Social media • Analyst meets Client satisfaction We have an active and robust strategy to receive feedback from  clients.
We also gather ‘feedforward’, as this allows us to understand  the client's expectations and needs, and helps us make the right  investment decisions.
Our annual Client Value Survey (CVS) and ELF help us take corrective  actions, gain insights and understand our clients better.
The survey  framework includes a structured questionnaire with a satisfaction  rating on a seven-point scale, encompassing close to 30 parameters,  with versions in English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish.
Feedback is collected through a web survey hosted by an  independent organization.
This helps ensure the confidentiality of  the information shared.
The survey elicits responses on the following aspects, and feedback  is clustered to allow us to deploy differential approaches to deliver  client value : • Expectation and fulfilment  : Top three expectations of CXOs and  senior-level respondents from Infosys, and their perception on  fulfilment • Client disposition  : Gauging the overall experience of working  with us • Business and technology priorities and expectations • Service-line feedback • Comparison against ‘best-of-breed’ firms  : Client-selected  benchmarks are preferred over ratings by a predetermined list  of firms The data gathered is analyzed statistically to classify clients into  core, moderate and breakaway groups.
The account teams use this  data to review their relationships with individual clients and design  interventions that create a positive and visible impact.
Client feedback score We have seen a notable improvement in the client feedback score this  fiscal compared to the previous one.
Overall, the index has improved  by 2.8 points, and we have seen an increase on all key parameters in  the areas of satisfaction, loyalty , advocacy and business value for spend.
Engagement Level Feedback Engagement Level Feedback is a more granular feedback mechanism  which goes deeper into the project-level engagement to gather  responses from clients.
It is a periodic survey that is conducted multiple  times during the course of a project.
The survey covers 14 different  parameters, including areas such as service delivery management, the  quality of products or services delivered, and behavioral competencies  of team members involved in the engagement.
Our Delivery and Quality teams come together to study and evaluate  set parameters during an engagement, with the aim of improving  the quality of deliverables and earning client satisfaction.
ELF is  also treated as the lead indicator in our annual CVS.
Based on the  account-level ELF , the client partner and the delivery anchor drive  improvement programs for the account.
Client complaints Our client-engagement process is well-structured, with defined  escalation levels and avenues to air and address grievances.
We have  a 'client complaints mechanism' that allows us to seek feedback from  our clients on an ongoing basis and communicate the resolution of  issues / complaints.
As on March 31, 2015, no stakeholder has filed any cases against the  Company nor are any cases pending regarding unfair trade practices,  irresponsible advertising and / or anti-competitive behavior during  the last five years.
Customer data privacy Since we deal with sensitive data that our clients entrust us with, data  privacy forms a key aspect of our sustainable value chain.
We have  stringent processes and practices to ensure that data privacy is  maintained at all times and under all circumstances.
A dedicated data  privacy group and the cross-functional Information Security Council  headed by a Board member ensure data privacy compliance in our  client engagements and the highest level of sponsorship for it.
As we  cater to client organizations from diverse industries, such as banking,  retail, telecom and the health sector, the scope of privacy and data  protection for the personal data of individual consumers is often  limited to contractual requirements agreed upon with our clients, and  subsequently deployed during project execution.
Our clients translate  applicable data protection laws into contractual requirements,  wherever appropriate.
In fiscal 2015, four incidents related to breach  of customer data privacy were reported.
T wo incidents related to data  leaks were reported.
All incidents have been addressed and closed.
