BEING INFOSYS.
BEING MORE.
ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16  BEING INFOSYS.
BEING MORE.
We inhabit a universe where time and space bend and  stretch continuously.
For us, the year in which we celebrated  the 100th anniversary of the Theory of General Relativity itself  appeared to warp, and passed by much too quickly.
It was a  year during which we focused on our strategy execution, and  we saw four quarters of healthy growth.
Beyond the financial  results, we saw unprecedented achievements by our teams in  every aspect of the business.
It was a year in which everyone  brought home the vision of Renew and New built on a solid  foundation of innovation, learning and purpose.
In this environment, it is easy to focus on the big picture,  and miss seeing the multi-dimensional manner in which  true transformation takes hold.
In order to return to market  leadership in a sustained manner, we need to re-imagine our  business in every facet and every detail.
From delivery, to sales,  consulting, operations, and each and every business enabling  function – from people, to processes, infrastructure and systems  – we have to bring about change that addresses the new reality  of a pervasively digital and inter-connected world.
This issue of our annual report celebrates the multiple facets  of our transformation.
The theme is about transcendence  from the ordinary.
It is about how innovation and continuous  improvement have permeated every corner of our business,  and about how we are honing excellence to a fine art form.
At Infosys, it is no longer adequate to simply meet expectations  – we have to exceed it every time, and in every way.
Today, being Infosys means being more.
80,000+ employees and several clients have been trained in Design Thinking, which  inculcates a culture of empathy and problem finding.
It fosters rapid learning by  making and by iterative solution development.
MORE THAN SEEING AND HEARING.
LISTENING, MAKING AND IMPROVING.
The second edition of the Infosys Global Hackathon, Bangalore campus.

Technology is  reshaping our world in a fundamental way  : new  CPUs fr om Intel built on 14 nanometer processor  technology deliver unprecedented performance  and analysts recently reported that hardware unit  sales for cloud are approaching those for enterprise.
Technology companies are making cars and watches,  and creating new kinds of transportation, hospitality,  retail, insurance, and other services, disrupting entire  industries.
And recently, a fleet of driverless trucks  made by various vendors, drove thousands of miles  across Europe, demonstrating vividly that the end of  a key job category is upon us.
The world of our future  looks vastly different from what we see today – an  increasingly digital world, a deeply connected world,  a collaborative world.
It was clear nearly two years ago, and today it is  starkly clear, that given this digital transformation  of our world, the traditional services industry of the  past, in which we compete to do the same work  cheaper but with world-class quality, must also  transform.
A  services company must be more, and  we, Infoscions, as individuals and as a company,  must be more.
We must instead become a company  that delivers value and innovation.
Our context has  fundamentally, and irreversibly, changed, and we  cannot go back to the approaches and methods of  the past.
The imperatives, and the opportunities,  are clear.
It is with this new reality in mind that we embraced  three simple ideas in our strategy  : r enew ourselves  and help our clients renew their businesses; drive  innovation and new opportunities in our business  and with our clients; and do all of this based on a  culture of education and collaboration.
Indeed,  when we think about it, this blueprint applies to all  businesses.
Renew is about being better.
Better than we have  been.
Automation is a key part of this.
It is how  we improve solutions to the known, well-defined  problems and improve the businesses we are already  in.
It is about driving grassroots innovation in every  project and in every service.
The repetitive tasks  can be automated by bringing Artificial Intelligence  to our existing services and existing customer  landscapes, so that we fundamentally transform cost  and productivity.
And we set a lofty benchmark for  this  : if we have done something once, we should not  do it again.
It can be automated.
New is about being dif ferent.
This is the breakthrough  innovation.
It is about finding problems that we  don’t easily have words to describe, that no one  has defined.
It is the unknown problems.
It is about  leveraging automation to digitize our physical world,  and using Design Thinking to focus on the empathy,  the problem-finding, which uncovers new markets,  for us and for our clients.
Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 And our Culture is all about education.
It is staying  true to who we are.
It is the idea of ‘being improving’,  where we constantly build upon what we already  know.
Education is how we drive our strategy – it  helps us learn new techniques to automate the  things we understand, and it gives us the mindset  to discover the things that we do not yet know.
It is  how we work.
It is not the innovation lab that drives  all the big ideas, it is to enable and empower every  Infoscion to be an innovator.
This bedrock of our  culture, this learnability – as Mr. Murthy always said,  to me, and to all of us – an ability to learn, is as true  and critical for our future as it has ever been.
On AI specifically, people often ask me if all this  automation, this AI, will lead to human obsolescence,  and the elimination of jobs.
It is my emphatic view,  having studied AI at the feet of some of its great  pioneers, that this is not the case.
AI, like all great  technologies and tools that have come before it,  can and should amplify people – enabling us to  focus on the creative work, the imaginative work.
The driverless trucks that I  mentioned did things  we humans simply cannot do, e.g.
‘platooning’; we  don’t have the mechanical precision or the reflexes  for it; we do, however, have the imagination and the  knowledge to build the software and systems for  driverless trucks, and to govern their safe operation.
Technology can and must be the great amplifier of  our human potential, our humanity.
It is why we focus  on education and learning; it is why we participate in  OpenAI and other initiatives to develop and advance  AI openly, to help bring its benefits to all of us.
It has been more than one year since we outlined  this Renew and New strategy for consistent and  profitable growth of the company.
I am happy to  share with you the progress we have made so far on  the execution of our strategy.
In the financial year 2016, our revenues grew in  rupee terms by 17.1% to `  62,441 cr ore.
In dollar  terms, our revenues grew during the year by 9.1%  to US  $9,501 million and in constant curr ency terms,  revenues grew by 13.3%.
For the financial year 2016,  our operating profit margin was 25.0% and net profit  margin was 21.6%.
During the year, earnings per  share grew by 9.4% in rupee terms and 1.9% in dollar  terms.
Our operating cash flows were healthy during  the year and we ended the year with liquid assets of  US  $5,202 million ( `  34,468 cr ore).
We focused on effective strategy execution during the  year, and I am happy to report that several indicators  of strategy execution have improved.
For example,  our large deal wins have improved significantly  during the year, demonstrating, I  believe, that the  renewal of our existing core services, together with  all the new things we can bring, are helping us to  differentiate on value, not cost.
The total contract  value of large deals won during the year increased by  45% to US  $2.8 billion this year .
Similarly, due to our  focused client engagement and value creation, the  revenue from top clients improved during the year.
Top 10 clients grew by 12.3% in constant currency  and top 25 clients grew by 9.3% in constant currency  for the year.
The measures that we deployed to  deepen employee engagement have begun to show  results, with attrition coming down to 13.6% this year  from 18.9% last year.
Our efforts towards increase in per capita revenue  improvement through productivity improvement  and automation are in early stages.
During the year,  we released nearly 4,000 full-time employees from  projects as a result of automation of underlying  services.
We  will continue to focus on this crucial  front.
We have several additional levers to further  enhance operational efficiency, such as utilization,  onsite effort mix, onsite employee cost and sub- contractor expenses, which we plan to optimize.
Behind these numbers is the work of several  transformational initiatives that Pravin and I started  over the last 21 months.
We set out to renew and  bring entirely new ideas to everything – from our  processes, to training and curriculum, to marketing,  to onboarding, to large deals, to the bench, to our  ecosystem, and more.
And the results we see are  many of these initiatives beginning to take hold and  flourish.
We see this in the renewal of ourselves internally,  to drive innovation and create value.
I am most  proud of initiatives such as Zero Distance, in which  the teams working in more than 7,000 master  projects at Infosys have found and continue to  find incremental innovation – looking beyond the  SOW, to add value.
With this initiative, under the  passionate leadership of Ravi, our delivery teams  learn and live being innovators rather than order- takers.
Our  work on this is not done, and in the  coming year, I look forward to taking our grassroots  innovation to new levels.
From BPO to Product  Engineering, from Business Intelligence to Digital,  from Application Development and Maintenance to  Cloud Infrastructure Services, we have embarked on  a great renewal of all of our services with automation  and pervasive grassroots innovation, founded on a  culture of collaboration and openness.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Letter to the stakeholder | 03  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 04 | Letter to the stakeholder We have trained over 80,000 employees in Design  Thinking, in what is surely the largest ever corporate  training program for Design Thinking.
It is about  building creative confidence, as David Kelley  describes it, in every Infoscion.
About learning to ask  questions, to challenge the status quo, to look inside  the work we are doing and find new problems to  solve.
Going forward, we will bring Design Thinking  to every facet of our work; it will help us deploy our  bandwidth that automation helps us save towards  innovation and value-creation for clients and for us;  and it will help us engage our clients in their most  strategic areas – areas we have rarely worked in.
We introduced Zero Bench in July 2015, an initiative  to eradicate the bench – a construct of our industry  that, 21 months later, I still cannot accept – from our  company and our industry, creating a marketplace  inside Infosys so that people awaiting longer-term  assignments continue to add value to Infosys and  our clients.
In just nine months, by the end of the  financial year 2016, more than 12,000 jobs had been  created on our Zero Bench marketplace, and more  than 67% of folks on the bench had completed at  least one of these!
We improved employee engagement, creating a  new performance management system in which  managers provide continuous feedback and  an ongoing dialog about performance.
We are  improving our processes, slowly but surely to ease  the way employees work.
We ourselves are one of  the first users of Infosys Mana, to automate and  simplify our mission-critical travel process.
And we  are investing in employees, not just in training, skills  development and the overall employee experience,  but investing to drive retention and attract the  best leaders through the new stock incentive plan  for employees.
We are also investing in the Virtual  Global Delivery Model, and in our workspaces, to  help further our teams’ ability to collaborate and to  deliver value to clients across boundaries.
In all of these things, I want to point out our efforts  in developing a culture of collaboration, with Zero  Distance as a great example of many, such as the  tremendous work of our finance team under the  leadership of my colleague and friend Ranga – the  leader of a world-class finance organization which is  both improving our processes and our collaboration,  while upholding the utmost standards of governance  and compliance set by our founders.
Collaboration  makes us exponentially more powerful and faster.
Competition, on the other hand, a very human  tendency of ours, is best when aimed at competing  with our past selves, the way we used to be, rather  than looking backwards towards others.
I believe this  leverage of collaboration and competition can best  help us create the company we aspire to be, even  while competitors increasingly emulate us.
I believe these internal efforts to renew and bring  innovation have led to the steep decline in attrition  compared to where we were two years ago.
While  our work to build an extraordinary workplace for  Infoscions as innovators is far from done, these  are good signs.
When I walk around our beautiful  campuses, and feel the energy of many reinvigorated  Infoscions, when I listen to the passion in the voice,  and the glint in the eyes of a 31-year-old project  manager beaming with a Zero Distance idea, more  than any of the numbers, I feel reassured that we are  on the right path.
Turning to what and how we deliver to our clients – we  took big steps in the financial year 2016 by bringing a  combination of automation and innovation, powered  by education, to clients, and are now building on  this work.
We launched our Aikidō service offerings, renewing  our existing service lines and introducing new types  of services.
In Aikidō, we are helping our clients  capture the knowledge and know-how and renew  their organizations (Ki); leverage open, intelligent  platforms to drive new opportunities through new  kinds of applications (Ai); and bring design-led  services that help clients find their most important  problems to solve with Design Thinking (Dō).
And now bringing these services together with our  Infosys Mana platform, our purposeful approach to  AI, we can help our clients reinvent the continual  reinvention of their system landscapes.
We can  lower the cost of maintenance for both physical and  digital systems; capture the know-how of people  and fragmented and complex systems across  generations; simplify the continuous renovation of  core business processes; and enable businesses  to bring new and delightful experiences to their  customers and end-users.
We refocused consulting to be the tip of our spear,  and as part of this charter, I am pleased to see Design  Thinking as a key fabric of our work, making its way  into each and every client engagement.
We brought the Infosys Information Platform  (IIP) to clients in a big way, and created entirely  new opportunities resulting in discussions or  implementations for more than 200 clients using our  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 open, intelligent cloud-based analytics platform,  to define breakthrough solutions from their diverse  data sources.
Both IIP and IAP are now a part of the  broader Mana platform.
Our EdgeVerve subsidiary  continues to lead our all-important software front.
Panaya, Skava and EdgeVerve continued to add  value for our clients and for us.
Our philosophy of  organic first, then external hiring, then investments,  and then mergers and acquisitions is, I believe, the  right balance for Infosys.
Under Ritika’s leadership,  we made several investments, and three acquisitions.
On investments, we will continue to carefully deploy  our capital on innovative companies that are  inventing the future.
On acquisitions, we will continue  to consider companies that help us advance our  cause, and where there is a matching of purpose and  passion; we will not buy revenue or ‘market share’ in  markets of yesterday.
And as importantly as the work we do with clients  and internally, we continued to have a deep focus  on contributing to the world around us, in our  communities, in the proud and yet humble work we  do through our foundations.
Our Infosys Foundation,  led by the exemplary Mrs. Murty, continued to set  new standards in bringing help to those in need  across a wide spectrum of needs and regions in  India.
The Infosys Science Foundation, a purposeful  support of the advances in basic sciences that our  founders have so passionately believed in and led,  has continued its great work.
And our young Infosys  Foundation USA, which under Vandana’s leadership  emerged, in the words of the White House Office of  Science and Technology Policy’s senior advisor, is  already becoming a force, reaching out to as many  people as possible in the all-important frontiers  of bringing computer science education and  making  to  all.
And on a larger scale, our amazing  facilities team led by the incomparable Ramadas  Kamath broke new grounds and new frontiers in  sustainability and innovation – including moving our  Hyderabad campus completely off the grid, a solar  powered campus serving 15,000+ Infoscions!
And yet, as we look ahead, we can clearly see that  we are barely at the start of where we need to go.
Like any large-scale transformation, metamorphosis  – as our Chairman Sesh, who took over this year  from my mentor and the quintessential leader- entrepreneur Mr. Kamath, calls it – will take time.
We have started to implement the changes that will  drive our transformation.
But it cannot be the valiant  efforts of a few warriors within Infosys.
The  world  as we knew it has been transformed.
Add to this  the extreme cost pressure on our clients due to the  disruptions they face, including entirely new types  of competitors, and in turn, the pricing pressure this  brings to the services industry.
We must massively  scale our innovation and drive our strategy in every  aspect in our company.
All of you, our stakeholders,  some of whom have been with us for many years, are  an integral part of our journey, in empowering our  people and our company to be more.
If we can execute our strategy, and do the things we  must learn to do, the year, and the years, ahead of us  could be deeply rewarding, and I look forward to a  great journey ahead, together.
Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director Letter to the stakeholder | 05 06 | So we may Be More SO WE MAY BE MORE These times of being digital that we live in are  also times when all things around us are becoming  services.
As a services company, we are particularly  well-suited to thrive by creating amazing  experiences.
And it only stands to reason that we  use this advantage to improve the way we serve, not  just our clients, but also ourselves – by enhancing our  experience at work.
About a year ago, we started on a journey of renewal  to simplify our key processes, systems and policies.
We wanted the employee experience at Infosys  to be not only empowering but truly delightful.
We  approached this transformation guided by the  tenets of Design Thinking, which teaches us that  any service has three underlying components  :  desirability – how well it addr esses the most pressing  needs of end - users; feasibility – how well the service  is orchestrated; and finally, viability – the economic  benefits of delivering the service.
A highly motivated  team of our employee volunteers, governed by a  central project management office, took up the task  of driving this service metamorphosis.
The annual employee satisfaction survey pointed  out where the biggest opportunities for change lay.
Needless process complexity, lack of end - to - end  process ownership, undue delays in cross-functional  processes, poor application user interface, manual  interventions that could easily be automated, were  the challenges at hand.
The team catalyzed more  than 200 changes in over 15 processes – including  those related to travel, claims and reimbursement,  and project management.
The Bell Curve - inspired  Comparative Relative Ranking (CRR) was eased out  of the performance evaluation process.
The company  dress-code was made more employee - friendly too.
Not surprisingly, these improvements reflected in  surging satisfaction scores in employee surveys and  a drop in our attrition numbers from 18.9% to 13.6%  through the past year.
The journey of getting better at being better did not  stop there.
Not satisfied with merely improving the  existing environment, we set out to simultaneously  re-imagine the policy and process landscape and  create fundamental simplification at Infosys.
Code- named Process++, a program was launched in late  2015 to rethink our systems and achieve radical  optimization and efficiencies, reduction in cycle time,  increased data flow and improved user experience  by leveraging smart technology and next-generation  analytics, while remaining uncompromising on  governance and compliance.
Global Mobility,  Order to Remittance, Procure to Pay, and Claims  Management were some of the enterprise processes  targeted for deep simplification.
In early 2016, we launched Optiwise, a grounds-up  movement to involve employees in bringing positive  change within Infosys.
Optiwise invites employees to  share ideas to (a) save cost and / or effort, (b) reduce  waste, and (c) increase productivity.
Over 2,000 ideas  have come in from all over the globe, and over 250  have been identified for implementation on priority.
This journey embodies the spirit of our strategy  of continuous renewal to remain relevant through  changing times.
But renewal by itself is not enough,  we must also do completely new things so that we  may thrive in disruptive times.
We are becoming  better at solving fundamental problems and, in  doing so, we are creating more exciting, and richer,  experiences for our own people, and for our clients.

MAKING IT REAL.
Adding the Infosys touch to shape  the future This is my 16th year in Infosys and it has been  extraordinary!
We have worked on a spectrum of  initiatives to sharpen and strengthen our traditional  service lines while curating brand new ones.
We have  onboarded top talent and done all this while being  focused on execution and innovation for our clients.
The role of technology in the financial services  industry has never been more important, and the  threat of disruption by new entrants has never  Mohit Joshi President and Global Head – Financial Services been more real.
Our clients are focused on digital  transformation, on greater efficiency through  industrialization, and on meeting the regulatory  and compliance agenda.
We  have historically built  a superb execution engine and tied it to deep  domain and consulting capabilities in the sector.
In the past 18 months, we have built and acquired  tremendous capabilities in automation and artificial  intelligence with Mana, in data management with IIP ,  and we now offer comprehensive digital platforms  through EdgeVerve and Skava.
We have worked with  the fintech community to build a deep ecosystem  to lead the innovation agenda for our clients and  have helped our clients imagine the future with  Design Thinking.
All these together offer our clients  an opportunity to shape the future of the financial  services industry through technology.
Throughout the history of this company, our leaders  have spoken about purpose – it is the glue that binds  all our stakeholders and connects us to the broader  community.
It has given the company a sense of  self and a touchstone when vital decisions have to  be made.
Our strategy of Renew and New, with a  strong underpinning of an empowering culture,  has revitalized this purposefulness.
This is reflected  in an enormous upsurge in client and employee  engagement and enthusiasm.
I have no doubt  that it has also helped us deliver better financial  performance.

knowledge-enabled enterprise to straight -through  and touchless pr ocessing of everything they do in an  agile, automated, seamlessly connected landscape  designed to amplify human potential.
At Infosys, we’ve been innovating from the grassroots  up, to create a future such as this.
For us, innovation  is a quest for a client problem that is unknown or  unarticulated.
It is also about finding surprisingly  smart ways to solve a known problem.
We employ  a simple framework – Zero Distance – to first spot  and then resolve these problems.
The framework  encourages our people to look and learn from  others.
To find opportunities to improve efficiencies  or create new value.
To articulate the value of these  ideas in clear business terms.
And, most importantly,  to then share the knowledge with others.
Because it  is only through collaboration that we will achieve our  aspirations while also nurturing a culture of lifelong  learning.
It is the only way forward – with us looking  around to understand the best thinking, applying  that knowledge to improve our work, and everyone  around helping us do this.
Only then might we do  more, be more, and reap its rewards, in the year  ahead and beyond.

Top-line Growth  : The Infosys Information Platform,  I informed him, had the power to generate deep  insights – for example, the capability to pr edict  ‘out of stocks’ at select retail stores every Thursday  where he wouldn’t ordinarily replenish the inventory  until Monday, empowering him to act quickly on the  insights.
Business Model Reinvention  : ‘Skava’ is a terrific  platform for its ability to cr eate differentiated  immersive digital experiences online, on mobile,  with virtual reality and in-store, driving completely  new business models for this client.
N. R. Narayana Murthy once said, “Strategy is  differentiation”.
Infosys has in recent times found  new offerings organically and inorganically to  differentiate itself by addressing all the strategic  objectives of our client CXOs.
Most importantly,  Infosys is willing to partner with this client on the  business outcomes.
I have been with Infosys now for over 15 years.
We have always prided ourselves on differentiation  and earning respect from all stakeholders – respect  for our strategy and recommendations, respect for  our values, and respect for the relevance of our  offerings.
This is the Infosys I am proud of.

Employees’ stock options / Restricted stock units 2015 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan The shareholders approved the issuance of stock incentives to the  employees of the Company and its subsidiaries under the 2015  Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (‘the 2015 Plan’) in the recently  concluded postal ballot on March  31, 2016.
The 2015 plan is  in compliance with the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits)  Regulations, 2014 and the details are also available on our website  (https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance).
The purpose  of the 2015 Plan is to  : •  Attract, r etain and motivate talented and critical employees; •  Encourage employees to align individual performance with   Company objectives; and •  Rewar d employee performance with ownership.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 24 | Board’s report The 2015 Plan provides for stock incentives to eligible employees such  as Restricted Stock Units (RSU) and stock options (together ‘Stock  Incentives’).
Subject to applicable law and conditions for exercise,  eligible employees are entitled to receive equity shares, American  Depositary Receipts (ADRs) or cash on exercise of the Stock Incentives.
The Stock Incentives vest over a period of four years from the date of  the grant, or such other period as decided in the sole discretion by the  Administrator.
The 2015 Plan shall be administered by the nomination  and remuneration committee of the Board constituted by the Company  pursuant to the provisions of Section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013  (‘the Administrator’).
The Administrator’s decisions, determinations,  and interpretations will be final and binding on all eligible employees  and participants under the 2015 Plan.
Each Stock Incentive shall be  evidenced by an award agreement that will specify such terms and  conditions as the Administrator will determine, including whether the  eligible employees will get equity shares of the Company , ADRs of the  Company or cash on exercise of the Stock Incentives.
The Board had, in October 2015, recommended that the Company  create a pool of up to 2% of the shares outstanding towards the  2015 Plan for employees of the Company .
The Management  has recommended to the Board that a budget of 1% of the shares  outstanding be allocated at this time to the needs of the Plan,  amounting to approximately 2,40,38,883 equity shares.
This 1%  pool includes 1,12,23,576 treasury shares of the Company that are  currently held in trust towards the 2011 RSU Plan.
Consequently ,  an additional 1,28,15,307 equity shares, amounting to 0.56% of the  shares outstanding, will be required to be set aside for the 2015 Plan.
We expect the pool of 2,40,38,883 shares to be granted over a period  of four to seven years.
To calculate the employee compensation cost, the Company uses the  Fair Value Method for the valuation of the Stock Incentives granted.
The exercise price for the restricted stock units will be equal to the  par value of the shares and the exercise price of stock options would  be market price as on the date of the grant.
The total number of equity shares and ADRs to be allotted pursuant  to the exercise of the Stock Incentives under the 2015 Plan to the  employees of the Company and its subsidiaries shall not cumulatively  exceed 2,40,38,883 equity shares (approximately 1% of the issued  capital) of which 1,70,38,883 shares will be issued as RSUs at par  value (including shares currently held under the RSU 2011 Plan  amounting to 1,12,23,576 equity shares) and 70,00,000 will be issued  as stock options at market price.
The mix of RSUs, options or other  equity rights under the Plan may be adjusted in the sole determination  of the Administrator from time to time.
In June 2015, the Company , based on the recommendation of the  nomination and remuneration committee, made a grant of 1,24,061  RSUs to Dr. Vishal Sikka.
The grant price was ` 5 per RSU and the  RSUs  would vest subject to the achievement of certain key performance  indicators as set forth in the award agreement for each applicable  year of the vesting tranche and continued employment through each  vesting date.
Further, the award granted to Dr. Vishal Sikka on June 22,  2015 was modified by the nomination and remuneration committee  on April 14, 2016.
There is no modification or change in the total  number of RSUs granted or the vesting period (which is four years).
The modifications relate to the criteria of vesting for each of the years.
Based on the modification, the first tranche of the RSUs will vest  subject to achievement of certain key performance indicators for the  year ended March 31, 2016.
During fiscal 2016, Dr. Vishal Sikka exercised 10,824 options and held  2,21,505 options outstanding as on March 31, 2016.
The details of the employee stock options / RSU plan form part of the  Notes to accounts of the financial statements in this Annual Report.

Our CSR responsibilities We hereby affirm that the CSR Policy , as approved by the Board, has been implemented and the CSR committee monitors the implementation  of the projects and activities in compliance with our CSR objectives.
Bangalore  April 15, 2016 R. Seshasayee Chairperson, CSR Committee  Dr. Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Annexures to the Board’s report | 59  Annexure 8 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology absorption,  foreign exchange earnings and outgo Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 Conservation of resources Doing more with less – Infosys believes in conservation of energy  and resources to help create a better tomorrow.
With our smart  building automation, highly-efficient building designs, deep green  retrofits and renewable energy , we are well on the path to achieving  carbon neutrality .
Our Central Command Centre in Bangalore now  manages about 45 million sq.
ft. of built-up area.
The Mysore campus  is a shining example of sustainable development through resource  conservation and is a model smart city .
Use of innovative water-efficient  technologies, 100% recycling and reuse of wastewater, and setting up  of recharge wells and lakes for groundwater recharge have helped us  achieve significant water savings.
Persistent efforts in managing our  waste effectively and scientifically is getting us close to our goal of  minimizing waste-to-landfills.
Renewable energy In fiscal 2016, we installed solar power plants of 9.7 MW in different  campuses in India, taking our total installed capacity to about 12 MW  of solar power.
One of our greatest achievements this year has been the  addition of enough solar power generating capacity in our Hyderabad  SEZ campus to make it 100% captive RE.Green buildings   This fiscal, we were awarded the LEED India Platinum rating for two of  our buildings in Pune and Bangalore, and Green Rating for Integrated  Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) for our building in Hyderabad.
We now  have 14 LEED Platinum-rated buildings and four buildings with  GRIHA five-star rating.
Retrofits The deep green retrofits in air-conditioning and UPS systems have  helped us achieve 16 MW and 12 MW reductions, respectively  in connected load in the last five years.
In fiscal 2016 alone,  air - conditioning retrofits have led to about 2.5 MW reduction in  connected load.
Carbon neutrality Following our commitment to become carbon neutral, we have started  three carbon offset projects – a household biogas project and two  biomass cook stove projects – which will together generate nearly 30%  of our carbon offset requirement in 2017-18.Water management All our new buildings are designed with the most optimal standard  of fresh water requirement, that is, 16 liters per capita per day , which  is nearly 65% lower than the standard prescribed in the National  Building Code.
Our extensive smart water metering program has  helped us plug leakages and save significant quantities of water.
With  persistent efforts to conserve rainwater, we have 149 recharge wells  and 25 lakes recharging groundwater across campuses.
Waste management  We have strived to ensure reuse, recycling and responsible disposal of  waste.
This year, we installed biogas plants with a cumulative capacity  of nearly 5.5 tons per day (TPD) in different campuses to convert food  waste into biogas.
The biogas generated is used in our food court  kitchens.
This will help us save about 300 kg of cooking gas (LPG)  per day .
Biodiversity  We make every effort to conserve and promote biodiversity at all our  owned facilities.
We planted over 80,000 saplings this year.
The total  number of saplings planted in our campuses in the last eight years is  now over 5,00,000.
For more information on environment conservation efforts, refer to  ‘Environment’ section in the Business Responsibility Report.
Health, safety and environment Environmental sustainability is a business imperative at Infosys.
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace to our  employees, consultants and contractors and achieving high standards  of environmental protection.
Recognizing climate change as a major  risk to our planet, we have integrated climate change actions into the  Company strategy .
Our Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS),  called Ozone, helps to provide a secure environment for our employees,  assets and operations.
The initiative also strives to keep employees,  contractors and others well-informed, trained and committed to our  HSE process.
For more information, refer to ‘Employee well-being’ in  the Business Responsibility Report.
Technology absorption Transforming digital business engine of Infosys IT The Infosys digital business engine comprises over 250 closely  integrated applications centrally hosted in multiple data centers with  more than 2,000 physical and virtual servers, over four petabytes  of storage, over 125 million files, and heterogeneous technology  platforms.
As part of our Renew and New strategy , we are transforming our digital  business engine by deploying the following initiatives  : Next-generation  flash storage  :  We deployed next-generation flash  storage with inline compression capability in production database  clusters resulting in TCO reduction by enabling 4x capacity within  existing rack space and over 75% savings on power and cooling  requirements per TB of storage volume.
Global Active Device (GAD)  :  We deployed Hitachi GAD in the  production database cluster.
This has helped us reduce provisioning  and configuration complexity of the cluster, and enhanced our data  center-level disaster recovery solution.
Work from home  :  As per the earlier policy , only Infoscions who had  an office laptop with a Secure ID or a Digipass reader could work from  home.
In circumstances like natural calamities, catastrophes like the  Chennai floods or during political unrest / strikes, those Infoscions  who had no way of connecting to their office desktops were forced  to take leave.
Our mission was to enable ‘Work from home for all’.
Conventional  solutions like VDI required significant investments and complex  change management across 1,00,000+ end points.
We designed an  innovative, secure and intuitive solution with a one-time investment  of just US  $3 per user that enables 68,000+ Infoscions who only   have official desktop to remotely connect from home through their  personal devices.
We published virtual application (MSTSC or Remote  Desktop Connection) through our existing Citrix XenApp farm.
Also,  conventional RSA and Smart Card solutions were becoming costlier  and cumbersome.
After evaluating various OTP - based solutions,  we  found Azure Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) as the most  viable one.
IT-run book automation  :  The growing demands of business and the  ever-increasing number of applications resulted in rapid growth of  the back-end infrastructure.
Significant effort was needed to manage  security patches and passwords for over 2,000 service accounts and to  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 60 | Annexures to the Board’s report monitor applications.
For effective management of these processes, the  IT team set out on a ‘one-click’ mission.
We designed comprehensive  workflows that automate end-to-end human process.
Traditionally ,  provisioning infra was also manual and each VM typically required up  to two days.
With the deployment of VMware vRealize Automation, VM  provisioning has become automated, thereby reducing provisioning  time to less than 30 minutes and admin effort by 90%.
Efficient power management  :  The entire infrastructure was earlier kept  online 24x7 to ensure service availability but most of it was found to  be underutilized during non-business hours.
To reduce the cost of  power, we have built and deployed an automated power management  tool which will continuously monitor the workload on each Virtual  Machine (VM) and shut down based on threshold.
This has yielded  power savings of around 25% per VM.
Integrated weblog analytics  :  Our requirement was to analyze millions  of lines of weblogs across our web server farms to supply application  owners with usage analytics and trends based on hits, browser analysis,  proactive error correction, and potential attacks and exception hit  trends.
There were prohibitively costly tools like WebTrends available  in this space but were still not meeting all our requirements.
We developed Weblog Analytics solution enabling Near Real Time  that now overcomes the historical limitations of weeks required for  on - demand processing weblogs, limitations of data retention online,  deep dive and drill through analytics and reporting for large data  volumes.
Weblogs are now parsed every five minutes on the web  servers, processed and made available on the dashboard within  15 minutes.
Today , 52 core web servers generate 3+ TB weblog text files  (2 GB / server), 200+ million hits and 2+ billion records per month.
We have been able to retain 2.5 years of historical data online in PDW  that has 28 billion+ records, sizing about 3.4 TB (highly compressed)  which on SMP SQL server would have been nearly 136 TB.
IT infrastructure Energy-efficient IT infrastructure We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our IT infrastructure  more energy-efficient.
Some of the measures implemented are  : Desktop power management  :  Terminator, our end-point power  management tool, shuts down computers after a specified idle period.
Paperless office drive  :  Several measures were taken, including secure  PIN-based printing, awareness campaigns, mailers and linking paper  consumption data to the user’s carbon footprint record.
Desktop application virtualization  :  Leveraging bubble computing or  soft-grid computing, our Computers and Communication Division  built a solution that ensured better operational efficiencies, platform  independence and productivity improvement.
Virtualization and consolidation  :  We have further expanded our  internal private cloud capacity with MyCloud, which now has a  capacity of around 11,000 virtual machines.
We have continued to  expand our network-attached storage (NAS)-based virtualization  this year.
Data centers and server rooms  :  We have standardized and incorporated  eco-friendly designs for data center and server rooms to ensure  reduction in power consumption.
We have created two state-of-the - art  data centers at Pune and Bangalore that run on high efficiency (around  1.2-1.3 PUE) using latest technologies like rack-level cooling.
We have  redesigned two of our existing data centers at Pune and Hyderabad  from legacy architecture to an energy-efficient design by adopting hot  and cold aisles and caging for rows of racks.
Unified communications solution The deployment of Lync communication has made it possible to make  calls (including video calls) directly from the system, share files /  applications, thus cutting down travel requirements of our employees  and thereby reducing CO2 emissions.
We have doubled and enhanced  our video conferencing (VC) capacity , resulting in a 70% increase in  our VC usage.
Research and development expenditure The R&D centers of the Company , located at Bangalore,  Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Mysore and  Thiruvananthapuram, have been accorded approval for weighted  deduction by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research  (DSIR) effective November 23, 2011, which has been renewed  effective April 2014.
The Company has claimed weighted tax  deduction on eligible research and development till July 31, 2015  based on approval from DSIR.
With effect from August 1, 2015, the  business of Finacle, including the R&D activities, is transferred to its  wholly - owned subsidiary , EdgeVerve Systems Limited.
Hence, from  that date, EdgeVerve Systems Limited has claimed the weighted tax  deduction on eligible research and development expenditures u/s  35(2AB) of the Income-tax Act 1961.
The weighted tax deduction is  equal to 200% of such expenditure incurred.
The eligible R&D revenue and capital expenditure on a standalone  basis are ` 54 cr ore and Nil respectively for the year ended March 31,  2016 and ` 160 cr ore and Nil respectively for the year ended 31, 2015.

Industry structur e and developments Software and computing technology are transforming businesses in  every industry around the world in a very profound and fundamental  way .
The continued reduction in the unit cost of hardware, the  explosion of network bandwidth, advanced software technologies  and technology-enabled services are fuelling the rapid digitization  of business processes and information.
Traditional business models  are being disrupted in every industry with digital and software-based  business models.
This disruption is characterized by highly desirable  user experiences, an extreme scale-of-cost performance that has  become available in computing infrastructure and disintermediation  of the supply chain.
Leveraging technologies and models of the digital  era to both extend the value of existing investments and, in parallel,  transform and future-proof their businesses is increasingly becoming  a top priority for business leaders.
This duality – to renew existing  core businesses and innovate new businesses – is the essence of what  companies are faced with as strategic imperatives today .
From an IT perspective, the renewal translates to harnessing the  efficiency of distributed cloud computing, enabling legacy systems  for mobile and sensor access, extracting value out of digitized data,  keeping systems relevant and optimizing the costs of building and  running technology systems.
And as businesses look to new areas and  new economics, new and intelligent systems are required to be built  with next-generation technologies and with exponentially superior  cost-benefit performance.
The rapid pace at which technology is changing and the need for  highly-skilled professionals in both the renewed and new technology  areas are driving businesses to rely on third parties to realize their  IT transformation.
Several technology solution and service providers  have emerged over the years, offering different models for clients to  consume their solution and service offerings  : •  T echnology consulting companies – who take on niche and time  bound projects for their clients •  Global IT outsour cing companies – who leverage global talent pools  to systematically optimize the IT operations of clients •  Business pr ocess outsourcing firms – who leverage global talent  pools to manage the outsourced core business processes of  their clients •  Softwar e firms – who provide licensed software that enable the  automation of business processes •  Specialty platform and Softwar e-As-A-Service companies – who  provide utility-based models for clients to consume software features •  Data analytics companies – who specialize in designing, analyzing  and r eporting insights from the vast amount of data that corporations  are collecting about their customers, operations and markets •  Inter nal IT departments of the companies themselves – usually cost  centers for the corporations There is an increasing need for highly-skilled technology professionals  in the markets in which we operate and in the industries to which  we provide services.
At the same time, companies are reluctant to  expand their internal IT departments and increase costs.
These factors  have increased the reliance of companies on their outsourcing service  providers and are expected to continue to drive future growth for  outsourcing services.
We believe that because the effective use of  offshore technology services offers lower total costs of ownership  of IT infrastructure, lower labor costs, improved quality and  innovation and faster delivery of technology solutions, companies are  increasingly turning to offshore technology service providers.
The key  factors contributing to the growth of IT and IT-enabled services in  India include high-quality delivery , significant cost benefits and the  availability of a large and growing skilled and English-speaking IT  professionals.
Our proven Global Delivery Model, our comprehensive  end-to-end solutions, our commitment to superior quality and process  execution, our long-standing client relationships, and our ability to  scale and to service clients across industries make us one of the leading  offshore service providers in India.
Global Delivery Model Our Global Delivery Model is based on a scalable infrastructure that  results in multiple efficiencies for our clients.
We divide projects into  components that we execute simultaneously at client sites and at our  Development Centers in India and around the world.
We optimize  our cost structure by maintaining the flexibility to execute project  components where it is most cost effective.
We are then able to execute  project components round the clock and across time zones, to reduce  project delivery times.

The increase  in software development expenses from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to increase in cost of efforts (comprising employee  cost and cost of technical sub-contractors).
The cost of efforts has  increased as a percentage of revenue from 53.5% in fiscal 2015 to  54.4% in fiscal 2016.
The increase in cost of efforts is due to an  increased engagement of technical sub-contractors to meet certain  skill requirements in complex projects which has been partially offset  by a decrease in employee cost as a percentage of revenue.
Employee  costs relate to salaries paid to employees in India and overseas and  include staff welfare expenses.
The increase in salaries and bonus  is primarily due to increased compensation in the last 12 months,  promotions and an increase in the number of employees, partially  offset by the role - mix changes and currency impact.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the years  ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 is 34.61% and 33.99%,  respectively .
Export profits for the year were entitled to tax benefits  under the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) scheme of the Government of  India.
The Company had also claimed tax benefit under the Software  Technology Park (STP) scheme, for export profits earned by certain  STP units up to the year ended March 31, 2011.
We have our operations both under the STP and SEZ schemes.
The profits attributable to operations under the STP scheme were  exempted from income tax for a consecutive period of 10 years from  the financial year in which the unit started producing computer  software, or March 31, 2011, whichever was earlier.
However, the  income tax incentives provided by the Government of India for STP  units have expired, and the income from all of our STP units are now  taxable.
SEZ units, which began providing services on or after April 1,  2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived  from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year  in which the unit has commenced the provision of services and 50%  of such profits or gains for the five years thereafter subject to creation  of a Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve out of the profit of  the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company  for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business  as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
On a standalone basis, the effective tax rate (based on profit before  exceptional item and tax) decreased to 27.8% in fiscal 2016,  as compared to 28.3% in fiscal 2015.
The decrease in the effective  tax rate was mainly due to decrease in overseas taxes, increase in tax  reversals partially offset by decrease in benefits from SEZ units as a  percentage of profit before income taxes, increase in Indian statutory  corporate tax rate and reduction in deductions on eligible research  and development expense based on the approval received from the  Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) for Finacle®.
On a consolidated basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 27.9% in  fiscal 2016, as compared to 28.4% in fiscal 2015, which was mainly  due to a decrease in overseas taxes, increase in tax reversals partially  offset by a decrease in benefits from SEZ units as a percentage of profit  before income taxes and increase in Indian statutory corporate tax rate.
The reversal of the provision is primarily due to completion of audits  in certain jurisdictions.

VI  Inter nal control systems and their  adequacy The CEO and CFO certification provided in the CEO and CFO  Certification section of the Annual Report discusses the adequacy of  our internal control systems and procedures.
VII  Material developments in human  r esources / industrial relations,  including number of people employed Our culture and reputation as a leader in consulting, technology ,  outsourcing and next-generation services enable us to attract and  retain some of the best talent in India.
Human capital Our professionals are our most important assets.
We believe that the  quality and level of service that our professionals deliver are among the  highest in the global technology services industry .
We are committed  to remaining among the industry’s leading employers.
As at March 31, 2016, the Group employed 1,94,044 employees,  of which 1,82,329 were software professionals, including trainees.
During fiscal 2016, we added 17,857 new hires, net of attrition.
Our  culture and reputation as a leader in the technology services industry  enables us to recruit and retain some of the best available talent in  India.
The key elements that define our culture include recruitment,  training and development, and compensation.
Recruitment We have built our global talent pool by recruiting new students from  premier universities, colleges and institutes in India, and through the  need-based hiring of project leaders and middle managers.
We recruit  students who have consistently shown high levels of achievement from  campuses in India.
We, generally , also recruit students from campuses  in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and China.
We rely on a rigorous  selection process involving aptitude tests and interviews to identify  the best applicants.
This selection process is continually assessed and  refined based on the performance tracking of past recruits.
During fiscal 2016, we received 11,15,745 employment applications,  interviewed 1,21,670 applicants and extended offers of employment  to 55,056 applicants.
These statistics do not include our subsidiaries.
Training and development The competency development of our employees continues to be a  key area of strategic focus for us.
We launched new programs for  our employees in keeping with the changes in the use of technology  in education.
We enhanced our technology - led training efforts in  multiple areas.
As part of our Foundation Program, an integrated  learning platform has been developed that combines teaching,  hands - on learning and assessments of in-class training to provide  students an enhanced learning experience.
Our continuous education programs emphasize enhancing the  relevance and effectiveness of learning.
For instance, hands-on  assessments have been strengthened and skill-based certifications  have been included.
We have also made significant investments in hardware and software  assets to boost our infrastructure capabilities.

Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 74 | Corporate governance report Corporate governance report Our corporate governance philosophy Good corporate governance is about maximizing shareholder value on a sustainable basis while ensuring fairness to all stakeholders  : customers,   vendor- partners, investors, employees, government and society.
– N. R. Narayana Murthy We are committed to defining, following and practising the highest level of corporate governance across all our business functions.
Our corporate  governance is a reflection of our value system encompassing our culture, policies, and relationships with our stakeholders.
Integrity and  transparency are key to our corporate governance practices and performance and ensure that we retain and gain the trust of our stakeholders  at all times.
Corporate governance framework The driving principles of our corporate governance framework are encapsulated in the following diagram : Our value system – C-LIFE C-LIFE  connotes Client value, Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness and Excellence.
This is the foundation for our policies and company culture.
Corporate structure Have a simple and transparent  corporate structure driven  solely by business needs Transparency Ensure transparency  and maintain a  high level of disclosure Stakeholder relationship Communicate, externally  and truthfully, about how  the Company is run internally Management as a trustee Management is the trustee  of the shareholders’ capital  and not the owner In spirit and letter Satisfy both the spirit of the law and the letter of the law Corporate Governance Framework This framework ensures effective engagement with our stakeholders  and helps us to be guided by our core values, and at the same time  allows us to do more and be more for our stakeholders.
Our corporate  governance framework ensures that we make timely disclosures and  share accurate information regarding our financials and performance,  as well as disclosures related to the leadership and governance of  Infosys (‘the Company’).
We believe that an active, well-informed and  independent board is necessary to ensure the highest standards of  corporate governance.
At Infosys, the Board of Directors (‘the Board’)  is at the core of our corporate governance practice.
The Board thus  oversees the Management’s functions and protects the long - term  interests of our stakeholders.
As on March  31, 2016, the Board  consists of nine members of which seven are independent directors.
An independent director is nominated as the chairperson of each of  the Board committees, namely audit, nomination and remuneration,  stakeholder relationship, risk and strategy , finance and investment and  corporate social responsibility committees.
Compliance with global guidelines and standards We comply with a broad selection of key governance principles  and regulations.
For example, the Cadbury Report in the U.K. in  1992 was a significant event in modern corporate governance.
The report recommended the arrangement of company boards and  accounting systems to reduce corporate governance risks and failures.
The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, resulted in the senior  management individually certifying the accuracy of their company’s  financial information.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act sought to build a safer, more stable financial  system to set the foundation for sound economic growth and job safety .
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has notified SEBI  (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015  (LODR) on September 2, 2015, replacing the earlier listing agreement  (w.e.f.
December 1, 2015) and is aimed to consolidate and streamline  the provisions of earlier listing agreements for different segments  of the capital market viz.
equity , debentures, debt instruments, etc.
The LODR regulations have incorporated the principles for corporate  governance in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) principles and provide broad principles  for periodic disclosures by listed entities in line with the International  Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles.
As part of our commitment to follow global best practices,  we  substantially comply with the Euroshareholders Corporate  Governance Guidelines 2000 and the recommendations of the  Conference Board Commission on Public Trusts and Private  Enterprises in the U.S. We also adhere to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) and the OECD principles.
Corporate governance guidelines Over the years, the Board has developed corporate governance  guidelines to help fulfill our corporate responsibility towards our  stakeholders.
These guidelines ensure that the Board will have  the necessary authority and processes to review and evaluate our  operations when required.
Further, these guidelines allow the Board  to make decisions that are independent of the Management.
The Board  may change these guidelines regularly to achieve our stated objectives.
A.  Boar d composition Size and composition of the Board We believe that our Board needs to have an appropriate mix of executive  and independent directors to maintain its independence, and separate  its functions of governance and management.
Listing regulations  mandate that for a company with a non-executive chairman, at least  one-third of the board should be independent directors.
On March 31,  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Corporate governance report | 75  Chairman of the Board K. V .
Kamath stepped down as Chairman and Independent Director of  the Company effective June 5, 2015 consequent to his appointment  as the President of the New Development Bank promoted by BRICS  nations.
R. Seshasayee, an independent director, took over as the  Chairman of the Board effective June 5, 2015.
Responsibilities of the Chairman, the Chief  Executive Officer and Managing Director The Company has appointed a non-executive chairman of the Board  (‘the Chairman’) – R. Seshasayee and a chief executive officer and  managing director (the CEO and MD) – Dr. Vishal Sikka.
The responsibilities and authority of these officials are as follows  : The Chairman is the leader of the Boar d. As Chairman, he is responsible  for fostering and promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a  culture where the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit  of the Company and all its stakeholders.
The Chairman is primarily  responsible for ensuring that the Board provides effective governance  to the Company .
In doing so, the Chairman presides over meetings of  the Board and of the shareholders of the Company .
The Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and facilitating  effective communication among directors.
He is responsible for matters  pertaining to governance, including the organization, composition and  effectiveness of the Board and its committees, and the performance of  individual directors in fulfilling their responsibilities.
The Chairman  provides independent leadership to the Board, identifies guidelines  for the conduct and performance of directors, and oversees the  management of the Board’s administrative activities such as meetings,  schedules, agendas, communication and documentation.
The Chairman actively works with the nomination and remuneration  committee to plan the Board and Board committees’ composition,  induct directors to the Board, plan for director succession, participate  in the Board effectiveness evaluation process and meet with individual  directors to provide constructive feedback and advice.

The average tenure of executive directors  (whole-time directors) is two years and that of independent directors is 3.6 years.
In February 2016, the Board, after evaluating, proposed the  re-appointment of Prof. Jeffrey S. Lehman because his continued service was deemed necessary considering the Company’s transition to new  leadership.
The Board felt that Prof. Lehman’s tenure complements the tenures of the other Board members, and as a director who has seen the  Company under the management of promoters and non-promoters, he bridges the gap between the past and current perspectives.
The average tenure of Board members as on March 31, 2016 was as follows  : R. Seshasayee ................................ (5.2 years, since January 13, 2011) Prof. Jeffrey S. Lehman .................

The Board exercises its duties with care, skill and diligence  and exercises independent judgment.
The Board sets strategic goals  and seeks accountability for their fulfillment.
The Board also directs  and exercises appropriate control to ensure that the  Company is  managed in a manner that fulfills stakeholders’ aspirations and  societal expectations.
Definition of independent directors The Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and  Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 defines an ‘independent  director’ as a person who is not a promoter or employee or one of the  key managerial personnel of the Company or its subsidiaries.
The laws  also state that the person should not have a material pecuniary  relationship or transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries,  apart from receiving remuneration as an independent director.
We abide by these definitions of independent director in addition to  the definitions of an independent director as laid down in the New  York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and U.S. securities laws by virtue  of our listing on the NYSE in the U.S. Board membership criteria The nomination and remuneration committee works with the  entire Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and  experience required for the Board as a whole and for individual  members.
Members are expected to possess the required qualifications,  integrity , expertise and experience for the position.
They should also  possess deep expertise and insights in sectors / areas relevant to the  Company , and ability to contribute to the Company’s growth.
The age limit for a managing director / executive director is 60 years  while the age limit for an independent director is 70 years.
A director’s  term may be extended at the discretion of the committee beyond  the age of 60 or 70 years with shareholder approval by passing a  special resolution based on the explanatory statement annexed to the  Notice for such motion indicating the justification for extension of  appointment beyond 60 or 70 years as the case may be.
The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for, attend  and participate in all Board and applicable committee meetings.
Each member is expected to ensure that their other current and  planned future commitments do not materially interfere with their  responsibilities with us.
Selection of new directors The Board is responsible for the selection of new directors.
The Board  delegates the screening and selection process to the nomination and  remuneration committee, which consists exclusively of independent  directors.
The nomination and remuneration committee makes  recommendations to the Board on the induction of new directors.
Training of Board members All new non-executive directors inducted to the Board are introduced  to our Company culture through orientation sessions.
Current  executive directors and senior management provide an overview  of our operations, and familiarize the new non-executive directors  with them.
They are also introduced to our organization structure,  our services, group structure and subsidiaries, constitution, Board  procedures, matters reserved for the Board, and our major risks and  risk management strategy .
The Board’s policy is to have separate meetings regularly with  independent directors to update them on all business-related issues  and new initiatives.
At such meetings, the executive directors and  other members of the senior management share points of view and  leadership thoughts on relevant issues.
We also facilitate the continual educational requirements of our  directors.
Each director is entitled to a training fee of US  $5,000 per  year.
Support is provided for independent directors if they choose to attend  educational programs in the areas of Board / corporate governance.
Independent directors of the Board are familiarized through three  kinds of engagements  :   Deep dives and immersion sessions Deep dives and immersion sessions are conducted by senior executives  on their respective business units.
The business unit can be an industry  vertical or a service offering unit.
Key aspects that are covered in these  sessions include   : •  Industr y / market and technology trends •  Competition  •  The Company’ s performance •  Strategic bets and their pr ogress •  Futur e outlook Strategy retreat A strategy retreat is conducted for all the Board members every year  and includes participation by senior business executives.
This session  helps Board members familiarize themselves with the strategy and  business of the Company .
STRAP Our annual strategy and planning event, STRAP , is usually a two-day  event.
Along with the Board members, almost all senior executives  from business and support functions are invited to this event.
At STRAP , a detailed view of the strategy is presented by all business  and support units.
The objective of STRAP is to communicate the  strategy and make the organization aware about it.
These are the three specific mechanisms through which Board  members are familiarized with the Company culture and operations.
Apart from these, there could be additional meetings or sessions on  demand on specific topics.
All directors attend the familiarization  programs as these are scheduled to coincide with the Board meeting  calendar to give them an opportunity to attend.

Membership term The Board constantly evaluates the contribution of the members  and periodically shares updates with the shareholders about  re - appointments consistent with applicable statutes.
The current law  in India mandates the retirement of two-third of the non-independent  directors (who are liable to retire by rotation) every year, and qualifies  the retiring members for re-appointment.
Executive directors are  appointed by the shareholders for a maximum period of five years,  but are eligible for re-appointment upon completion of their term.
An independent director shall hold office for a term of up to five  consecutive years on the Board of the Company and will be eligible for  re-appointment on the passing of a special resolution by the Company .
Board member evaluation One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review  the  Board evaluation framework.
The Board works with the  nomination and remuneration committee to lay down the evaluation  criteria for the performance of executive / non-executive / independent  directors through a peer evaluation, excluding the director being  evaluated through a Board effectiveness survey .
The questionnaire of  the survey is a key part of the process of reviewing the functioning  and effectiveness of the Board and for identifying possible paths  for improvement.
Each Board member is requested to evaluate the  effectiveness of the Board dynamics and relationships, information  flow, decision - making of the directors, relationship with stakeholders,  Company performance and strategy , and the effectiveness of the  whole Board and its various committees.
Feedback on each director  is encouraged to be provided as part of the survey .
The evaluation for  fiscal 2016 has been completed.
Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and  guidance.
Some of the performance indicators based on which the  independent directors are evaluated include  : •  The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate   governance practices Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 78 | Corporate governance report Service contracts, notice period, severance fees We have entered into agreements with our executive directors,  Dr. Vishal Sikka, the CEO and MD, and U.
B. Pravin Rao, our COO.
Dr. Vishal Sikka’s executive employment agreement was replaced  with a new executive employment agreement, through postal ballot  approved by the shareholders on March 31, 2016.
This agreement  was effective April 1, 2016 and expires on March 31, 2021.
The Board  and its nomination and remuneration committee have approved the  following compensation   : •  B ase pay :  An annual base salary of US  $ 1,000,000 to be paid in  accordance with the Company’s normal practices and subject to  withholding taxes; •  V ariable pay  :  Annual performance-based variable pay at a target  level of US  $3,000,000 less applicable tax and subject to the   Company’s achievement of fiscal year performance targets set by  the Board as described in the postal ballot; •  Stock compensation  : Eligible to r eceive an annual grant  of 1)  US  $2,000,000  of fair value in RSUs which vest over  time (‘time - based RSUs’), subject to continued service, and  2) US  $5,000,000 in performance-based equity and stock options  up on achievement of certain performance targets as described in  the postal ballot; •  Employee  benefits and paid vacation as applicable to other  whole - time directors of the Company; •  Min imum and maximum remuneration  : Shou ld Dr. Sikka fail  to achieve minimum performance targets, his remuneration  as proposed will fall to US  $3,000,000  annually , consisting of  US  $1,0 00,000 of base salary and US  $2,0 00,000 of time - based  RSUs.
If Dr.  Sikka’s performance targets are exceeded, the  performance-based payments for variable components of his  compensation (variable pay and performance equity) will be capped  at 150% of the target compensation for such variable components.
We have agreed with Dr. Sikka to provide each other with 90 days’  notice of termination as applicable.
Dr.  Sikka may be entitled to  severance benefits depending on the circumstances of his termination  of employment.
During fiscal 2015, we entered into a restricted stock unit award  agreement with Dr.  Vishal Sikka, our CEO and MD.
Pursuant to  the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, Dr. Sikka was granted  27,067 restricted stock units (the equivalent of 1,08,268 RSUs after  adjustment for the bonus issues).
The RSUs vest over a period of  four years subject to Dr. Sikka’s continued employment and upon  achieving certain performance indicators set by the Board or the  nomination and remuneration committee from time to time.
The Board in its meeting held on June 22, 2015, on recommendation  of the nomination and remuneration committee, further granted  1,24,061 RSUs to Dr. Vishal Sikka.
These RSUs are vesting over a  period of four years from the date of the grant in the proportions  specified in the award agreement.
The RSUs will vest subject to the  achievement of certain key performance indicators as set forth in the  award agreement for each applicable year of the vesting tranche and  continued employment through each vesting date.
The award granted to Dr. Vishal Sikka on June 22, 2015 was modified  by the nomination and remuneration committee on April 14, 2016.
There is no modification or change in the total number of RSUs granted  or the vesting period (which is four years).
The modifications relate to  the criteria of vesting for each of the years.
Based on the modification,  the first tranche of the RSUs will vest subject to achievement of certain  key performance indicators for the year ended March  31, 2016.
Subsequent vesting of RSUs for each of the remaining years would be  subject to continued employment.
None of our directors except Dr.  Vishal Sikka is eligible for any  severance pay .
Pravin Rao’s employment agreement provides for a monthly salary ,  bonuses, and benefits including vacation, medical reimbursements  and gratuity contributions.
The agreement with him has a five-year  term and either party may terminate the agreement with six months’  notice or as mutually agreed between the parties.
There are no benefits  payable upon termination of this agreement.
We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our directors  and officers for claims brought under U.S. laws to the fullest extent  permitted by Indian law.
These agreements, among other things,  indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses, judgments,  fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any  action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of Infosys  Limited, arising out of such persons’ services as our director or officer.
Non-executive / independent directors’ remuneration Shareholders at the 34th Annual General Meeting held on June 22,  2015 approved a sum not exceeding 1% per annum of the net profits  of the Company calculated in accordance with the provisions of  Section 198 of the Act, to be paid and distributed among some or all  of the directors of the Company (other than the managing director and  whole-time directors) in a manner decided by the Board of Directors  and this payment will be made with respect to the profits of the  Company for each year.
We have paid ` 8.39 cr ore to our Independent Directors for the year  ended March 31, 2016.
The aggregate amount was arrived at using the following criteria  : Particulars in ` crore in US $ Fixed Board fee 0.50 75,000 Board attendance fee (1) 0.17 25,000 Non-executive chairman fee 0.99 150,000 Chairperson – audit committee 0.20 30,000 Members – audit committee 0.13 20,000 Chairperson – other committees 0.13 20,000 Members – other committees 0.07 10,000 Travel fee (per meeting) (2) 0.07 10,000 Incidental fees (per meeting) (3) 0.01 1,000 Notes : 1 US  $ = ` 66.26 as on Mar ch 31, 2016  (1) T he Company normally has five regular Board meetings in a year .
Independent  directors are expected to attend the four quarterly Board meetings and the Annual  General Meeting (AGM).
(2) For dir ectors based overseas, the travel fee shown is per Board meeting.
This is based  on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated for  independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.
(3) For dir ectors based overseas, incidental fees shown is per Board meeting.
The incidental  fees are paid to non-executive directors for expenses incurred during their travel to  attend Board meetings in India.
The Board believes that the above compensation structure is  commensurate with global best practices in terms of remunerating  non-executive / independent directors of a company of similar size,  and adequately compensates for the time and contribution made by  our non-executive / independent directors.
Memberships in other boards An executive director may , with the prior consent of the chairman  of the Board, serve on the board of two other business entities,  provided that such business entities are not in direct competition  with our operations.
Executive directors are also allowed to serve on  the boards of corporate or government bodies whose interests are  germane to the future of the IT and software business or the key  economic institutions of the nation, or whose prime objective is to  benefit society .
Independent directors are not expected to serve on the  boards of competing companies.
There are no other limitations except  those imposed by law and good corporate governance practices.

The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the audit committee.
The primary objective of the audit committee is to monitor and  provide an effective supervision of the Management’s financial  reporting process, to ensure accurate and timely disclosures, with  the highest levels of transparency , integrity and quality of financial  reporting.
The audit committee oversees the work carried out in the  financial reporting process by the Management, the internal auditors  and the independent auditors, and notes the processes and safeguards  employed by each of them.
The audit committee has the ultimate  authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, where appropriate,  replace the independent auditors in accordance with the law.
All  Audit committee report for the year ended March 31, 2016 Each member of the committee is an independent director, according  to the definition laid down in the audit committee charter, Section 149  of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 18 of the SEBI (Listing  Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and  NYSE requirements.
The Management is responsible for the Company’s internal control  over financial reporting and the financial reporting process.
The  independent auditors are responsible for performing an  independent audit of the Company’s financial statements in  accordance with the Generally Accepted Auditing Principles, and for  issuing a report thereon.
The committee’s responsibility is to monitor  these processes.
The committee is also responsible for overseeing the  processes related to financial reporting and information dissemination.
This is to ensure that the financial statements are true, fair, sufficient  and credible.
In addition, the committee recommends to the Board  the remuneration, appointment and terms of appointment of the  Company’s internal and independent auditors.
In this context, the committee discussed the overall scope and plans for  the independent audit with the Company’s auditors.
The Management  shared the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance  with the Indian GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards  (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  with the committee.
The committee discussed with the auditors,  in the absence of the Management (whenever necessary), regarding  the Company’s audited financial statements, including the auditors’  judgment about the quality , not just the applicability , of the accounting  principles, the reasonableness of significant judgment and the clarity  of disclosures in the financial statements.
The committee also discussed other matters required by the Statement  on Auditing Standards No.
114, as amended (AICPA, Professional  Standards, Volume 1.
AU Section 380) – the auditors’ communication  with those charged with governance, and by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  2002, with the auditors.
Relying on the review and discussions conducted with the Management  and the independent auditors, the committee believes that the  Company’s financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with  Indian GAAP and IFRS.
The committee has also reviewed the internal control over financial  reporting put in place to ensure that the accounts of the Company  are properly maintained and that the accounting transactions are in  accordance with prevailing laws and regulations.
In conducting such  reviews, the committee found no material discrepancy or weakness in  the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The committee also reviewed the financial policies of the Company  and expressed its satisfaction with the same.
The Company’s auditors provided written disclosures and a letter for  applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board to the committee.
This is regarding the auditors’ communication  with the committee concerning independence, based on which the  committee discussed the auditors’ independence with both the  Management and the auditors.
After the review, the committee  expressed its satisfaction on the independence of both the internal  and the independent auditors.
The committee also considered whether  any non-audit services provided by the independent audit firm could  impair such auditors’ independence, and concluded that there were  no such services provided.
The committee has confirmed compliance of the Board to the  NYSE and Euronext London and Euronext Paris exchange rules on  composition of the committee and independence of the committee  members, disclosures relating to non-independent members, financial  literacy and financial expertise of members, and a review of the audit  committee charter.

Business objectives The business objectives of the Company are articulated as a set of  specific near-term goals, and long-term strategic goals in a corporate  scorecard.
These goals cover the dimensions of consistent financial  performance, market penetration, differentiation in solutions,  services and operational excellence, leveraging talent and long-term  sustainability of the organization.
3.
Risk categories Our risk management framework considers the following broad  categories of risks  : Strategy Risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy  and the risks to the successful execution of these strategies are covered  in this category – for example, risks inherent to our industry and  competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices  of target markets, the Company’s market offerings, business models  and talent base.
Details of the Company’s strategy are described in  other sections of this document.
Potential risks to the long-term  scalability and sustainability of the organization are also analyzed and  mitigated – for example, societal risks relating to the impact of our  strategy on the environment, local communities, and conservation of  essential resources.
We periodically assess risks to the successful execution of our strategy ,  such as the effectiveness of strategic programs that are being executed,  the momentum in new initiatives, the impact of strategy on financial  performance, leveraging of inorganic strategies, effectiveness of  organization structure and processes, retention and development of  high-performing talent and leadership.
External Risks arising out of uncontrollable factors from outside the  organization are covered in this category – for example, risks of  adverse developments in the regulatory environment in which we  operate, unfavorable trends in the macroeconomic environment  including currency fluctuations, natural disasters and attacks on our  physical and technology infrastructure.
Operational controls Risks arising out of inefficiencies in the design, operations or systems  of internal controls are covered in this category – for example, risks  of non-compliance to policies, information security , data privacy ,  intellectual property , individuals engaging in unlawful or fraudulent  activity or breaches of contractual obligations.
These risks could  typically result in penalties, financial loss, litigation and loss of  reputation and are assessed primarily on dimensions such as business  process effectiveness, segregation of duties, compliance with policies  and procedures, and strength of underlying controls.
These risks also  include counterparty risks arising from our association with entities  for conducting business, namely clients, vendors, alliance partners and  their respective industries.
4.
Risk management pr ocesses The Company’s risk management practices are : Risk identification, analysis, and evaluation Mechanisms for identification of risks include annual risk surveys  across the Company , industry benchmarking, periodic assessments  of the business environment, incident analysis, findings of internal  audits, discussions with the risk council and the risk and strategy  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 92 | Risk management report committee and analysis of the Company’s performance relative to  the corporate scorecard goals.
Risk analysis and evaluation is carried  out using scenario-based assessments to decide the potential impact,  likelihood of occurrence and in some cases, the detectability of the  risk.
Estimated risks are compared with established risk criteria and  thresholds to determine the priority and method of risk treatment.
Risk treatment Risk treatment is the process of selecting and implementing measures  to alleviate the impact of identified risks.
•  A void   : A decision to nullify the risk by refraining from the activities  that cause it •  T ransfer   : A decision to transfer the specific risk to another entity •  Reduce   : A decision to reduce the level of risk through targeted  mitigation, if not to completely nullify it •  Accept   : A decision to allow the risk to remain as is, irrespective of  its severity Risk mitigation and monitoring Mitigation plans are finalized, owners are identified and the progress of  mitigation actions are monitored and reviewed.
The risk and strategy  committee periodically does a deep dive into understanding the  scope and effectiveness of mitigation plans and provides feedback to  mitigation teams.
Risk-based approach to strategic planning At Infosys, the functions of strategic planning and risk management  are intertwined.
Risks to achieving business objectives are key  inputs to the formulation and development of strategy and business  planning.
Key strategic initiatives are identified to mitigate specific  risks.
This approach is practiced at various levels of the Company ,  such as in client account teams, project teams, support departments  and subsidiaries.
Risk reporting and disclosures Dashboards help track external and internal indicators for each  identified risk and assess its severity .
The trend line assessment of  top risks, analysis of exposure and potential impact are carried out  periodically , presented and discussed with the risk council and risk  and strategy committee.
Key external and internal incidents are  reported and reviewed at appropriate fora, such as the Information  Security Council and meetings of the executive board.
Risks relating to  client project execution and client account level risks are reported and  discussed at appropriate levels within the Company .
Periodic updates  are provided to the Board highlighting key risks, their impact and  mitigation actions.
Key risk factors are disclosed in regulatory filings.

LLP Chartered Accountants Firm’s registration number : 101248W/W -100022 Bangalore 15 April, 2016 Supreet Sachdev Partner Membership number : 205385 Annexure B to the Auditors’ Report  Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies  Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Infosys Limited (‘the Company’) as of 31 March 2016 in conjunction  with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial  reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly  and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection  of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as  required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted  our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) and the  Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable  to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting were established and maintained and  if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 98 | Standalone financial statements Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of  the Management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial  reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal  financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting  criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

1.
Significant accounting policies 1.1  Basis of pr eparation of financial statements These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with Rule 7 of the Companies  (Accounts) Rules, 2014, the provisions of the Act (to the extent  notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board  of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been consistently applied  except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted  or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in  the accounting policy hitherto in use.
1.2  Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of income and expenses during the period.
Examples of such estimates include computation of percentage of  completion which requires the Company to estimate the efforts or  costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs  to be expended, provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations  under employee retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post-sales  customer support and the useful lives of fixed tangible assets and  intangible assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in  estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in  circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates are  reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes  are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  financial statements.
1.3  Revenue r ecognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are either  on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the  related services are performed and revenue from the end of the  last billing to the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled  revenues.
Revenue from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts,  where there is no uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of  consideration, is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion  method.
When there is uncertainty about measurement or ultimate  collectability , revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty  is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as  unbilled revenue while billings in excess of cost and earnings are  classified as unearned revenue.
Deferred contract costs are amortized  over the term of the contract.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on  uncompleted contracts is recorded in the period in which such losses  become probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed-price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based upon  the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising out of the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives  to customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Company recognizes  the liability based on its estimate of the customer’s future purchases.
If it is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met,  or if the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then discount is  not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can be  estimated reliably .
The Company recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts in the period in which change  occurs.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as direct  payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from  the Company and is determined as the difference between the sale  price and carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized  ratably on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized  using the time-proportion method, based on rates implicit in the  transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company’s right  to receive dividend is established.
1.4  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company  has a present legal obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Standalone financial statements | 103  1.5  Post-sales client support and warranties The Company provides its clients with a fixed period post-sales  support for corrections of errors and support on all its fixed-price,  fixed-t imeframe contracts.
Costs associated with such support  services are accrued at the time when related revenues are recorded  and included in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company  estimates such costs based on historical experience and the estimates  are reviewed annually for any material changes in assumptions and  likelihood of occurrence.
1.6  Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower  than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under  the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost  of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling  the contract.
1.7  T angible assets and capital work-in-progress Tangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until such assets are  ready for use.
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
1.8  Intangible assets Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and impairment.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits  are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete  and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably .
The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of materials, direct  labor, and overhead cost that are directly attributable to preparing the  asset for intended use.
1.9  Depr eciation and amortization Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the straight-line  method over the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during a period is  proportionately charged.
Intangible assets are amortized over their  respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis,  commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for  its use.
The Management estimates the useful lives for the other fixed  assets as follows  : Buildings (1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles (1) 5 years (1) Based on te chnical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above  best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets.
Hence,  the useful lives for these assets are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C  of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end  (Refer to Note 2.8).
1.10   Impair ment The Management periodically assesses, using external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the  higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use, which means the  present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing  use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment loss for an  asset is reversed if, and only if, the reversal can be related objectively  to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.
The carrying amount of an asset is increased to its revised recoverable  amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated  amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized  for the asset in prior years.
1.11   Retir ement benefits to employees Gratuity The Company provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan  (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible employees.

1.13   For eign currency transactions Foreign-currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are  translated at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date.
The gains  or losses resulting from such translations are included in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value  was determined.
Non-monetary assets and non - monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost  are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the date  of the transaction.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement  of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit  for the period in which the transaction is settled.
1.14    Forwar d and options contracts in foreign  currencies The Company uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The use  of these foreign exchange forward and options contracts reduces the  risk or cost to the Company and the Company does not use those for  trading or speculation purposes.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Company adopted AS 30, ‘Financial  Instruments  : Recognition and Measur ement’, to the extent that the  adoption did not conflict with existing accounting standards and  other authoritative pronouncements of the Company Law and other  regulatory requirements.
Forward and options contracts are fair valued at each reporting  date.
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward  and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of  foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast transactions.
The Company records the gain or loss on effective hedges, if any , in the  hedging reserve until the transactions are complete.
On completion,  the gain or loss is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss of  that period.
To designate a forward or options contract as an effective  hedge, the Management objectively evaluates and evidences with  appropriate supporting documents at the inception of each contract  and subsequently whether the contract is effective in achieving  offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the  fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedges and derivative  instruments that do not qualify or have not been designated for hedge  accounting are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
1.15   Income taxes Income taxes are accrued in the same period that the related revenue  and expenses arise.
A provision is made for income tax, based on  the tax liability computed, after considering tax allowances and  exemptions.
Provisions are recorded when it is estimated that a liability  due to disallowances or other matters is probable.
Minimum Alternate  Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise  to future economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future  income tax liability , is recognized as an asset in the Balance Sheet if  there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal tax  after the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured  reliably .
The Company offsets, on a year-on-year basis, the current tax  assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right and where  it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified,  and thereafter, a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets in situation where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exist, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income  will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in situation of unabsorbed depreciation  and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if there is  reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax assets are  reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying values at  each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities have  been offset wherever the Company has a legally enforceable right to  set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and where the  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes  levied by the same taxation authority .
The income tax provision for  the interim period is made based on the best estimate of the annual  average tax rate expected to be applicable for the full financial year.
Tax  benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share  options in excess of compensation charged to Statement of Profit and  Loss are credited to the securities premium reserve.
1.16   Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after  tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing  the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares  been actually issued at fair value which is the average market value of  the outstanding shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later  date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are  adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits  and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the  approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
1.17   Investments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance  the Company’s business interests.
Investments are either classified as  current or long - term based on the Management’s intention.
Current  investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of each  investment individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises  the Indian rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long - term investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to  recognize any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of  each investment.

The Company considers all highly  liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase  of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known  amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.
1.20   Leases Lease under which the Company assumes substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight-line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss  over the lease term.

The activity in the 2011 Plan during the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 is as follows  : Particulars Year ended March 31, 2016 Year ended March 31, 2015 Shares arising  out of options Weighted  average  exercise price  (`) Shares arising  out of options Weighted  average  exercise price  (`) 2011 Plan   : Outstanding at the beginning 1,08,268 5  –  –  Granted (1) 1,24,061 5 1,08,268 5 Forfeited and expired  –  –  –  –  Exercised (1) 10,824 5  –  –  Outstanding at the end 2,21,505 5 1,08,268  5  Exercisable at the end  –  –  –  –  (1) Adjusted for bonus issues Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Standalone financial statements | 107  The weighted average share price of options exercised under the 2011  Plan on the date of exercise was ` 1,088.
The weighted average r emaining contractual life of RSUs outstanding  as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 under the 2011 Plan was  1.98 years and 2.39 years.
The differential on stock compensation expense if the ‘fair value’ of the  RSUs on the date of the grant were considered instead of the ‘intrinsic  value’ is less than ` 1 crore for each of the years ended March 31, 2016  and March 31, 2015.
Consequently , there is no impact on earnings  per share.
The fair value for the above impact analysis is estimated on the date  of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following  assumptions   : Particulars Options granted during fiscal 2016 2015 Grant date 22-Jun-15 21-Aug-14 Weighted average share price (`) (1) 1,024 3,549 Exercise price (`) (1) 5 5 Expected volatility (%) 28-36 30-37 Expected life of the option (years) 1-4 1-4 Expected dividends (%) 2.43 1.84 Risk-free interest rate (%) 7-8 8-9 Weighted average fair value as on  grant date (`) (1) 948 3,355 (1) Data for fiscal 2015 is not adjusted for bonus issues The expected term of an RSU is estimated based on the vesting term  and contractual term of the RSU, as well as expected exercise behavior  of the employee who receives the RSU.
Expected volatility during  the expected term of the RSU is based on historical volatility of the  observed market prices of the Company’s publicly traded equity shares  during a period equivalent to the expected term of the RSU.

These demands were paid to statutory tax authorities, including ` 913 cr ore paid  during the year ended March 31, 2016, consequent to demand from tax authorities in India  for fiscal 2011 towards denial of certain tax benefits.
The Company has filed an appeal  with the income tax appellate authorities.
Demand for fiscals 2007, 2008 and 2009 includes disallowance of a portion of the   deduction claimed by the Company under Section 10A of the Income-tax Act as determined  by the ratio of export turnover to total turnover .
The disallowance arose from certain  expenses incurred in foreign currency being reduced from export turnover but not reduced  from total turnover .
Demand for fiscals 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 also includes  disallowance of the portion of profit earned outside India from the STP units under Section  10A of the Income-tax Act and disallowance of profits earned from SEZ units under Section  10AA of the Income-tax Act.
The matters for fiscals 2007, 2008 and 2009 are pending  before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) Bangalore.
The matter for fiscals 2010  and 2011 is pending before the Income Tax Appellate T ribunal (ITAT) Bangalore.
The  Company is contesting the demand and the Management including its tax advisors  believes that its position will likely be upheld in the appellate process.

2.28   Segment reporting The  Company’s operations predominantly relate to providing  end - to - end business solutions to enable clients enhance their business  performance.
During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company  reorganized its segments to enhance executive-customer relationships,  improve focus of sales investments and increase management  oversight.
However, the reorganizations did not have any impact on  the reportable segments as per AS 17 ‘Segment reporting’ apart from  Manufacturing being named Manufacturing and Hi-tech.
The segment  information has been presented both along industry classes and  geographic segmentation of customers, industry being the primary  segment.
The accounting principles used in the preparation of the  financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and  expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the significant  accounting policies.
Industry segments for the Company are primarily enterprises in  : •  Financial Ser vices and Insurance (FSI) •  Manufacturing and Hi-tech (MFG & HI-TECH)  •  Ener gy & utilities, Communications and Services (ECS) •  Retail, Consumer packaged goods and Logistics (RCL)  •  Life Sciences and Healthcar e (LSH)  Geographic segmentation is based on business sourced from specific  geographic regions and delivered from both onsite and offshore  locations.
North America comprises the United States of America,  Canada and Mexico; Europe includes continental Europe (both the  east and the west), Ireland and the United Kingdom; and the Rest of  the World comprises all other places except those mentioned above  and India.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company’s offshore software  development centers and onsite expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses,  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not allocable to specific segments as the underlying  assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes that it is  not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and  expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as  ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of the Company .
Fixed assets used in the Company’s business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.
Accordingly , no disclosure relating to total segment assets and liabilities  are made.
Geographical information on revenue and industry revenue  information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in  relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

LLP Chartered Accountants Firm’s registration number : 101248W/W -100022 Bangalore 15 April, 2016 Supreet Sachdev Partner Membership number : 205385 Annexure to the Auditors' Report Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies  Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 31 March 2016, we have  audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Infosys Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiary companies which  are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are  responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established  by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted  our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) issued  by ICAI and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively  in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial  reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Consolidated financial statements | 127  Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management  and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,  or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper  management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any  evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over  financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects,  an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating  effectively as at 31 March 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

1.
Significant accounting policies 1.1  Basis of pr eparation of financial statements These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read with Rule 7 of the Companies  (Accounts) Rules, 2014, the provisions of the Act (to the extent  notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board  of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been consistently applied  except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted  or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in  the accounting policy hitherto in use.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the  principles and procedures required for the preparation and  presentation of consolidated financial statements as laid down under  the Accounting Standard (AS) 21, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements  of the Company , its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries as disclosed  in Note 2.21 , combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together  book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses  after eliminating intra-group balances and transactions and resulting  unrealized gain / loss.
The consolidated financial statements are  prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group.
Minority interests have been excluded.
Minority interests represent  that part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that  are not, directly or indirectly , owned or controlled by the Company .
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence  but not control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the  equity method of accounting as laid down under Accounting Standard  (AS) 23, ‘Accounting for Investment in Associate in Consolidated  Financial Statements’.
The investment is initially recognized at cost,  and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the  investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition  date.
The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified  on acquisition.
1.2  Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the  period.
Examples of such estimates include computation of percentage  of completion which requires the Group to estimate the efforts or  costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to  be expended, provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations under  employee retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post-sales customer  support and the useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in  estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes  in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in  which the changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1.3  Revenue r ecognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are either  on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts is recognized as the related  services are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing  to the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled revenues.
Revenue from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, where  there is no uncertainty about measurement or collectability of  consideration, is recognized based on the percentage-of-completion  method.
When there is uncertainty about measurement or ultimate  collectability , revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty  is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as  unbilled revenue, while billings in excess of cost and earnings are  classified as unearned revenue.
Deferred contract costs are amortized  over the term of the contract.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on  uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses  become probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed-price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based on  the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Group accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives to  customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Group recognizes the  liability based on its estimate of the customer’s future purchases.
If it  is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or if  the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then the discount  is not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can  be estimated reliably .
The Group recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts in the period in which the  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 132 | Consolidated financial statements change occurs.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as  direct payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from the  Group and is determined as the difference between the sale price and  carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized ratably  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized using  the time-proportion method, based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Group’s right to receive  dividend is established.
1.4  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group  has a present legal obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
1.5  Post-sales client support and warranties The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period, post-sales  support for corrections of errors and support on all its fixed-price,  fixed - timeframe contracts.
Costs associated with such support services  are accrued at the time when related revenues are recorded and  included in consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group  estimates such costs based on historical experience and the estimates  are reviewed annually for any material changes in assumptions and  likelihood of occurrence.
1.6  Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the  unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost of terminating  the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract.
1.7  T angible assets and capital work-in-progress Tangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until such assets are  ready for use.
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
1.8  Intangible assets including goodwill Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and impairment.
Goodwill comprises the excess of purchase  consideration over the parent’s portion of equity of the subsidiary  at the date on which investment in the subsidiary is made.
Goodwill  arising on consolidation or acquisition is not amortized but is tested  for impairment.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are  probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use  or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably .
The costs  which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor and  overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for  its intended use.
1.9  Depr eciation and amortization Depreciation on tangible assets is provided on the straight-line  method over the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation for assets purchased / sold during a period is  proportionately charged.
Intangible assets are amortized over their  respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis,  commencing from the date the asset is available to the Group for use.
Leasehold improvements are written off over the lower of the remaining  primary period of lease or the life of the asset.
The Management  estimates the useful lives for the other fixed assets as follows  : Buildings (1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles (1) 5 years (1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above  best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets.
Hence,  the useful lives for these assets are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part  C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end.
(Refer to Note 2.7) 1.10   Impair ment The Management periodically assesses, using external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is  higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use, which means the  present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing  use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment loss for  an asset other than goodwill is reversed if, and only if, the reversal  can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment  loss was recognized.
The carrying amount of an asset other than  goodwill is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided this  amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined (net of any accumulated amortization or depreciation)  had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
1.11   Retir ement benefits to employees Gratuity The Group provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan  (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible employees of Infosys and its  Indian subsidiaries.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment  to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination  of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s  salary and the tenure of employment with the Group.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial  valuation, performed by an independent actuary , at each Balance Sheet  date using the projected unit credit method.
The Company fully  contributes all ascertained liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees’  Gratuity Fund Trust (‘the Trust’).
In case of Infosys BPO and EdgeVerve,  contributions are made to the Infosys BPO’s Employees’ Gratuity Fund  Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees’ Gratuity Fund Trust,  respectively .

Minimum alternate  tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise to  future economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future income  tax liability , is recognized as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet  if there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal tax after  the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured reliably .
The Group offsets, on a year-on-year basis, the current tax assets and  liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right and where it intends  to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified, and  thereafter a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets, in situation where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exist, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be  realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in situations of unabsorbed  Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 134 | Consolidated financial statements depreciation and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if  there is reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax  assets are reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying  values at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities have been offset wherever the Group has a legally enforceable  right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to  income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .
Tax benefits of  deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of  compensation charged to consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  are credited to the securities premium account.
1.16   Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after  tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing  the profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares  been actually issued at fair value, which is the average market value  of the outstanding shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later  date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted  retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus  share issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the  consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors.
1.17   Investments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance the Group’s  business interests.
Investments are either classified as current  or long - term, based on the Management’s intention.
Current  investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of each  investment individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises  the Indian Rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long-term investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to  recognize any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of  each investment.
1.18   Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash-on-deposit with  banks and financial institutions.
The Group considers all highly  liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase  of three months or less and that are readily convertible to known  amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.
1.19   Cash Flow Statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit  before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated.
1.20   Leases The leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight-line basis in the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss over the lease term.
1.21   Gover nment grants The Group recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable  assurance that the conditions attached to them shall be complied  with, and the grants will be received.
Government grants related to  depreciable assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized  in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and  rational basis over the useful life of the asset.
Government grants related  to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them  with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

2011 RSU Plan The Company had a 2011 RSU Plan (‘the 2011 Plan’) which provided  for the grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) to eligible employees of  the Company .
The Board of Directors recommended the establishment  of the 2011 Plan to the shareholders on August 30, 2011 and the  shareholders approved the recommendation of the Board of Directors  on October 17, 2011 through a postal ballot.
The maximum aggregate  number of shares that may be awarded under the plan was 1,13,34,400  and the plan was expected to continue in effect for a term of 10 years  from the date of initial grant under the plan.
During the year ended  March 31, 2015, the Company made a grant of 1,08,268 restricted  stock units (adjusted for bonus issues) to Dr. Vishal Sikka, Chief  Executive Office and Managing Director.
The Board, in its meeting  held on June  22,  2015, on the recommendation of nomination  and remuneration committee, further granted 1,24,061 RSUs to  Dr. Vishal Sikka.
These RSUs are vesting over a period of four years  from the date of the grant in the proportions specified in the award  agreement.
The RSUs will vest subject to achievement of certain key  performance indicators as set forth in the award agreement for each  applicable year of the vesting tranche and continued employment  through each vesting date.
Further, the Company has earmarked  1,00,000 equity shares for welfare activities of the employees,  approved by the shareholders through a postal ballot which ended  on March 31, 2016.
The equity shares currently held under this plan,  i.e.
1,12,23,576 equity shares (this includes the aggregate number of  equity shares that may be awarded under the 2011 Plan as reduced  by 10,824 equity shares already exercised by Dr. Vishal Sikka and  1,00,000 equity shares which have been earmarked for welfare  activities of the employees) have been subsumed under the 2015 Plan.
Further, the award granted to Dr. Vishal Sikka on June 22, 2015 was  modified by the nomination and remuneration committee on April 14,  2016.
There is no modification or change in the total number of RSUs  granted or the vesting period (which is four years).
The modifications  relate to the criteria of vesting for each of the years.
Based on the  modification, the first tranche of the RSUs will vest subject to  achievement of certain key performance indicators for the year ended  March 31, 2016.
Subsequent vesting of RSUs for each of the remaining  years would be subject to continued employment.
In accordance with the SEBI Regulations, 2014, the excess of the  closing market price on the grant date of the RSUs over the exercise  price is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 136 | Consolidated financial statements The activity in the 2011 Plan during the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 is as follows : Particulars Year ended March 31, 2016 Year ended March 31, 2015 Shares arising  out of options Weighted  average  exercise price Shares arising  out of options Weighted  average  exercise price The 2011 Plan Outstanding at the beginning (1)  1,08,268  5  –  –  Granted  1,24,061  5  1,08,268  5  Forfeited and expired  –  –  –  –  Exercised (1)  10,824  5  –  –  Outstanding at the end  2,21,505  5  1,08,268  5  Exercisable at the end  –  –  –  –  (1) Adjusted for bonus issues The weighted average remaining contractual life of RSUs outstanding  as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 under the 2011 Plan was  1.98 years and 2.39 years, respectively .
The weighted average share price of options exercised under the 2011  Plan on the date of exercise was ` 1,088.
T he differential on stock compensation expense if the ‘fair value’ of the  RSUs on the date of the grant were considered instead of the ‘intrinsic  value’ during the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015  is less than ` 1 crore.
Consequently , there is no impact on earnings  per share.
The fair value for the above impact analysis is estimated on the date  of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the following  assumptions   : Particulars For options granted in fiscal 2016 2015 Grant date 22-Jun-15 21-Aug-14 Weighted average share price  (`) (1) 1,024 3,549 Exercise price (`) (1) 5 5 Expected volatility (%) 28-36 30-37 Expected life of the option (years) 1-4 1-4 Expected dividends (%) 2.43 1.84 Risk-free interest rate (%) 7-8 8-9 Weighted average fair value as on  grant date (`) (1) 948 3,355 (1) Data for fiscal 2015 is not adjusted for bonus issues The expected term of an RSU is estimated based on the vesting term  and contractual term of the RSU, as well as expected exercise behavior  of the employee who receives the RSU.
Expected volatility during  the expected term of the RSU is based on historical volatility of the  observed market prices of the Company’s publicly traded equity shares  during a period equivalent to the expected term of the RSU.
During the years ended March  31, 2016 and March  31, 2015,  the  Company recorded an employee compensation expense of  ` 7  crore and ` 2  crore in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.23   Segment reporting The Group’s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end  business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance.
During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Group reorganized its  segments to enhance executive customer relationships, improve focus  of sales investments and increase management oversight.
However, the  reorganizations did not have any impact in the reportable segments  as per AS 17 ‘Segment reporting’ apart from Manufacturing being  named as Manufacturing and Hi-tech.
Segment information has been  presented both along industry classes and geographic segmentation  of customers, industry being the primary segment.
The accounting  principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are  consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual  segments, and are as set out in the significant accounting policies.
Industry segments for the Company are primarily enterprises in  :  •  Financial Ser vices and Insurance (FSI) •  Manufacturing and Hi-tech (MFG & HI-TECH)  •  Ener gy & utilities, Communications and Services (ECS) •  Retail, Consumer packaged goods and Logistics (RCL)  •  Life Sciences and Healthcar e (LSH)  Geographic segmentation is based on business sourced from a specific  geographic region and delivered from both onsite and offshore  locations.
North America comprises the United States of America,  Canada and Mexico; Europe includes continental Europe (both the  east and the west), Ireland and the United Kingdom; and the Rest of  the World comprises all other places except those mentioned above  and India.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company’s offshore software  development centers and onsite expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the  underlying assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes  that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those  costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately  disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of  the Company .
The fixed assets used in the Company’s business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.
Accordingly , no disclosure relating to total segment assets and liabilities  are made.
Geographical information on revenue and industry revenue  information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in  relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

While ensuring maximum profitability and benefit for our shareholders,  clients and employees, and working towards the well-being of the  larger community around us, we also aim to ‘do more with less’  when it comes to using finite natural resources.
By going beyond the  demand of mandates and regulations, by focusing on innovation and  continuous learning to be relevant at all times to all stakeholders,  we aim to make responsible business one of the most important  dimensions of ‘being Infosys’.
Our Business Responsibility Report  (BRR), which we have been publishing as part of our Annual Report  since 2012, is one of the channels we use to articulate our commitment  and provide details of our activities during the financial year.
The BRR follows the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social,  Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business, as notified  by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India.
We also publish a comprehensive Sustainability Report annually,  independently assured by DNV GL, in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiative’s G4 framework.
The  sustainability report is  available at https://www.infosys.com/sustainability.
LEED Platinum certified building, Mahindra City campus, Chennai Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 160 | Business Responsibility Report RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS The vision of Infosys (‘the Company’) to be a  globally-respected corporation continues to be the  cornerstone of our governance.
This principle also  guides our continuous efforts to earn the respect of  all our stakeholders.
It is, therefore, our responsibility  to respect and adhere to ethical practices in all  aspects of our business.
The Infosys Code of Conduct  and Ethics Policy helps maintain the standards of  business conduct across the Group and applies to  employees, suppliers, vendors, agents, contractors,  representatives, consultants or any other third-party  agent working on behalf of the Company.
Our values articulate the behavior expected from all  employees, contractors and suppliers and are the  foundation for all processes and practices.
•  Client value  : T o surpass client expectations  consistently •  Leadership by example  : T o set high standards  in our business and transactions, and be an  exemplar for the industry •  Integrity and transpar ency  : T o be ethical, sincere  and open in all our transactions •  Fairness  : T o be objective and transaction - oriented,  and thereby earn trust and respect •  Excellence  : T o strive relentlessly and constantly  improve ourselves, our teams, services and  products, and become the best Ethical conduct  : Structur es and practices  In line with our core value of ‘integrity and  transparency’, we ensure we satisfy the spirit and the  letter of the law.
The key dimensions of our corporate  governance framework are as follows  : Board governance The Infosys Board of Directors (‘the Board’) has  developed a robust corporate governance framework  to ensure we conduct our business responsibly.
The nomination and remuneration committee of the  Board is responsible for appointments to the Board.
For this, the committee follows a set of criteria based  on the belief that an active, diverse, well - informed and  independent Board will ensure the highest standards  of corporate governance.
In line with our principles  of corporate governance, the Board oversees how  the Management serves and protects the long - term  interests of our stakeholders.
As on March 31, 2016,  the majority of our Board members — seven out of  nine — are independent members.
We follow the  practice of nominating an independent director  as the chairperson of our committees, namely, the  audit, corporate social responsibility, nomination  and remuneration, risk and strategy, stakeholders  relationship and finance and investment committees.
For more details, refer to the Corporate governance  section of the Annual Report.
Corporate policies Our corporate governance practices apply across  the Infosys Group and extend to our suppliers  and partners too.
Our code of conduct and ethics  complies with the legal requirements of applicable  laws and regulations, including anti - bribery and  anti - corruption, the ethical handling of conflicts of  interest, and the fair, accurate and timely disclosure  of reports and documents that are filed with the  required regulatory bodies.
Every employee  attends a session on Company values during his  or her induction, and agrees to follow our code  of conduct and ethics.
Additional policies, such  as the Whistleblower Policy and Gift Policy, and  the presence of a strong grievance redressal body  help us maintain an uncompromising stand on  value transgressions.
Enterprise risk management (ERM) Our ERM framework encompasses practices relating  to the identification, assessment, monitoring and  mitigation of strategic, operational, and external  environment risks to achieve our key business  objectives.
This is done through periodic review  meetings of the risk management committee and  the risk council.
For more details, refer to the Risk management  section of the Annual Report.
Focus on sustainability Our sustainability strategy includes economic,  environmental and social imperatives, while paying  attention to the needs and expectations of our  internal and external stakeholders.
Our leaders have  been championing sustainability initiatives through  global forums and bodies.
Regular discussions and  reviews with the Board and its committees, senior  management and other stakeholders help us work  consistently towards fulfilling the expectations of our  direct and indirect stakeholders.

Including the visually-challenged Of the 285 million visually -challenged people in the  world, nearly 90% is fr om the developing world.
For  the visually - challenged, Braille helps drive literacy,  which in turn ensures intellectual freedom, personal  security, employment, and financial independence.

Drushti is a high-performance, reliable, low - cost,  low - maintenance electronic notes maker specially  designed to address the problems of traditional  Braille devices.
Drushti can be used for reading,  writing and storing data.
It enables users to  navigate, manage, edit and print data using an  audio feedback mechanism.
Drushti can interface  with external devices like computers, keyboards,  printers, speakers, headphones and flash drives and  has the potential to revolutionize the inclusion and  integration of the visually - challenged into society.

Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 170 | Business Responsibility Report RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS Infosys is a signatory to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC) and we adhere to the fundamental  principles of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights (UNHRC).
Our Human Rights statement  guides our policies and practices dealing with  our operations, partnerships, contracts and  investment agreements.
Human rights laws and guidelines are respected  and followed across our operations.
While mutual  agreements assure stakeholders such as, vendors  and suppliers, of protection against human rights  violations, all our employees are introduced to  these polices during induction.
Periodic evaluation  is conducted to reduce risk of violations at all levels.
Human rights  : Best practices Infosys created a Human Rights Statement as part of  the UNGC pact.
This statement guides the policies  and practices related to our operations, partnerships,  investment agreements and contracts.
It also explains  the Company’s stand on compliance with global  norms in providing a harassment - free workplace,  freedom of association, workplace health and safety,  and anti - corruption safeguards.
A stringent internal  and independent review through work councils and  a comprehensive governance framework ensures  that we are compliant with current and ongoing best  practices related to human capital.
We have about  14,000 contractual staff, of which close to 12,000  are from the local community.

Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Business Responsibility Report | 171  BEING MORE ENVIRONMENT CONSCIOUS Sustainability is a business imperative at Infosys.
Our environmental goals are part of our corporate  scorecard.
This has resulted in significant  investments in technology and research partnerships  to create new solutions that are sustainable for  the environment.
Conservation of resources Energy With highly efficient building designs, smart building  automation and deep green retrofits, we are on our  way to achieving our goal of reducing 50% of our per  capita electricity use by 2018 against the baseline  established in 2008.
Our central command center  in Bangalore now manages about 45 million sq.
ft.  of built-up area across our campuses in India.
The  Mysore campus has a second command center to  manage operations across Infosys on a regular basis.
We continue to share our data driven best practices  to mainstream energy-efficient technologies and  initiatives along with shaping a low-carbon path for  the benefit of the larger community.
One of our greatest achievements this year has  been the addition of solar capacity at our 450-acre  Hyderabad SEZ campus making the campus 100%  powered by solar energy.
We have installed a 6.6  MW solar photovoltaic plant capable of generating  12  million units annually on this campus, which  currently seats about 15,000 employees This plant  was set up in  a 50 acre space  within the campus.
As part of our commitment to source 100% of our  electricity from renewables, in fiscal 2016 we have  installed solar power plants of 9.7 MW capacity  across our campuses.
This takes our total installed  capacity to about 12 MW of solar power plants across  our campuses in India.
This fiscal, we were awarded the – LEED (Leadership  in Energy and Environmental Design) India  Platinum rating for two of our buildings in Pune and  Bangalore, and GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated  Habitat Assessment) 5-star rating for two of our  buildings in Hyderabad.
With this, we now have 14  LEED Platinum-rated buildings and four buildings  with GRIHA 5-star rating covering an area of about  5.25 million sq.
ft. that has the highest level of green  certification.
We have implemented one of the world’s largest  energy-efficiency retrofit programs in our buildings  across different locations in India.
This initiative continues and has expanded, leading  to drastic reductions in energy use.
The deep-green  retrofits in air conditioning and UPS systems have  helped us achieve a 16 MW and 12 MW reduction  respectively in connected load in the last five years  The Infosys Command Center in Bangalore manages about 45 million sq. ft.
of area across our campuses Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 172 | Business Responsibility Report and for fiscal 2016, air conditioning retrofits alone  have led to a 2.5 MW reduction in the connected load.
Most of the retrofits implemented have a payback of  less than three years and can be easily replicated  in large scale, making sound commercial as well as  environmental sense.
Through this, we have set a  great example to other large businesses in India and  worldwide.
Emissions We strive to reduce our carbon emissions through  specific initiatives and taking this further, we have  made a voluntary commitment to become carbon  neutral.
To offset our scope 1 and  3 emissions,  we  made a conscious choice to source our offsets  from community projects that create real and  lasting socio - economic benefits.
By supporting  such projects throughout its lifecycle, we are not  only catalyzing these projects, but also creating  socio - economic value.
This fiscal, we started three  carbon offset projects including a household biogas  project and two high-efficiency biomass cook stove  projects.
Together, they will generate approximately  30% of our carbon offset requirement in 2017 - 18.
Water All of our new buildings are designed with the  most optimal standard of fresh water requirement  – 16 liters per capita per day, which is nearly 65%  lower compared to the requirement of the National  Building Code.
This has been achieved with our strategy to reduce  consumption with water efficient technologies and  equipment, recycle 100% of the waste water and  reuse treated waste water for flushing, landscaping  and cooling purposes within the campus.. We have  worked towards measures to sequester rainwater to  the maximum possible levels and today, we have 149  recharge wells and 25 lakes that enable recharging  groundwater across our campuses.
We ensure that  the efficiency is maintained by continuous monitoring  of water consumption through smart water metering.
Our massive smart water metering program enables  us to monitor all our water consumption online  from a central location and has helped us plan  water efficiency programs..
These initiatives have  resulted in significant reduction in the per capita  fresh water consumption across our campuses.
It has  also fetched benefits like reduced dependence on  municipal supply of water, minimized operational  business risks and at the same time enhanced water  access to others.
Waste Our initiatives are spread across three dimensions –  influencing social behavior, process optimization and  the implementation of technology.
We have installed  biogas plants to convert food waste into biogas,  organic waste converters to convert food and garden  waste into rich manure and a vermi - composting  system for paper waste, among other initiatives.
This year, we installed biogas plants of 5.5 tons per  day capacity in different campuses to convert food  waste into biogas that was then used in the kitchen  of our food courts.
This has a potential to save about  300 kilograms of cooking gas (LPG) per day.
Biodiversity We believe that a rich biodiversity plays a vital  role in the creation of a healthy and sustainable  environment.
We make every effort to conserve and  promote biodiversity at all our owned facilities and  encourage our employees and stakeholders to do  the same.
We have planted over 80,000 saplings  this year alone, taking the total number of saplings  planted in our campuses in the last eight years to  over 5,00,000, resulting in a rich diversity of flora and  fauna.
Being a responsible corporate citizen  Protection of the environment ranks high among  our corporate goals and as a responsible corporate  citizen, we are committed to have a specific policy in  place to ensure we take definite steps to protect the  environment.
Our Health, Safety and Environment  (HSE) policy – that regularly shares best practices  and provides a safe and healthy workplace for our  employees, contractors and visitors – is testimony  to this effort.
The policy is made available to all our  employees worldwide on Sparsh (our intranet), and  as posters and instructions on digital and physical  display areas across our campuses.
We have received  ISO  14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001 certification for  77% of our locations in India.
Our  objectives and  targets have been documented at the corporate and  development center levels and is monitored and  tracked at regular intervals.
We also have operational  controls for impact management based on severity.
We did not have any monetary or non-monetary  sanctions imposed on us for non-compliance with  environmental laws and regulations during fiscal 2016.

When Chennai experienced unprecedented rainfall  in December 2015 causing severe floods, volunteers  from our Chennai development center supported  over 60 villages by sending relief materials to the  affected areas and attended to the needs of people,  who had lost their homes.
Joining hands with the  Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), we provided  high-capacity pumps to the state government to  drain out flood water.
Community sabbatical Our employees are encouraged to take a break  from work to participate in and lead community  development projects through the Sabbatical policy  for community service launched in October  2008.
During this time, they receive half their salary and  are given the choice to return to normal work, after  completion of the project, within six months to  one year.
Till date, 56 employees have availed of the  community sabbatical option.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 Business Responsibility Report | 177  ADDING VALUE TO CLIENTS Infosys enables clients in more than 50 countries  to stay ahead of emerging business trends and  outperform their competition.
Our experience  gives our clients a distinct advantage.
In addition to  transforming their business, we efficiently manage  their operations.
We deliver business value in global  scalability, process efficiency and cost optimization  for our clients Our solutions and services rely more on intellectual  assets than on physical ones.
All our marketing  communications including advertising, promotions  and sponsorships comply with the relevant laws of the  country that we operate in.
In addition, our guidelines  clearly state our brand strategy, architecture and  every aspect of our distinct brand philosophy.
We have stringent processes and practices to ensure  that data privacy is maintained.
The global nature  of our operations may require that personal data,  originating from a region with stringent data privacy  laws, may be processed in another part of the world  with an emerging privacy regulatory regime.
It is,  therefore, imperative that, regardless of the location  of data processing, adequate measures around  personal data processing are deployed to not  only strengthen our compliance to applicable data  protection laws, but also to create stakeholder trust  and confidence.
A dedicated data privacy group and a  cross - functional Information Security Council,  headed by the COO, U. B.
Pravin Rao, ensure data  privacy compliance in our client engagements and  the highest level of sponsorship for it.
As we cater to  client organizations from diverse industries such as,  banking, retail, telecom and healthcare, the scope  of privacy and data protection for personal data of  individual consumers is often limited to contractual  requirements agreed upon with our clients, and  subsequently deployed during project execution.
Our clients translate applicable data protection laws  into contractual requirements, wherever appropriate  and Infosys implements necessary and sufficient  measures to comply with these requirements.
In  fiscal  2016, three incidents relating to breach of  customer data privacy were reported.
All incidents  have been addressed and closed.
Client engagement We interact with our clients on a regular basis and  across multiple platforms.
We also host premier  CXO - level events annually in Europe and the  Americas, which are specifically designed for our  BPO clients and for the banking clients of Finacle.
The forums that have been set up to engage  and strengthen our partnerships with clients are  as follows   : •  Client satisfaction surveys •  Engagement level feedback •  Client visits and meetings •  Quarterly business r eviews •  Sustainability portal on our website,  www.infosys.com •  Conclaves and workshops •  Analyst meets W e have a robust approach to receive feedback from  clients and understand their expectations.
We also  gather ‘feedforward’ that allows us to understand the  client’s expectations and needs and helps us make  the right investment decisions.
Our annual Client Value Survey (CVS) and  Engagement level feedback help us take  corrective actions, gain insights and understand  our clients better.
The CVS framework includes a  structured questionnaire with a satisfaction rating  on a seven - point scale, encompassing close to  30 parameters, with language versions in English,  French, German, Japanese and Spanish.
Feedback is collected through a web survey hosted  by an independent organization ensuring the  confidentiality of the information shared.
The survey model focuses on  : •  Expectation and fulfillment – the top thr ee  expectations of CXOs and senior-level  respondents and their perception on fulfillment •  Client disposition – Gauging the overall  experience of working with us •  Business and technology priorities along  with expectations •  Service line feedback •  Comparison with best-of-br eed firms –  client - selected benchmarks  •  Clustering clients into homogeneous gr oups to  ensure a differential approach Feedback from the survey informs various change  initiatives in the organization.
Infosys Annual Report 2015-16 178 | Business Responsibility Report The data gathered is analyzed statistically to classify  clients into core, moderate and breakaway groups.
The account teams are then facilitated to review  their relationships with individual clients and to  design interventions that create a positive and visible  impact on our clients.
Various members across levels  engage with clients to seek their feedback and  inputs on service delivery, product expectations and  technology requirements.
Overall, the client experience has remained at  similar levels as last year.
There has been a notable  improvement in experience among the CXOs when  compared to the previous year.
Engagement level feedback (ELF) ELF is a periodic survey, and is done multiple times  during the course of a project.
It covers 14 different  parameters and includes areas such as, service  delivery management, the quality of products or  services delivered, and behavioral competencies of  team members involved in the engagement.
Our delivery and quality teams collaborate to  study and evaluate a set of parameters during an  engagement with an aim to improve the quality of  deliverables and obtain client satisfaction.
ELF  is  also treated as the lead indicator in our annual CVS.
Based  on the account-level ELF , the client partner  and the delivery anchor drive improvement programs  for the account.
