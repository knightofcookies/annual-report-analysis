Annual Report 2013-14 Evolving with changing times  Narayana Murthy  Executive Chairman of the Board Think big and act boldly Very few people get an opportunity to add value to a great  company a second time, that too after retirement.
I am grateful to  K. V .
Kamath, V .
Balakrishnan, T. V .
Mohandas Pai, Ravi Venkatesan,  and to my family for the role they played in my coming back to the  company .
While the results of what we have set out to do are still  far from being realized, this journey has been very exciting and  invigorating for me.
In the process, I have got to know better many  extraordinary Infoscions in sales, software delivery , and business  enabler functions.
My office, the CFO and the head of Human  Resources have played a seminal role in this journey .
I record my  gratitude to these fine people, Kris  Gopalakrishnan, Shibulal,  members of the Board, and to every Infoscion for their support,  commitment, hard work, smart ideas and passion to enhance the  Infosys magic.
One thing is certain from my interactions.
That is,  if Infoscions decide, they can succeed in reaching for the stars.
We have done creditably this year by doubling our revenue growth  to 11.5% (in US dollar terms).
Further, our operating margin  improved from 23.5% in Q1 FY 2014 to 25.5% in Q4 FY 2014.
This is laudable by any standard.
I congratulate every Infoscion on  this stellar performance.
The task ahead is simple to state.
It is to increase the competitiveness  of Infosys in the market to achieve industry‑leading growth and  margins.
This goal requires us to attract, enable, empower and  retain the best and the brightest talent and build a multi‑cultural  workforce; develop leadership and succession planning; improve  the agility of the company; and sharpen the accountability of our  business units, business enabler functions, projects and individuals  to deliver results.
These initiatives will improve our sales effectiveness, augment  our delivery effectiveness, optimize our costs, and reduce risks  arising out of visa regulations and other external factors.
As part  of these initiatives, we have been focusing on strengthening our  brand, becoming more meritocratic and multi‑cultural, expanding  our market coverage, enlarging our value proposition, quickening  our responses to our stakeholders, sharpening our focus on  recruitment and training, improving our productivity , and cutting  down wasteful expenditure.
These activities are work in progress  and will take about two years to yield results.
I have travelled to our markets and our campuses, spoken to a large  number of Infoscions, answered their questions, addressed their  concerns, encouraged their enthusiasm, and lent support to their  enormous zeal to achieve aspirational goals.
The  enthusiasm,  commitment, energy and hard work of every Infoscion to achieve  our goals are evident.
I salute every one of them.
At the same time,  let us remember the famous saying, “Growth is painful.
Change is  painful.
But, nothing is as painful as staying stuck where you do  not belong.” I request every Infoscion to think big and act boldly .
Evolving with changing times Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 S. Gopalakrishnan  Executive Vice Chairman of the Board Evolving growth story Every business evolves as it grows, adds customers, introduces  new products, enters new markets, and forays into new business  segments.
And once in a while, the business context changes  significantly , making it imperative for the business to transform  itself and adapt to the change.
We faced such a change in 2011.
Mobile devices and computers  were becoming the primary devices for users to interact with  applications and information systems.
Social media was creating  new models of collaboration between consumers, businesses and  organizations.
Businesses needed to be present on social media and  analyze the content to make intelligent business decisions.
Cloud  computing brought access to unlimited computing and storage on  a pay‑for‑use model to the market.
All these changes presented  new business opportunities for IT services providers like Infosys.
Hence, we set up separate units to pursue these opportunities.
For, if we did not pursue these avenues, we stood to lose business  in the medium to long term.
It is difficult to time technology disruptions perfectly .
You either  run the risk of being too early or too late.
To balance our portfolio  of businesses, we announced the Infosys 3.0 strategy , where a third  of our revenues would accrue from new technologies over time.
Another one‑third would come from Business IT Services (BITS)  comprising Application Outsourcing, Infrastructure Management,  Independent Validation, and Business Services Management, and  the rest would come from Consulting and Systems Integration  services.
We underestimated the effects of the adoption of these new  technologies and the change in the business model.
These newer  services created smaller projects since many of the engagements  were pilots.
They also changed the revenue profile since clients  preferred a subscription model to buy Cloud services.
Our traditional BITS business slowed down, perhaps due to a lack  of focus.
While our revenues grew , in US dollar terms by 25.8% in  fiscal 2011, it dipped to 15.8% in fiscal 2012 and further to 5.8%  in fiscal 2013.
As revenue growth declined, margins also declined.
We now needed to focus on superior growth and margins again.
The Board brought back Narayana Murthy as the Executive  Chairman in June 2013, given that there were leadership changes  also in the offing.
He introduced three initiatives — to optimize  costs, to improve sales effectiveness, and to improve delivery  effectiveness.
We are seeing early signs of improvement in cost  optimization.
Sales effectiveness and delivery effectiveness will  take a little longer to deliver predictable revenue growth.
In 1981, when Infosys was founded, the retirement age  (for executive roles) was fixed at 60 years for Founders.
I will retire  when I turn 60 next year.
Shibulal is also set to retire early next  year.
Infosys has rigorous leadership transition processes in place.
The CEO transition is an important move that the Board has to act  on in the coming year.
With Murthy as Executive Chairman, the  risk in the transition is reduced.
Thus, we have major transitions happening simultaneously .
I am  confident that Infosys will be able to manage these and re‑establish  itself as a leader in the IT services business.
Evolving with changing times Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Next level of delivery excellence The former CTO of Microsoft, Ray Ozzie, once said, “I love  software, because if you can imagine something, you can build it.”  Having worked in the software industry for over two decades,  I can vouch for this.
Creating good software is a craft.
With 96%  of our projects delivered on time, and over 97% of our revenues  coming in as repeat business from satisfied clients, evidently this  craftsmanship has fueled the growth of Infosys over the years.
Today , the way businesses consume technology services is  changing.
Technology spends are no longer determined by a central  IT budget, but are an integral part of every line of business.
Traditional enterprise systems like compensation and benefits,  and corporate travel are increasingly being procured as a managed  business service, and consumed through a pay‑as‑you‑go model on  the cloud.
This service efficiency model involves multi‑disciplinary  teams, sometimes virtual, and combines business, technology , and  operations, into a single cohesive service offering.
At Infosys, we build next‑generation service delivery models  that drive efficiencies further.
Agile, and fortified with process  automation, tools, templates and accelerators, our delivery model  enables better project execution, reduces costs, and guarantees  enhanced business value.
Our market differentiators include : Infosys IT Service Management (ITSM) platform  : The ITSM  platform is an end‑to‑end solution that automates ticket resolution  and IT services management, resulting in improved resolution time  and quality .
ITSM has the potential to achieve over 25% services  automation.
Infosys Global Agile and VScrum methodology : Agile methodologies  in a co‑locational construct are meant to address scale and cost  benefits.
Infosys Global Agile and VScrum methodology enables  enterprise IT through a scalable execution of distributed agile  projects.
Co‑location is replaced by virtual stand‑ups, telepresence  and online forums.
Besides allowing distributed development, continuous integration,  and service virtualization, it also enables testing before the  completion of the entire solution.
Infosys Command Center framework  : Critical business flows  within enterprises assume seamless integration of application and  infrastructure across service providers.
However, siloed monitoring  is quite the norm.
We believe that proactive monitoring of business  events through data triggers and other non‑intrusive means can  ensure better preparedness to manage business events.
Infosys  Command Center provides a centralized framework to integrate  and monitor business flows of various IT monitoring systems,  service management tools and applications.
Today , Social Computing, Mobility , Analytics and Cloud, popularly  known as SMAC or Digital, is making significant innovations  not only in the consumer space, but also in the enterprise space.
We work with these emerging technologies independently as well  as collectively for the benefit of our clients : The Infosys Cloud Ecosystem Hub  : We help our clients establish  and manage a scalable, hybrid cloud ecosystem, by collaborating  with the right ecosystem partners to provide single‑point  accountability .
The Hub builds, manages and governs hybrid cloud  ecosystems seamlessly .
The Infosys BigDataEdge  : This solution helps enterprises in  analyzing Big Data to discover relevant information and develop  insights to make better business decisions in real‑time.
We believe that our focus on next‑generation service delivery will  help us take advantage of the shift in the industry .
Combining this  with our growing consulting business, our ability to influence and  participate in our clients' success will increase manifold.
U. B.
Pravin Rao President and Whole‑time Director Evolving with changing times Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Balance Sheet and beyond : Transactional to transformational Rajiv Bansal Chief Financial Officer From book‑keeping to strategy planning, from financial reporting  to risk management, from internal controls to global compliance —  the traditional role of the CFO has evolved over time, keeping pace  with the changing economic, business, and technology landscapes.
While the business implications of the role have expanded, the  CFO has graduated from being a financial controller to a strategic  business partner to the organization.
We are a new‑generation technology company with a predominantly  young workforce.
Consequently , our finance function is as much  about accounting regulation and compliance as it is about building  capability , embracing diversity , and strengthening stakeholder  relationships.
As our global footprint and service offerings expand,  there is a strong emphasis on decentralizing the finance function  and building capabilities across verticals and geographies.
The CFO is an active partner in the key decisions of the business  units and plays a pivotal role in stakeholder management too,  which includes investors, analysts, auditors, regulators, and  government agencies.
We engage with our investors and analysts  on a regular basis, and address their queries and often solicit their  feedback.
This feedback was helpful in the Board's recent decision  to increase the dividend payout ratio to up to 40% of post‑tax  profits effective fiscal 2014 — a decision that enhances returns for  our shareholders.
Our risk management practices seek to sustain and enhance our  long‑term competitive advantage.
Today's pervasive technology  environment has helped us create a comprehensive risk framework  and strategy that enable continuous assessments of controls,  changes in risk policies, certifications and audits.
The proliferation  of social media has spawned new business models and mechanisms  that help us gain faster access to our customers, vendors, investors  and stakeholders.
Worldwide, new regulations and compliance requirements are  being mandated more often.
The CFO needs to keep track of  the ever‑changing rules and regulations on financial reporting,  mandatory audit rotation, mergers and acquisitions, corporate  governance, related party transactions, employee compliances,  global mobility , currency volatility , corporate taxation and  corporate social responsibility .
During the reporting year, we embarked on an initiative to strengthen  our compliance program, covering applicable laws, rules and  regulations, across the globe.
We engaged with a global accounting  firm to define the compliance framework, validate our current  compliance requirements and operationalize our compliance  management processes.
We have enhanced our financial reporting  process by accounting for and reporting on environmental  factors such as carbon credits, greenhouse gas emissions, energy  consumption, and waste management.
Integrating these, as well as  social responsibility metrics, with our financial reporting has truly  expanded the scope of our Annual Report.
During uncertain times, managing liquidity and controlling  costs are crucial.
Yet, the equilibrium has to be maintained with  investments that augment growth while sustaining the morale of  the employees.
Over the last year, we have initiated some measures  to achieve higher cost‑optimization levels.
We are also happy  to report that our cash generation from operation remains very  healthy at 114% of our net profit (as per IFRS in US dollar terms),  and this has resulted in a highly liquid balance sheet.
We have  honored all our employee commitments and given two cycles of  promotions and a salary hike during the year.
As the role of the CFO expands to accommodate more than fiduciary  responsibilities, it is important to nurture analytical, strategic and  technical competencies to address the needs of all our stakeholders.
Evolving with changing times Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Ranganath D. Mavinakere  Senior Vice President – Chairman's Office Enhancing competitive advantage through cost optimization In the years following the 2008 financial crisis, large global  corporations have been focusing on increasing their agility and  competitiveness in the market through innovation and flexible  cost structure.
They are moving towards a leaner and more variable  cost structure.
Cost optimization is not viewed as a mere margin  improvement mechanism.
Instead, it is increasingly seen as a way  to improve the competitive advantage of a company .
For example,  global banks are focusing on reducing the cost‑to‑income ratio to  be competitive in the market.
In this context, it is important for all IT service providers to global  corporations to design innovative business solutions, which bring  down the total cost of ownership for their clients.
This is possible  only when IT service providers look at their own cost structure and  optimize to be competitive in the market.
A lower cost structure  helps in pricing the deals more competitively and winning them.
This will help clients reduce their total cost of ownership.
Further,  this will release more capital towards innovation.
In the service industry including IT services, typically , employee  cost is the biggest component, comprising about 70% to 80% of  the total operating cost.
Hence, it is important to deploy different  mechanisms to optimize this large component of operating cost.
There are several levers available for cost optimization that can  be used to bring down employee cost without causing friction  to the business.
These include increasing employee productivity  so that higher revenue is generated at the same cost, increasing  the offshore component of a project, improving the utilization  percentage, reducing the overheads in a project through a  broad‑based employee pyramid structure, optimizing business  support functions through process improvements and automation  of workflows.
During the year, we deployed several initiatives aimed at achieving  higher cost‑effectiveness.
These included streamlining business  support functions to reduce their cost of operations, improving the  utilization percentage of employees through an integrated talent  supply chain management and deployment of tools to measure and  improve individual productivity .
Further, initiatives to increase the  offshore component of work have been deployed.
Another focus  area has been the broad‑basing of the employee pyramid structure  by reducing overheads.
We optimized sub‑contractor deployment  to suit business needs and enhanced the effectiveness of cost  governance and review mechanisms at the business unit level.
While some of the above measures are expected to yield results in  the medium term, we have begun to see some change in the cost  structure during the current year, as reflected by an improvement  in the operating margin — from 23.5% (in US dollar terms) in Q1  FY 2014 to 25.5% in Q4 FY 2014.
In addition to increasing our competitive advantage in terms of  pricing power, cost optimization helps us invest more in the sales  function and make long‑term investments in building strong client  relationships.
Evolving with changing times Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 B. G. Srinivas  President and Whole‑time Director Maximizing value to win As the execution of our plans for the new fiscal year gathers  momentum, our clients are intensely focused on theirs.
Enterprises  the world over are transforming their business to be resilient to  short‑term knockbacks, but reshaped for long‑term growth, aiming  at radical innovation with methodical execution.
While economic recovery continues to be fragile, businesses are  beginning to feel optimistic.
Some are initiating large business  transformation programs with an aim to simplify , by consolidating  ERP landscapes, modernizing infrastructure and creating  alternative operating models with new partners.
Cost optimization  and enhanced agility are recurring themes in several of these  programs.
Clients in financial services are redirecting savings  from cost expenditures into the development of new products and  services, risk and compliance‑related spending, and modernization  of infrastructure and legacy applications.
In life sciences, leaders  are looking intently at variability of cost.
Seeking value from new technologies is another refrain I hear  often from business leaders across the world.
Infrastructure and  Cloud adoption remain key areas of spending for them from a cost  perspective, and for growth.
Digital transformation  — Social,  Mobile, Cloud and Big data / Analytics  — is an area of priority  spending for our clients in financial services, manufacturing and  retail segments.
I clearly see opportunities for us to help them  build new channels of revenue growth and improve their operating  models.
Our consulting capabilities, IP and platforms give us  a distinct edge.
I see a demand for ERP‑based transformation from the energy sector.
In manufacturing, there's an uptick in discretionary spending from  the automotive segment where clients saw record sales last year.
Clients are also leveraging IT for leaner R&D and engineering  services, creating more opportunities for us.
A standout example is  how an automotive major leveraged Flypp™ to create, launch and  monetize connected‑car apps.
The Infosys 3.0 strategy , designed to deliver superior client value,  offered a predictable, sustainable, profitable and de‑risked model  for our business.
It is apparent that our three‑pronged strategy —  outsourcing services, transformative consulting and intellectual  property creation — offers us the most resilient business model.
Our domain‑rich consulting front‑end helps us devise solutions  that deliver tangible business outcomes for clients.
Our annual revenue growth of 11.5% (in US dollar terms) in  the fiscal year ending March  31, 2014, is a significant step‑up  from the 5.8% growth rate of the previous fiscal.
There are more  opportunities to be harnessed through the efficiency of our growth  engines.
In the past year, we have embarked upon several initiatives  to accelerate growth.
They are focused on restructuring the  organization for agility by creating smaller and nimbler sales  regions to increase focus on underpenetrated markets and industry  segments; redesigning our supply chain function and enhancing the  speed of fulfilling fast‑changing market needs, renewing emphasis  on winning large outsourcing deals; enabling our sales teams  with a consultative mindset and better decision‑making systems;  attracting and retaining a high‑performing and multi‑cultural  sales force; and redesigning performance management systems  with greater emphasis on meritocracy and rewarding exceptional  performance.
It is heartening to see these initiatives gain traction in the market  while the journey continues.
Over the next two years, I expect  these interventions to enhance our competitiveness and enable us  to achieve industry‑leading growth.

We crossed revenues of `  50,000 cr ore (8 billion in US dollar  terms).
Further, in dollar terms, our revenue growth doubled to  11.5% in fiscal 2014 from 5.8% in fiscal 2013, while in rupee terms,  the year‑on‑year growth was 24.2%.
This was a year in which we  reaffirmed our commitment to all our stakeholders.
Our performance during the year exceeded our initial guidance.
At  the beginning of the year, our guidance stood at 6%  – 10%.
We  revised our guidance at the beginning of Q3 FY 2014 to  9% – 10%, which we subsequently revised upwards to 11.5% – 12%  at the beginning of Q4 FY 2014.
Our performance for the year was  therefore in line with the lower end of our most recent guidance.
As per the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),  our consolidated revenues in rupee terms for fiscal 2014 stood at  ` 50,133 cr ore. Out of the total revenue, North America and Europe  accounted for 60.7% and 24.4%, respectively .
India and the Rest  of the World contributed 2.6% and 12.3%, respectively .
The profit  after tax was ` 10,648 cr ore, a year‑on‑year growth of 13.0%.
In accordance with IFRS in US dollar terms, our annual revenue  for fiscal 2014 stood at $8,249 million, while the net income stood  at $1,751 million, a year‑on‑year growth of 1.5%.
Liquid assets  of the Company , comprising cash and cash equivalents, current  available‑for‑sale financial assets, investments in certificates of  deposit and quoted debt securities, stood at ` 30,251 crore at the  end of fiscal 2014, versus ` 23,958 cr ore at the end of fiscal 2013  on IFRS basis.
We are pleased to announce a final dividend of ` 43  per share for fiscal 2014.
Our clients are one of our most important stakeholders and we  strive to be consistently relevant to their changing business needs.
On a consolidated basis, we added 238 new clients, taking our  client base to 890.
We expanded our global footprint further this  fiscal, with a new delivery center in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.
We  commenced work on our new campuses in Indore, Mohali,  Noida, and Nagpur in India and in Araraquara in Brazil.
To enable our clients to anticipate and adapt to the ever‑changing  business environment, we have had to transform ourselves  internally many a time.
In recent years, we embarked on a strategy  that focuses on opportunities from three key streams  — first,  highly‑competitive, large revenue‑yielding outsourcing projects;  second, consulting‑led, end‑to‑end solutions leveraging technology  for higher margins; third, intellectual‑property‑based solutions, to  delink revenue from effort.
Over the past year, while we continued  to stay the course of that strategy , we sharpened its execution.
In  fiscal 2014, we increased our focus on the first stream while  ensuring that the second and third progress concurrently .
Our biggest assets are our employees.
Through their hard work,  passion and commitment to excellence, they help us differentiate  ourselves in the marketplace and realize our aspirations.
We added  39,985 employees to the Infosys family (net addition of 3,717).
The total employee strength as on March 31, 2014 was 1,60,405 for  Infosys and its subsidiaries.
Our vendor partners constitute another important stakeholder  group.
We manage our supply chain responsibly and work with  our suppliers to achieve business efficiencies.
We launched the  Supplier Code of Conduct in fiscal 2014 to further strengthen our  supply chain business practices.
While delivering value to our clients, we make sure that we do  not lose focus of the need to give back to society .
Through the  Infosys Foundation, we continue to expand our reach and make  a difference to society by empowering people and communities at  the bottom of the pyramid, and providing opportunities to improve  standards of living.
Our flagship industry‑academia partnership  program, Campus Connect, launched in 2004, works with  S. D. Shibulal Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 2 | Letter to the stakeholder 372  institutions today .
About 41,000 students and 1,476 faculty  members were benefitted by the program this year.
In October 2013, we concluded a civil settlement with the U.S.  Department of State, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and  the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that brought to a close  the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern  District of Texas relating to I‑9 paperwork errors and visa matters  involving the Company .
Although we exceeded our initial guidance and feel encouraged  as our growth rate doubled, we believe that the results are below  the benchmarks that we set for ourselves.
To get back on the  path of industry‑leading performance that is expected of us, we  have embarked on three strategic initiatives  — to increase sales  effectiveness, to  improve our delivery efficiency and to enhance  our cost competitiveness.
Our practices, partnerships and innovations won us many accolades  this fiscal.

We reorganized ourselves  into eight business segments : Financial Ser vices; Insurance; Energy  and Communications; Life Sciences and Healthcare; Resources and  Utilities; Manufacturing; Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and  Logistics; and Growth Markets.
In January this year, we adopted a two‑president structure by  elevating B.  G.  Srinivas and U.
B.  Pravin  Rao as Presidents.
B. G. Srinivas will focus on global markets and U. B.
Pravin Rao  will focus on global delivery and service innovation.
The Executive  Council ceased to exist from April 1, 2014.
As you are aware, in June, 2013, the Board requested Narayana  Murthy to take over as the Executive Chairman of the Board,  and he agreed.
The Board also inducted three new members  —  U. B.
Pravin Rao, Kiran Mazumdar‑Shaw , and Carol M. Browner.
All three bring to the table a wealth of experience and insights that  will enrich the Company in many ways.
I would like to take this opportunity to share another exciting  update with you.
Starting this year, we are publishing our Annual  Report in a new integrated format.
The ‘Integrated Annual Report  2014’ is our first attempt to provide a holistic report encompassing  economic, social and environmental parameters.
Our reporting  framework fits the broader process of setting organizational strategy ,  implementing action plans, and assessing outcomes.
This report  complies with the mandatory listing requirement of the Securities  and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and is in line with the nine  principles enunciated in the National Voluntary Guidelines on  Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business.
Our ‘Sustainability Report’ provides detailed information on our  responsible business practices across these three parameters in  accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative G4 framework.
We have been through a period of external and internal challenges  in the last three years.
Externally , we were facing legal and regulatory  challenges, investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and  increased regulatory scrutiny .
Internally , we were embarking on  a new strategic direction and transitioning from Infosys  2.0 to  Infosys  3.0.
A new organizational structure and leadership were  just settling into place.
Today , all these challenges are behind us and the investigation by  the Department of Justice has been concluded.
The Infosys 3.0  transition is complete and well ‑received by our clients, who have  reposed their confidence in us.
The new organizational structure  and leadership are firmly in place.
Our revenue growth this year has  doubled from the last fiscal, and margins are on the right trajectory .
As we prepare for the future, we strongly believe that these changes  will help us stay agile and relevant to changing client priorities.
We could not agree more with George Bernard Shaw who said,  “Progress is impossible without change.” In the year ahead, we  foresee exciting times for us and for the industry .
We also foresee  change.
With your trust and support, we are confident that we will  continue to evolve with the changing times.
As I write my last communication in the Annual Report as CEO  and MD, I cannot help reflecting on the challenges we have faced  since our earliest days as a technology services company .
These  challenges have only made us more resilient.
I have had my own  share of challenges over the past three years.
I feel happy that I have  addressed these challenges head ‑on and will be leaving behind a  stronger and more dynamic Infosys.

2. Business Strategy During the year, we continued to work on the vision articulated in  the Infosys 3.0 strategy and also strengthened focus on our core  competence area of Business IT Services (BITS).
We also continued to  explore and invest in the products and platforms space.
Given the very  different R&D environment demanded by products and platforms,  and the objective of delinking revenues from person‑month effort, the  Board approved the transfer of the existing Products, Platforms and  Solutions business (excluding Finacle) to a wholly‑owned subsidiary  of Infosys Limited.
The new subsidiary has been named Edgeverve  Systems Limited.
Edgeverve Systems Limited is a related party as  defined under the Companies Act, 2013.
The transaction requires  members' approval by way of special resolution and hence the Board  has decided to seek the members' approval at the ensuing AGM.
We also introduced a number of strategic initiatives during the fiscal  year to spur overall growth and productivity in the Company .
The  following are some of the broad areas covered by these initiatives : Cost optimization : A series of measures have been initiated to yield  high levels of cost optimization.
These include focusing on location  optimization, increasing offshore effort ratios, deploying people in the  right jobs and eliminating unnecessary costs.
Enhancing sales productivity : We are focusing on reinvigorating our  sales teams and enabling them with better systems, training, processes  and metrics.
This will help us in winning large revenue yielding  multi‑year outsourcing projects.
Improving delivery effectiveness  :  Our software delivery has always  been of a high order, and we want to re‑focus on strengthening it  further.
We are developing intellectual property (IP)‑based solutions  to delink revenue from effort and focusing on improving individual  work productivity .
Organizational changes Dynamic challenges faced by businesses today require companies  to evolve with changing times to remain competitive.
As part of the  organizational changes that were implemented during fiscal year  2014, our Board adopted a two‑president governance structure for  the Company and appointed B. G. Srinivas and U. B.
Pravin Rao as  Presidents of the Company , reporting to the Chief Executive Officer  and Managing Director, S. D. Shibulal, effective January 3, 2014.
Following the appointment of the Presidents, the Executive Council  ceased to exist with effect from April 1, 2014.

To strengthen our focus on growing existing  client relationships and increasing market share through service  differentiation and operational agility , changes have been made in  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 8 | Directors' report our organizational structure.

Re‑appointments As per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, B. G. Srinivas and  S. Gopalakrishnan will retire in the ensuing AGM and being eligible,  seek re ‑appointment.
The Board of Directors recommend their  re‑appointment.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 12 | Directors' report The Companies Act, 2013 provides for appointment of independent  directors.
Sub‑section (10) of Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013  (effective April 1, 2014) provides that independent directors shall hold  office for a term of up to five consecutive years on the Board of a  company; and shall be eligible for re‑appointment on passing a special  resolution by the shareholders of the company .
Sub‑section (11) states that no independent director shall be eligible  for more than two consecutive terms of five years.
Sub ‑section (13)  states that the provisions of retirement by rotation as defined in  sub‑sections (6) and (7) of Section 152 of the Act shall not apply to  such independent directors.
Our non‑executive (independent) directors (except for Kiran  Mazumdar‑Shaw and Carol M. Browner) were appointed as directors  liable to retire by rotation under the provisions of the erstwhile  Companies Act, 1956.
The Board of Directors has been advised that  non‑executive (independent) directors so appointed would continue  to serve the term that was ascertained at the time of appointment as  per the resolution pursuant to which they were appointed.
Therefore,  it  stands to reason that only those non‑executive (independent)  directors who will complete their present term at the ensuing AGM of  the Company in June 2014, being eligible and seeking re‑appointment,  be considered by the shareholders for re‑appointment for a term of up  to five consecutive years.
Non‑executive (independent) directors who do not complete their  term at the ensuing AGM, will continue to hold office till the expiry  of their term (based on retirement period calculation) and thereafter  would be eligible for re ‑appointment for a fixed term in accordance  with the Companies Act, 2013.

Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Directors' report | 13  As per the Companies Act, 2013, all companies having net worth of  ` 500 cr ore or more, or turnover of ` 1,000 cr ore or more or a net  profit of ` 5 cr ore or more during any financial year will be required  to constitute a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee of the  Board of Directors comprising three or more directors, at least one of  whom will be an independent director.
Aligning with the guidelines, we have constituted a committee  comprising K.  V .
Kamath (Chairperson) , R.  Seshasayee, Kiran  Mazumdar‑Shaw and S. D. Shibulal.
The committee is responsible  for formulating and monitoring the CSR policy of the Company .
The committee has adopted a policy that intends to : •	Strive for economic development that positively impacts the society  at large with a minimal resource footprint.
•	Be responsible for the corporation's actions and encourage a positive  impact through its activities on the environment, communities and  stakeholders.
CSR activities, as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013,  can be undertaken by the Company through a registered trust or a  registered society .
In 1996, Infosys set up the Infosys Foundation (‘the  Foundation’) as a not‑for‑profit trust.
The Foundation will work closely  with and support the Board and the committee in our CSR activities.
The Foundation will assist the committee in identifying the areas of  CSR activities, programs and execution of initiatives as per predefined  guidelines.
The Foundation will also assist the Board and the committee  in reporting progress of deployed initiatives and in making appropriate  disclosures (internal / external) on a periodic basis.
Infosys Foundation Infosys Foundation was established in 1996 as a not‑for‑profit trust  through which we could channelize our social welfare initiatives.
Over the years, the Foundation has initiated, guided and conducted  several programs in education, healthcare, disaster relief and rural  development, and has been successful in bringing about a positive  change in the lives of the underprivileged sections of society .
The Foundation has also been a major patron of the arts and has  supported several endangered art forms.
In fiscal year 2014, the Foundation's work spanned a wide range of  development areas, including offering scholarships to disadvantaged  students, funding school buildings and libraries, aiding drinking  water projects in remote villages and rehabilitating street children and  devadasis (a marginalized community in South India).
The Foundation  received ` 9 cr ore as grant from Infosys Limited in fiscal year 2014.
A more detailed report on the Foundation's activities during fiscal  year 2014 forms part of our Sustainability Report, available on our  website, www.infosys.com.
We would like to thank the honorary trustees of the Foundation,  who continue to devote their valuable time and energy to planning,  directing and monitoring its activities.
The Association for Computing Machinery – Infosys  Foundation Award The Association for Computing Machinery  – Infosys Foundation  Award in Computing Sciences was established in August 2007.
ACM (www.acm.org) is the world's largest educational and scientific  computing society , uniting computing educators, researchers and  professionals.
The Infosys Foundation made an endowment to institute  this award, which carries a prize of US $175,000.
David Blei, Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science  at Princeton University , is the recipient of the 2013 ACM‑Infosys  Foundation Award in Computing Sciences.
Prof.  Blei initiated an  approach to analyzing large collections of data using innovative statistical  methods, known as ‘topic modeling’, that make it possible to organize  and summarize digital archives on a scale that would be impossible  through human annotation.
Sustainability initiatives Our sustainability charter is driven by our core values and ethics.
Our sustainability actions are streamlined on the three themes — Social  contract, Resource intensity and Green innovation.
The highlights of  our initiatives on the three themes are as follows : Social contract •	Fostering innovation in the societies where we operate is important  to inspire and celebrate innovators and their innovations.
We  partnered with TV18, a leading provider of business news  on Indian television, to present Innovating for a Better Tomorrow,  a unique tele‑series that showcased 14 exemplary innovations that  have not only transformed the lives of millions of Indians but have  made indelible impressions globally .
•	Our unique initiative, Health Assessment and Lifestyle Enrichment  (HALE) received the silver recognition at the ‘Express IT Awards’  2013.
•	The Infosys Foundation supported the construction of Isha  Vidyalaya School in Tamil Nadu and KIMS Hospital in Hubli,  Karnataka, during fiscal year 2014.
•	We launched a policy advocacy statement last fiscal year to influence  positive and affirmative sustainability actions across the globe.
Resource intensity •	We have set up robust processes to manage greenhouse gases (GHG)  effectively .
Through constant monitoring and rigorous sustainability  practices, we have been able to reduce the Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions by 59.3% as compared to fiscal year 2008.
Note:  Scope 1 covers fuel, hydr ochloroflurocarbons, SF6 and emissions from  company‑owned vehicles and Scope 2 covers electricity.
•	We achieved a reduction by 43.6% in our per capita electricity  consumption as compared to fiscal year 2008.
•	We were able to reduce our water intensity by 34.5% as compared  to fiscal year 2008.
•	We used 75.6 million units of electricity from renewable sources  in fiscal year 2014.
•	10.1 MW in connected load was reduced through retrofits over the  last three years.
•	As of fiscal year 2014, 3.4 million sq.
ft. of our built‑up area has  received the highest level of green building rating.
•	We installed 2MW of solar photovoltaic plants at our campuses  between 2012 and 2014.
Green innovation •	We deployed a Dynamic Storage Tier technology which helped us  limit storage infrastructure, accompanying data center power and  cooling requirements while increasing the capacity .
In addition,  it helped improve our enterprise storage performance by 95% with  cost savings and performance improvements.
•	Our research labs, Infosys Labs, developed the Infosys Electronic  Signature Solution (iESS) that enables easy and seamless integration  of digital signature support into enterprise approval workflows  replacing the need for manual signatures.
This has not only reduced  paper usage for some of our government and banking clients, but  has also enhanced security and regulatory compliance.
•	We also revisited our model of handling customer‑loaned assets  constituting equipment to the tune of US $1.5 billion, which  traditionally had to be shipped back at the end of project closure.
By liaising with the government for necessary policy changes and  building internal processes and checks, we were able to change  the utilization drastically .
The cost of shipping the assets back was  eliminated for the client, and our ability to scale infrastructure was  improved.
We were able to enhance our loaned asset reconciliation  for disposal as e‑waste, and achieve reduction in energy and fuel  expenditure.

Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Directors' report | 15  Annexure to the directors' report a) P articulars pursuant to Companies (Disclosure of particulars in the report of the Board of Directors) Rules, 1988 Conservation of energy We continue to strengthen our energy‑conservation efforts.
We have  received the LEED Platinum rating (highest level) from the Indian  Green Building Council (IGBC) for five of our new buildings (one each  in Mangalore, Mysore and Pune, and two in Hyderabad).
We now have  10 LEED Platinum‑rated buildings and two buildings with GRIHA  5‑star rating, making a total of about 3.4 million sq.
ft. with green  certification — the highest in India for office buildings.
This year, we have reduced our per capita electricity consumption  by 6.17%.
We have been able to do this through integrated design  principles applied to our new buildings, retrofitting our existing  buildings and optimizing operations.
Over the past three years, we have  re‑engineered our air conditioning plants to the highest efficiency levels  and we have achieved a reduction of 10.1 MW in the connected load.
We used over 75 million units of electricity from renewable sources  (off‑site and on ‑site) during this fiscal.
We have an installed solar  power plant capacity of 2 MW , spread over our campuses in Chennai,  Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Jaipur.
Our water conservation strategy encompasses rainwater harvesting,  use of water efficient fixtures for our buildings and 100% recycling of  waste water.
The highlights for this year is a 40 million‑liter capacity  lake in Mysore for harvesting rainwater and installation of about  15,000 pressure compensating aerators in the water faucets in most  of our campuses to reduce water usage.
This year, we have reduced  our per capita water consumption by about 1.04%.
We have installed biogas plants in our Mangalore and Hyderabad  campuses to process food waste from the food courts and  generate biogas that will be used in the food court kitchens.
Composting facilities have been installed in our campuses in  Bangalore, Jaipur and Chandigarh.
We have installed a CFL  crusher in our Bangalore campus to ensure recovery of hazardous  mercury from CFLs.

IT infrastructure Our operations are less energy‑intensive than industries in the  manufacturing sector.
However, significant measures are taken to  reduce energy consumption by using energy‑efficient IT equipment.
We have included energy efficiency as one of our key IT architecture  strategies and have adopted the latest technology concepts.
Our measures include the following : Desktop power management  : We have deployed and optimized a  desktop power management configuration tool which is designed to  auto‑schedule shutdown of desktops.
Terminator, a tool developed  in‑house, is deployed as a desktop power management configuration  tool.
It is designed to auto‑schedule shutdown of desktops.
It uses an  alert mechanism for users to shut down their computers after work  hours, and automatically shuts down the machine at the pre‑defined  time.
We also replaced around 12,600 older desktops with newer,  more power‑efficient versions this year, as part of our asset‑efficiency  initiative.
Virtualization and consolidation : Continuing the adoption of the latest  technology concepts such as virtualization, consolidation and cloud to  reduce the physical footprint of our servers, we have further expanded  our internal private cloud capacity , with MyCloud.
Used for software  development and testing purposes, MyCloud now has a capacity of  around 8,500 virtual machines.
Around 30% of instances provisioned  on MyCloud this year were addressed through virtual machines that  were released, facilitating a seamless reuse.
We have continued to  expand our Network‑Attached Storage (NAS) ‑based virtualization  this year.
We have virtualized 39% of NAS filers, resulting in a  reduction of 29% in the power demand of NAS boxes.
In addition,  we have deployed tools which automatically check and shut down idle  project‑specific servers, yielding higher power savings.
Data centers and server rooms : We have standardized and incorporated  eco‑friendly designs for these rooms to ensure a reduction in our power  consumption.
We have revamped and released around 800 sq.
ft. of  server room / laboratory space this year.
We have optimized our air  conditioning usage using hot / cold aisle separation and custom‑made  cages for consolidation of racks.
Recently , we have moved to a tier‑3  data center in Australia, which has attained a high standard of power  usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.4 and includes features like partial  powering by solar energy and rain water usage in cooling towers,  resulting in up to 25% of power consumption reduction.
Video / audio conferencing  : Our video and audio conferencing  (VC and AC) usage has increased steadily this year too, indirectly  cutting down the travel requirements of our employees.
We have  doubled our VC capacity and have rolled out a new plug‑in for  self‑booking.
This has resulted in a sizable increase in our VC usage by  more than 100% compared to last year.
Our audio‑conference usage  has increased by around 13% since last year.

I I ndustry structure and developments Changing economic and business conditions, evolving consumer  preferences, rapid technological innovation and adoption and  globalization are creating an increasingly competitive market  environment that is driving corporations to transform the manner in  which they operate.
Companies in this environment are now focusing  even more on their core business objectives, such as revenue growth,  profitability and asset efficiency .
Technology has evolved from merely driving cost efficiency .
It is now  also driving tangible business value.
The ability to define, design,  develop, implement and maintain advanced technology platforms and  business solutions to address business needs has become a competitive  advantage and a priority for corporations worldwide.
As a result, there is an increasing need for highly‑skilled professionals  in the market to help corporations transform their business, optimize  operations and drive innovation by leveraging technology .
At the same  time, enterprises are reluctant to expand their internal IT departments  and increase costs.
These factors have led to the increased reliance  of corporations on their outsourcing providers and are expected to  continue to drive future growth for outsourced technology services.
1.
I ncreasing trend towards offshore technology  services Corporations are increasingly turning to offshore service providers to  meet their need for higher quality and cost‑competitive technology  solutions.
As a result, offshore service providers have become critical  to the operations of many enterprises and these service providers  continue to grow in recognition and sophistication.
In view of this,  the addressable market for offshore technology services has expanded.
2.
T he India advantage India is widely recognized as the premier destination for offshore  technology services.
According to the NASSCOM press release issued  in February 2014, IT‑BPM services export revenues from India are  expected to grow to US $97 – $99 billion in fiscal year 2015, a growth  of 13% – 15% over fiscal year 2014.
Domestic revenues are estimated  to grow to ` 1,250 – ` 1,280 billion in fiscal year 2015, which is a   growth of 9% – 12% compared to fiscal year 2014.
3.
E volution of technology outsourcing The nature of technology outsourcing is changing.
Historically ,  enterprises either outsourced their technology requirements entirely ,  or on a standalone, project‑by‑project basis.
In an environment of  rapid technological change, globalization and regulatory changes,  the complete outsourcing model is often perceived to limit a company's  operational flexibility and not fully deliver potential cost savings and  efficiency benefits.
Similarly , project‑by‑project outsourcing is also  perceived to result in increased operational risk and coordination  costs and as failing to leverage technology service providers' full  range of capabilities.
To address these issues, companies are looking at  outsourcing approaches that require their technology service providers  to develop specialized systems, processes and solutions along with  cost‑effective delivery capabilities.

Global D elivery Model Our Global Delivery Model allows us to take work to the location where  the best talent is available, produce where it is most cost‑effective and  sell where it is most profitable with the least amount of acceptable risk.
Our Global Delivery Model enables us to derive maximum benefit  from : •	Our large pool of highly‑skilled technology professionals •	24‑hour execution capabilities across multiple time zones •	The ability to accelerate delivery times of large projects by  simultaneously processing project components •	The cost competitiveness across geographic regions •	The built‑in redundancy to ensure uninterrupted services •	A knowledge management system that enables us to reuse solutions  where appropriate In a typical offshore development project, we assign a team of our  technology professionals to visit a client's site to determine the scope  and requirements of the project.
Once the initial specifications of  the project have been established, our project managers return  to the relevant global development center to supervise a larger  team of technology professionals dedicated to the development or  implementation of the solution.
T ypically , a small team remains at  the client's site to manage project coordination and address changes  in requirements as the project progresses.
Teams return to the  client's site when necessary to ensure seamless integration.
To the  extent required, a dedicated team provides ongoing maintenance  from our development centers.
The client's systems are linked to  our facilities, enabling simultaneous processing in our development  centers.
Our model ensures that project managers remain in control  of execution throughout the life of the project, regardless of their  geographical location.
We have successfully executed projects at all our development centers  globally .
The Group has 93 development centers globally , of which  36 are located in India, 18 in North and South America, 20 in the  Asia‑Pacific region and 19 in Europe.
Our largest development centers  are located in India.
On a consolidated basis, approximately 74.8%  Management's discussion and analysis Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 28 | Management's discussion and analysis of the total billed person months for our efforts rendered during  fiscal year 2014 originated from our global development centers in  India, with the balance efforts being rendered at client sites and our  development centers located outside India.
Our Global Delivery Model mitigates risks associated with providing  offshore technology services to our clients.
For our communication  needs, we use multiple service providers and a mix of terrestrial and  optical fiber links with alternate routing.
In India, we rely on two  telecommunication carriers to provide high‑speed links connecting  our development centers.
Internationally , we rely on multiple links  on submarine cable paths provided by various service providers to  connect our Indian global development centers with network hubs  in other parts of the world.
Our significant investment in redundant  infrastructure enables provisioning of uninterrupted service to  our clients.

D eferred tax assets / liabilities in ` crore Particulars Standalone Consolidated 2014 2013 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets 542 378 629 469 Deferred tax liabilities – 56 – 56 Deferred tax assets primarily comprise deferred taxes on fixed assets,  unavailed leave, trade receivables, accrued compensation to employees  and other provisions which are not tax‑deductible in the current year.
The movement in deferred tax liabilities is on account of the decrease  in provision for branch profit tax for our overseas branches.
We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered  from future taxable income.
We believe it is more likely than not that  we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities have  been offset wherever the Group has a legally enforceable right to set  off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities  and where the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax  liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .

IV Oppor tunities and threats 1.
O ur strengths We believe our competitive strengths include leadership in delivering  sophisticated solutions that enable clients in turn to deliver improved  business results in addition to optimizing the efficiency of their  business, our proven Global Delivery Model, commitment to quality  and process execution, strong brand and long‑standing client  relationships, status as an employer of choice, ability to scale, innovate  and lead makes us a competitive player.
2.
O ur strategy We seek to further strengthen our position as a leading global  consulting and outsourcing company by : •	Strengthening our strategic partnership with our clients •	Increasing our relevance to clients by being able to work in the  entire spectrum of their business •	Delivering higher business value to clients through the alignment of  our structure and offerings to their business objectives.
To achieve these goals, we seek to increase business from existing  and new clients, continue to enhance our engagement models and  offerings, expand geographically , continue to develop deep industry  knowledge, pursue alliances and strategic acquisitions, enhance brand  visibility and continue to invest in infrastructure and employees.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 36 | Management's discussion and analysis 3.
O ur competition We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly‑changing market and  compete with : •	Consulting firms such as Accenture Limited, Atos Origin S.A.,  Capgemini S.A., and Deloitte Consulting LLP •	Divisions of large multinational technology firms such as  Hewlett‑Packard Company and IBM Corporation •	IT outsourcing firms such as Computer Sciences Corporation, and  Dell Perot Systems •	Offshore technology services firms such as Cognizant Technology  Solutions Corporation, Tata Consultancy Services Limited,  Wipro Technologies Limited and HCL Technologies •	Software firms such as Oracle Corporation and SAP AG •	BPO firms such as Genpact Limited, Exl Service Holdings and WNS  Global Services •	In‑house IT departments of large corporations •	Specialty platform and SaaS companies For larger projects, we typically compete with other technology  services providers in response to requests for proposals.
Clients often  cite our Global Delivery Model, comprehensive end‑to‑end solutions,  ability to scale, superior quality and process execution, industry  expertise, experienced management team, talented professionals, track  record and competitive pricing as reasons for awarding us contracts.
In the future, we expect intensified competition from some of the firms  above, and may also experience competition from new companies.
In  particular, we expect increased competition from firms that  strengthen their offshore presence in India or other low‑cost locations  and from firms in market segments that we have recently entered.
We understand that price alone cannot constitute a sustainable  competitive advantage.
We believe that the principal competitive  factors in our business are : •	Attracting and retaining high‑quality management, technology  professionals, and sales personnel •	Articulating and demonstrating long‑term value to potential  customers •	Effectively integrating onsite and offshore execution capabilities to  deliver high‑quality , seamless, scalable, cost‑effective services •	Increasing the scale and breadth of service offerings to provide  one‑stop solutions for customer needs •	Keeping pace with ever‑changing technology and customer  requirements •	Strong and well‑recognized brand •	Proven track record of performance excellence and customer  satisfaction •	Financial strength to be able to invest in personnel and infrastructure  to support the evolving demands of customers •	High ethical and corporate governance standards to ensure honest  and professional business practices and protect the reputation of  the Company and its customers We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.

•	Our engagements with customers are singular in nature and do not  necessarily provide for subsequent engagements.
•	Our client contracts are often conditioned on our performance,  which, if unsatisfactory , could result in lower revenues than  previously anticipated.
•	Some of our long‑term client contracts contain benchmarking  provisions which, if triggered, could result in lower future revenues  and profitability under the contract.
•	Our increasing work with government agencies may expose us to  additional risks.
•	Our business will suffer if we fail to anticipate and develop new  services and enhance existing services in order to keep pace with  rapid changes in technology and in the industries on which we focus.

•	In the event that the Government of India or the government of  another country changes its tax policies in a manner that is adverse to  us, our tax expense may materially increase, reducing our profitability .
•	We operate in jurisdictions that impose transfer pricing and other  tax‑related regulations on us, and any failure to comply could  materially and adversely affect our profitability .

The corporate performance objectives with  the performance metrics and targets to be achieved during the year are  encapsulated in the corporate scorecard.
The corporate performance is  measured, monitored and managed on an on‑going basis.
The focus of risk management is to assess risks to the achievement of  key business objectives as enunciated in the corporate scorecard and  to deploy mitigation measures.
The periodic review meetings of the  Risk Management Committee and the Risk Council focus on reviewing  risks to the achievement of key business objectives and actions taken  to mitigate them.
3.
R isk categories The following broad categories of risks to the business objectives have  been considered in our risk management framework : •	Strategy : Risks originating from the choices we make on markets,  business mix, resources and delivery models can potentially  impact our competitive advantage in the medium and long term.
Risks related to scalability and sustainability of our business might  also have an impact on our business.
•	Industry : Risks relating to inherent characteristics of our industry  including, competitive structure, emergence of new business  models, technological landscape, extent of linkage to economic  environment and regulatory structure.
•	Counterparty : Risks arising from our association with entities for  conducting business.
The counterparties include clients, vendors,  alliance partners and their respective industries.
Apart from credit  risk, counterparty risks include those relating to litigation and loss  of reputation.

4.
Key r isk management practices The key risk management practices include those relating to identifying  key risks to our business objectives, impact assessment, risk analysis,  risk evaluation, risk reporting and disclosures, risk mitigation and  monitoring, and integration with strategy and business planning.
Risk identification and impact assessment  : Mechanisms for  identification and prioritization of risks include risk survey , industry  benchmarking, incident analysis, business risk environment  scanning, and focused discussions with the Risk Council and the Risk  Management Committee.
Risk register and internal audit findings also  provide inputs for risk identification and assessment.
Risk survey of  executives across units, functions and subsidiaries is conducted on an  annual basis to seek inputs on key risks.
Further, periodic assessment  of business risk environment is carried out to identify significant  risks to the achievement of business objectives and prioritizing the  risks for action.
Scenario‑based risk assessments are also carried out.
Operational risks are assessed primarily on three dimensions, namely ,  strength of underlying controls, compliance to policies and procedures  and business process effectiveness.
Risk evaluation  : Risk evaluation is carried out to decide the  significance of risks to the Company .
Estimated risks are compared  against the established risk criteria.
The risk criteria include key focus  areas namely : strategy , growth, cost, talent, reputation, leadership, and  regulatory compliance.
Risk reporting and disclosures  : Risks to the achievement of key  business objectives, trend line of risk level, impact and mitigation  actions are reported and discussed with the Risk Council and Risk  Management Committee on a periodic basis.
Key external and  internal incidents with potential impact are reported and reviewed  at appropriate forums such as the Information Security Council.
Risks relating to client project execution and client account‑level risks  are reported and discussed at appropriate levels within the Company .
Periodic update is provided to the Board highlighting key risks,  their impact and mitigation actions.
Key risk factors are disclosed in  regulatory filings.
Risk mitigation and monitoring : For identified top risks, dashboards  are created that track external and internal indicators relevant for risks  to indicate the risk level and its likelihood of occurrence.
The trend  line assessment of top risks, analysis of exposure and potential impact  are carried out periodically .
Mitigation plans are finalized, owners  are identified and progress of mitigation actions are monitored and  reviewed.
Further, for those business objectives, whose achievement  is at risk, periodic reviews are conducted to deploy actions.
Integration with strategy and business planning  : Identified risks to  the business objectives in the near‑ term, medium ‑ term and long ‑ term  are used as one of the key inputs for the development of strategy and  annual business plan.
Key strategic initiatives are identified to mitigate  specific risks.
C. R isk management highlights Our risk management practices continue to focus on minimizing  adverse impact of risks on our key business objectives relating  to growth, profitability , talent engagement, operational efficiency ,  reputation, regulatory compliance and to enable the Company to  leverage market opportunities effectively .
We continued our focus  on mitigating talent management related risks relating to supply  chain, both onsite and offshore, attraction, retention, engagement  and competency development.
Key developments in the regulatory  environment relating to visas, impact of immigration bills in the  countries we operate and their potential impact required close  monitoring and actions.
Impact of risks relating to reputation, our  competitive position and differentiation in market segments and  volatile currency movements also required continuous focus during  the year.
Periodic reviews of our business momentum relative to  competition and competitive position in key markets were conducted  and actions were deployed in this regard.
Our active management of  currency risks minimized the impact in a volatile currency market.
During the year, key leading external indicators in the United  States showed improvement and macro environment in Europe  showed stability in the second half leading to appreciation of  respective currencies.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Accounting Standards referred to in sub‑section (3C) of section 211 of  the Companies Act, 1956 (‘the Act’) read with the General Circular 15/2013 dated 13 September 2013 of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in  respect of Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures  selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation  of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the financial statements give the information  required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India : (i) in the case of the balance sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2014; (ii) in the case of the statement of profit and loss, of the profit for the year ended on that date; and (iii) in the case of the cash flow statement, of the cash flows for the year ended on that date.

1 Sig nificant accounting policies 1.1 Basis of pr eparation of financial statements The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed by the Companies  (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006, the provisions of the Companies  Act, 2013 (to the extent notified), the Companies Act, 1956 (to  the extent applicable), and guidelines issued by the Securities and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been  consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard  is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard  requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
1.2 U se of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures relating  to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial statements and  reported amounts of income and expenses during the period.
Examples  of such estimates include computation of percentage of completion  which requires the Company to estimate the efforts or costs expended  to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to be expended,  provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations under employee  retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post‑sales customer support  and the useful lives of fixed tangible assets and intangible assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in  estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in  circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates are  reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes  are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the  financial statements.
1.3 R evenue recognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are either  on a fixed‑price, fixed‑timeframe or on a time‑and‑material basis.
Revenue on time‑and‑material contracts are recognized as the related  services are performed, and revenue from the end of the last billing  to the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled revenues.
Revenue  from fixed‑price and fixed‑timeframe contracts, where there is no  uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration,  is recognized based upon the percentage of completion method.
When there is uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability ,  revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as unbilled revenue  while billings in excess of cost and earnings are classified as unearned  revenue.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed‑price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based upon  the percentage of completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives  to customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Company recognizes  the liability based on its estimate of the customer's future purchases.
If it is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or  if the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then discount is  not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can be  estimated reliably .
The Company recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts using a cumulative catchup  approach.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as direct  payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from the  Company and is determined as the difference between the sale price  and carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized  ratably on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized  using the time‑proportion method, based on rates implicit in the  transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Company's right  to receive dividend is established.
1.4 P rovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company  has a present legal obligation that can be estimated reliably , and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
1.5 P ost‑sales client support and warranties The Company provides its clients with a fixed‑period warranty for  corrections of errors and telephone support on all its fixed‑price,  fixed‑timeframe contracts.
Costs associated with such support  services are accrued at the time when related revenues are recorded  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Standalone financial statements | 49  and included in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company  estimates such costs based on historical experience and the estimates  are reviewed annually for any material changes in assumptions.
1.6 Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower  than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under  the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost  of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling  the contract.
1.7 T angible assets, intangible assets and capital  work‑in‑progress Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until fixed assets are  ready for use.
Capital work‑in‑progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and impairment.
1.8 D epreciation and amortization Depreciation on fixed assets is provided on the straight‑line method over  the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation  for assets purchased / sold during a period is proportionately charged.
Individual low cost assets (acquired for ` 5,000/‑ or less) ar e depreciated  over a period of one year from the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets  are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on  a straight‑line basis, commencing from the date the asset is available  to the Company for its use.
The Management estimates the useful lives  for the other fixed assets as follows : Buildings 15 years Plant and machinery 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment 2 – 5 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed at each reporting date.
1.9 Impairment The Management periodically assesses using, external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is  higher of the asset's net selling price and value in use, which means  the present value of future cash flows is expected to arise from the  continuing use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment  loss for an asset is reversed if, and only if, the reversal can be related  objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was  recognized.
The carrying amount of an asset is increased to its revised  recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed  the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any  accumulated amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss  been recognized for the asset in prior years.
1.10 R etirement benefits to employees Gratuity The Company provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan  (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering eligible employees.
The Gratuity Plan  provides a lump‑sum payment to vested employees at retirement,  death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount  based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of  employment with the Company .
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial  valuation at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit  method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained liabilities to the  Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust (the Trust).
Trustees  administer contributions made to the Trust and contributions are  invested in specific investments as permitted by the law.
The Company  recognizes the net obligation of the gratuity plan in the Balance Sheet  as an asset or liability , respectively in accordance with Accounting  Standard (AS) 15, ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Company's overall  expected long‑term rate‑of‑return on assets has been determined based  on consideration of available market information, current provisions  of Indian law specifying the instruments in which investments can  be made, and historical returns.
The discount rate is based on the  Government securities yield.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from  experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  they arise.
Superannuation Certain employees of Infosys are also participants in the superannuation  plan (‘the Plan’) which is a defined contribution plan.
The Company  has no obligations to the Plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Provident fund Eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is  a defined benefit plan.
Both the employee and the Company make  monthly contributions to the Provident Fund Plan equal to a specified  percentage of the covered employee's salary .
The Company contributes  a part of the contributions to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident  Fund Trust.
The remaining portion is contributed to the government  administered pension fund.
The rate at which the annual interest is  payable to the beneficiaries by the Trust is being administered by  the government.
The Company has an obligation to make good the  shortfall, if any , between the return from the investments of the Trust  and the notified interest rate.
Compensated absences The employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences  which are both accumulating and non‑accumulating in nature.
The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined  by actuarial valuation based on the additional amount expected to be  paid as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at  the Balance Sheet date.
Expense on non‑accumulating compensated  absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.
1.11 R esearch and development Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits  are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete  and use or sell the software, and the costs can be measured reliably .
1.12 F oreign currency transactions Foreign‑currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are  translated at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date.
The gains  or losses resulting from such translations are included in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
Non‑monetary assets and non‑monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value  was determined.
Non‑monetary assets and non‑monetary liabilities  denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost  are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction.
Revenue, expense and cash‑flow items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the date  of the transaction.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement  of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit  for the period in which the transaction is settled.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 50 | Standalone financial statements 1.13  F orward and options contracts in foreign  currencies The Company uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The use  of these foreign exchange forward and options contracts reduce the  risk or cost to the Company , and the Company does not use those for  trading or speculation purposes.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Company adopted AS 30, ‘Financial  Instruments : Recognition and Measur ement’, to the extent that the  adoption did not conflict with existing accounting standards and  other authoritative pronouncements of the Company Law and other  regulatory requirements.
Forward and options contracts are fair valued at each reporting date.
The resultant gain or loss from these transactions are recognized in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Company records the gain or  loss on effective hedges, if any , in the foreign currency fluctuation  reserve until the transactions are complete.
On completion, the gain  or loss is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss of that period.
To designate a forward or options contract as an effective hedge, the  Management objectively evaluates and evidences with appropriate  supporting documents at the inception of each contract whether the  contract is effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to  the hedged risk.
In the absence of a designation as effective hedge, a  gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Currently  hedges undertaken by the Company are all ineffective in nature and  the resultant gain or loss consequent to fair valuation is recognized in  the Statement of Profit and Loss at each reporting date.
1.14 I ncome taxes Income taxes are accrued in the same period that the related revenue  and expenses arise.
A provision is made for income tax annually , based  on the tax liability computed, after considering tax allowances and  exemptions.
Provisions are recorded when it is estimated that a liability  due to disallowances or other matters is probable.
Minimum Alternate  Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise  to future economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future  income tax liability , is recognized as an asset in the Balance Sheet if  there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal tax  after the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured  reliably .
The Company offsets, on a year on year basis, the current tax  assets and liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right and where  it intends to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified, and  thereafter a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets in situation where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exists, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income  will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in situation of unabsorbed depreciation  and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if there is  reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax assets are  reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying values  at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  have been offset wherever the Company has a legally enforceable  right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to  income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .
Tax benefits of  deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of  compensation charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss are credited  to the share premium account.
1.15 Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the  period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit  after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares considered  for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted average  number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential equity shares  are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually  issued at fair value which is the average market value of the outstanding  shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the  beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
Dilutive potential  equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are  adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits  and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the  approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.
1.16 I nvestments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance the  Company's business interests.
Investments are either classified as  current or long‑term based on the Management's intention.
Current  investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of each  investment individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises  the Indian rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long‑term investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to  recognize any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of  each investment.
1.17 C ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash on deposit with  banks and corporations.
The Company considers all highly liquid  investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three  months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of  cash to be cash equivalents.
1.18 C ash Flow Statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit  before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non‑cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.
1.19 L eases Lease under which the Company assumes substantially all the risks  and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight line basis in the Statement of Profit and Loss  over the lease term.

These income tax demands are mainly on account of disallowance of a portion  of the deduction claimed by the Company under Section 10A of the Income Tax Act.
The deductible amount is determined by the ratio of export turnover to total turnover .
The disallowance  arose from certain expenses incurred in foreign currency being reduced from export turnover but not reduced from total turnover .
The tax demand for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 also  includes disallowance of portion of profit earned outside India from the STP units and disallowance of profits earned from SEZ units.
The matter for fiscal years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009  are pending before the Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals), Bangalore.
The company is contesting the demand and the Management including its tax advisors believes that its position will  likely be upheld in the appellate process.
The Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position  and results of operations.

2.28 S egment reporting The Company's operations predominantly relate to providing  end‑to‑end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business  performance.
Effective quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Company  reorganized its business to strengthen its focus on growing existing  client relationships and increasing market share through service  differentiation and operational agility .
Consequent to the internal  reorganization there were changes effected in the reportable industry  segments based on the ‘management approach’ as laid down in AS 17,  Segment reporting and an additional segment, Life Sciences and  Healthcare was identified.
The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the  Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis  of various performance indicators by industry classes and geographic  segmentation of customers.
Accordingly , segment information has been  presented both along industry classes and geographic segmentation  of customers, industry being the primary segment.
The accounting  principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are  consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual  segments, and are as set out in the significant accounting policies.
Industry segments for the Company are primarily enterprises in  Financial Services and Insurance (FSI), enterprises in Manufacturing  (MFG), enterprises in the Energy and utilities, Communication and  Services (ECS) and enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods  and Logistics (RCL), enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare  (LSH).
Geographic segmentation is based on business sourced from  that geographic region and delivered from both on‑site and off‑shore.
North America comprises the United States of America, Canada and  Mexico; Europe includes continental Europe (both the east and the  west), Ireland and the United Kingdom; and the Rest of the World  comprising all other places except those mentioned above and India.
Consequent to the above change in the composition of reportable  industry segments, the prior year comparatives have been restated.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company's offshore software  development centers and on‑site expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the  underlying assets are used interchangeably .
Management believes that  it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs  and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed  as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of the Company .
Fixed assets used in the Company's business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.
Accordingly , no disclosure relating to total segment assets and liabilities  are made.
Geographical information on revenue and industry revenue  information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in  relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

This has been offset pursuant  to transfer of all assets and liabilities of ICIL on account of merger.
As at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, the plan assets have been  primarily invested in government securities.
The estimates of future  salary increases, considered in actuarial valuation, take account of  inflation, seniority , promotion and other relevant factors such as supply  and demand factors in the employment market.
The Company expects  to contribute ` 110 cr ore to the gratuity trust during the fiscal year 2015.
Effective July 1, 2007, the Company revised the employee death benefits  provided under the gratuity plan, and included all eligible employees  under a consolidated term insurance cover.
Accordingly , the obligations  under the gratuity plan reduced by ` 37 cr ore, which is being amortized  on a straight line basis to the Statement of Profit and Loss over 10 years  representing the average future service period of the employees.
The  unamortized liability as at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 amounts  to ` 11 cr ore and ` 15 cr ore, respectively and disclosed under ‘Other  long‑term liabilities’ and ‘other current liabilities’.
The Company has aligned the gratuity entitlement for majority of  its employees prospectively to the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
This amendment has resulted in a curtailment gain of ` 69 cr ore for  the year ended March 31, 2013 which has been recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2013.
2.30 P rovident fund The Company contributed ` 262 cr ore towards provident fund during  the year ended March 31, 2014 ( ` 240 cr ore during the year ended  March 31, 2013).
The Guidance on Implementing AS 15, Employee Benefits (revised  2005) issued by Accounting Standards Board (ASB) states that benefits  involving employer established provident funds, which require interest  shortfalls to be recompensed are to be considered as defined benefit  plans.
The Actuarial Society of India has issued the final guidance for  measurement of provident fund liabilities during the quarter ended  December 31, 2011.
The actuary has accordingly provided a valuation  and based on the below provided assumptions there is no shortfall as  at March 31, 2014, March 31, 2013, March 31, 2012, March 31, 2011  and March 31, 2010.

Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 66 | Standalone financial statements In addition, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’)  reviewed the Company's employer eligibility verifications on Form  I‑9 with respect to its employees working in the United States.
In connection with this review, the Company was advised that the  DHS has found errors in a significant percentage of its Forms I‑9 that  the DHS has reviewed, and may impose fines and penalties on the  Company related to such alleged errors.
On October 30, 2013, the Company settled the foregoing matters  and entered into a Settlement Agreement (‘Settlement Agreement’)  with the U.S. Attorney , the DHS and the United States Department  of State (‘State’, and collectively with the U.S. Attorney and the DHS,  the ‘United States’).
In the Settlement Agreement, the Company denied and disputed all  allegations made by the United States, except for the allegation that the  Company failed to maintain accurate Forms I‑9 records for many of its  foreign nationals in the United States in 2010 and 2011 as required by  law, and that such failure constituted civil violations of certain laws.
Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed, among other  things, that : •	The company will pay to the United States an aggregate amount  equal to ` 213 crore;  •	The Company will retain, for a period of two years from the date of  the Settlement Agreement, an independent third‑party auditor or  auditing firm at its expense which will annually review and report  on its Forms I‑9 compliance, which reports shall be submitted to  the U.S. Attorney; and  •	Within 60 days after the first anniversary of the Settlement  Agreement, the Company will furnish a report to the U.S. Attorney  concerning the Company's compliance with its internal B‑1 visa use  policies, standards of conduct, internal controls and disciplinary  procedures.
In return, the United States agreed, among other things, that : •	The United States will file a motion to dismiss with prejudice the  complaint it will file in the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Texas relating to allegations made by the United  States regarding the Company's compliance with laws regulating  H1‑B and B‑1 visas and Forms I‑9 (the ‘Alleged Conduct’); •	The United States will not use the Alleged Conduct to revoke any  existing visas or petitions or deny future visas or petitions for the  Company's foreign nationals, and will evaluate each visa or petition  on its own individual merits; •	The United States will not use the Alleged Conduct to debar or  suspend the Company from any B‑1 or H1‑B immigration program,  and the United States will not make any referrals to any government  agencies for such debarment or suspension proceedings related to  the Alleged Conduct; and  •	The United States will release the Company and each of its current  and former employees, directors, officers, agents and contractors  from any civil, administrative or criminal claims the United States  has or may have arising out of or pertaining to the Alleged Conduct,  subject to certain exceptions specified in the Settlement Agreement.
Further, separate from, but related to the Settlement Agreement, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement has confirmed that it will not  impose debarment from any B‑1 or H1‑B immigration program on the  Company related to the Alleged Conduct.
The Company recorded a charge related to the Settlement Agreement  including legal costs of ` 219 cr ore in the year ended March  31,  2014 related to the matters that were the subject of the Settlement  Agreement.

Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated  financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Company in accordance with accounting principles  generally accepted in India.
This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation  and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical  requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from  material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the  Company's preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the consolidated financial statements give a true  and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India : (i) in the case of the consolidated Balance Sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2014; (ii) in the case of the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss account, of the profit for the year ended on that date; and (iii) in the case of the consolidated Cash Flow statement, of the cash flows for the year ended on that date.

The group of companies (‘the Group’)  provides business consulting, technology , engineering and outsourcing  services to help clients build tomorrow's enterprise.
In addition, the  Group offers software products and platforms.
1 Sig nificant accounting policies 1.1 Basis of pr eparation of financial statements These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain financial  instruments which are measured at fair values.
GAAP comprises  mandatory accounting standards as prescribed by the Companies  (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006, the provisions of the Companies  Act, 2013 (to the extent notified) and the Companies Act, 1956  (to the extent applicable) and guidelines issued by the Securities  and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
Accounting policies have been  consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard  is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard  requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the principles  and procedures required for the preparation and presentation of  consolidated financial statements as laid down under the Accounting  Standard (AS) 21, ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
The financial  statements of Infosys — the parent company , Infosys BPO and its  wholly-owned subsidiaries, Infosys China, Infosys Australia, Infosys  Mexico, Infosys Consulting India, Infosys Sweden, Infosys Brasil,  Infosys Public Services, Infosys Americas, Edgeverve, Infosys Shanghai,  Infosys Lodestone and its controlled subsidiaries and controlled trusts  have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together book  values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after  eliminating intra-group balances and transactions and resulting  unrealized gain / loss.
The consolidated financial statements are  prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group.
Minority interests have been excluded.
Minority interests represent  that part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that  are not, directly or indirectly , owned or controlled by the Company .
1.2 U se of estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP  requires the Management to make estimates and assumptions that  affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities and disclosures  relating to contingent liabilities as at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the  period.
Examples of such estimates include computation of percentage  of completion which requires the Group to estimate the efforts or  costs expended to date as a proportion of the total efforts or costs to  be expended, provisions for doubtful debts, future obligations under  employee retirement benefit plans, income taxes, post-sales customer  support and the useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual  results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate changes in  estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes  in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in  which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in  the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1.3 R evenue recognition Revenue is primarily derived from software development and related  services and from the licensing of software products.
Arrangements  with customers for software development and related services are either  on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as the related  services are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing to  the Balance Sheet date is recognized as unbilled revenues.
Revenue  from fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, where there is no  uncertainty as to measurement or collectability of consideration, is  recognized based upon the percentage of completion method.
When  there is uncertainty as to measurement or ultimate collectability ,  revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Cost and earnings in excess of billings are classified as unbilled revenue  while billings in excess of cost and earnings is classified as unearned  revenue.
Provision for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become  probable based on the current estimates.
Annual Technical Services revenue and revenue from fixed-price  maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period in  which services are rendered.
Revenue from the sale of user licenses for  software applications is recognized on transfer of the title in the user  license, except in case of multiple element contracts, which require  significant implementation services, where revenue for the entire  arrangement is recognized over the implementation period based upon  the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software products  is recognized as the related services are performed.
The Group accounts for volume discounts and pricing incentives to  customers as a reduction of revenue based on the ratable allocation  of the discount / incentive amount to each of the underlying revenue  transactions that result in progress by the customer towards earning  the discount / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Group recognizes the  liability based on its estimate of the customer's future purchases.
If it  is probable that the criteria for the discount will not be met, or if  the amount thereof cannot be estimated reliably , then the discount  is not recognized until the payment is probable and the amount can  be estimated reliably .
The Group recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts using a cumulative catch-up  approach.
The discounts are passed on to the customer either as direct  payments or as a reduction of payments due from the customer.
The Group presents revenues net of value-added taxes in its  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Profit on sale of investments is recorded on transfer of title from the  Group and is determined as the difference between the sale price and  carrying value of the investment.
Lease rentals are recognized ratably  on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest is recognized using  the time-proportion method, based on rates implicit in the transaction.
Dividend income is recognized when the Group's right to receive  dividend is established.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 72 | Consolidated financial statements 1.4 P rovisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group  has a present legal obligation that can be estimated reliably , and it is  probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle  the obligation.
Provisions are determined by the best estimate of the  outflow of economic benefits required to settle the obligation at the  reporting date.
Where no reliable estimate can be made, a disclosure  is made as contingent liability .
A disclosure for a contingent liability is  also made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation  that may , but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.
Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect  of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision  or disclosure is made.
1.5 P ost-sales client support and warranties The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period warranty for  corrections of errors and telephone support on all its fixed-price,  fixed-t imeframe contracts.
Costs associated with such support  services are accrued at the time when related revenues are recorded  and included in cost of sales.
The Group estimates such costs based  on historical experience, and the estimates are reviewed annually for  any material changes in assumptions.
1.6 Oner ous contracts Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected  benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the  unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at lower of the expected cost of terminating  the contract and the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract.
1.7 T angible assets, intangible assets, including  goodwill and capital work-in-progress Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and  impairment, if any .
Direct costs are capitalized until fixed assets are  ready for use.
Capital work-in-progress comprises the cost of fixed  assets that are not yet ready for their intended use at the reporting date.
Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition  of such assets and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and  impairment.
Goodwill comprises the excess of purchase consideration  over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired enterprise.
Goodwill  arising on consolidation or acquisition is not amortized but is tested  for impairment.
1.8 D epreciation and amortization Depreciation on fixed assets is provided on the straight-line method over  the useful lives of assets estimated by the Management.
Depreciation  for assets purchased / sold during a period is proportionately charged.
Individual low cost assets (acquired for ` 5 ,000 or less) are depreciated  over a period of one year from the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets  are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on  a straight-line basis, commencing from the date the asset is available  to the Group for its use.
Leasehold improvements are written off over  the lower of the remaining primary period of lease or the life of the  asset.
The Management estimates the useful lives for the other fixed  assets as follows : Buildings 15 years Plant and machinery 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment 2 – 5 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation and amortization methods, useful lives and residual  values are reviewed at each reporting date.
1.9 Impairment The Management periodically assesses using, external and internal  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying value of an  asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is  higher of the asset's net selling price and value in use, which means  the present value of future cash flows is expected to arise from the  continuing use of the asset and its eventual disposal.
An impairment  loss for an asset other than goodwill is reversed if, and only if, the  reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the  impairment loss was recognized.
The carrying amount of an asset  other than goodwill is increased to its revised recoverable amount,  provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that  would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization  or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset  in prior years.
1.10  R etirement benefits to employees Gratuity In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, Infosys  provides for gratuity , a defined benefit retirement plan (‘the Gratuity  Plan’) covering eligible employees of the Company and Infosys BPO.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees  at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of  an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure  of employment with the Group.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by  actuarial valuation at each Balance Sheet date using the projected  unit credit method.
The Company fully contributes all ascertained  liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust  (the Trust).
In case of Infosys BPO, contributions are made to the  Infosys BPO's Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust.
Trustees administer  contributions made to the Trust and contributions are invested in  specific investments as permitted by the law.
The Group recognizes  the net obligation of the gratuity plan in the Balance Sheet as an asset  or liability , respectively in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS)  15, ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Group's overall expected long-term  rate-of-return on assets has been determined based on consideration  of available market information, current provisions of Indian law  specifying the instruments in which investments can be made, and  historical returns.
The discount rate is based on the Government  securities yield.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience  adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  they arise.
Superannuation Certain employees of Infosys are also participants in a defined  contribution plan.
The company has no further obligations to the  Plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Certain employees of Infosys  BPO are also eligible for superannuation benefit.
Infosys BPO has no  further obligations to the superannuation plan beyond its monthly  contribution which is periodically contributed to a trust fund,  the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation  of India (LIC).
Provident fund Eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is  a defined benefit plan.
Both the employee and the Company make  monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified  percentage of the covered employee's salary .
The Company contributes  a part of the contributions to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident  Fund Trust.
The trust invests in specific designated instruments as  permitted by Indian law.
The remaining portion is contributed to the  government-administered pension fund.
The rate at which the annual  interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Consolidated financial statements | 73  by the government.
The Company has an obligation to make good the  shortfall, if any , between the return from the investments of the trust  and the notified interest rate.
In respect of Infosys BPO, eligible employees receive benefits from  a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan.
Both the  employee and Infosys BPO make monthly contributions to this  provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered  employee's salary .
Amounts collected under the provident fund plan  are deposited in a government-administered provident fund.
Infosys  BPO has no further obligations under the provident fund plan beyond  its monthly contributions.
Compensated absences The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated absences which  are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature.
The expected  cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial  valuation based on the additional amount expected to be paid as a  result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance  Sheet date.
Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is  recognized in the period in which the absences occur.
1.11 R esearch and development Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product development  costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial  feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits  are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and  use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably .
1.12 F oreign currency transactions Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are translated at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date.
The  gains or losses resulting from such translations are included  in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Non-monetary assets and non- monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured  at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date  when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary assets and non- monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured  at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the  date of transaction.
Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign  currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the date  of the transaction.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement  of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit  for the period in which the transaction is settled.
The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries  from the local currency to the reporting currency of the Company is  performed for Balance Sheet accounts using the exchange rate in effect  at the Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items  using a monthly average exchange rate for the respective periods and  the resulting difference is presented as foreign currency translation  reserve included in ‘Reserves and Surplus’.
When a subsidiary is  disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount is transferred to  profit or loss.
1.13 F orward and options contracts in foreign currencies The Group uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The use  of these foreign exchange forward and options contracts reduce the  risk or cost to the Group and the Group does not use those for trading  or speculation purposes.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Group adopted AS 30, ‘Financial  Instruments : Recognition and Measur ement’, to the extent that the  adoption did not conflict with existing accounting standards and  other authoritative pronouncements of the Company Law and other  regulatory requirements.
Forward and options contracts are fair valued at each reporting date.
The resultant gain or loss from these transactions are recognized in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group records the gain  or loss on effective hedges, if any , in the foreign currency fluctuation  reserve until the transactions are complete.
On completion, the gain  or loss is transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss of that period.
To designate a forward or options contract as an  effective hedge, the Management objectively evaluates and evidences  with appropriate supporting documents at the inception of each  contract whether the contract is effective in achieving offsetting cash  flows attributable to the hedged risk.
In the absence of a designation  as effective hedge, a gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Currently , hedges undertaken by the  Group are all ineffective in nature and the resultant gain or loss  consequent to fair valuation is recognized in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss at each reporting date.
1.14 I ncome taxes Income taxes are accrued in the same period that the related revenue  and expenses arise.
A provision is made for income tax annually , based  on the tax liability computed, after considering tax allowances and  exemptions.
Provisions are recorded when it is estimated that a liability  due to disallowances or other matters is probable.
Minimum alternate  tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws, which gives rise to  future economic benefits in the form of tax credit against future income  tax liability , is recognized as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet  if there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal tax after  the tax holiday period and the resultant asset can be measured reliably .
The Group offsets, on a year-on-year basis, the current tax assets and  liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right and where it intends  to settle such assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The differences that result between the profit considered for income  taxes and the profit as per the financial statements are identified, and  thereafter a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded  for timing differences, namely the differences that originate in one  accounting period and reverse in another, based on the tax effect of the  aggregate amount of timing difference.
The tax effect is calculated on  the accumulated timing differences at the end of an accounting period  based on enacted or substantively enacted regulations.
Deferred tax  assets in a situation where unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward  business loss exists, are recognized only if there is virtual certainty  supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable  income will be available against which such deferred tax asset can be  realized.
Deferred tax assets, other than in a situation of unabsorbed  depreciation and carry forward business loss, are recognized only if  there is reasonable certainty that they will be realized.
Deferred tax  assets are reviewed for the appropriateness of their respective carrying  values at each reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities have been offset wherever the Group has a legally enforceable  right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and  where the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to  income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .
Tax benefits of  deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of  compensation charged to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  are credited to the share premium account.
1.15 Ear nings per share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during  the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the  net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares  considered for deriving basic earnings per share and also the weighted  average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon  conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The diluted potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares  been actually issued at fair value which is the average market value of  the outstanding shares.
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 74 | Consolidated financial statements converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later  date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are  adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits  and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the  approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of  Directors.
1.16 I nvestments Trade investments are the investments made to enhance the Group's  business interests.
Investments are either classified as current or  long-term based on the Management's intention at the time of purchase.
Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value of  each investment individually .
Cost for overseas investments comprises  the Indian Rupee value of the consideration paid for the investment  translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of investment.
Long-term investments are carried at cost less provisions recorded to  recognize any decline, other than temporary , in the carrying value of  each investment.
1.17 C ash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash on deposit with  banks and corporations.
The Group considers all highly liquid  investments with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three  months or less and that are readily convertible to known amounts of  cash to be cash equivalents.
1.18 C ash Flow Statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit  before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash  receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with  investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating,  investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated.
1.19 L eases Lease under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and  rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Such assets  acquired are capitalized at fair value of the asset or present value of  the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever  is lower.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as an  expense on a straight-line basis in the Consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss over the lease term.
1.20 G overnment grants The Group recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable  assurance that the conditions attached to them shall be complied  with, and the grants will be received.
Government grants related to  depreciable assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized  in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and  rational basis over the useful life of the asset.
Government grants related  to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them  with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

pertaining to earlier periods.
Income taxes The provision for taxation includes tax liabilities in India on the Company's  global income as reduced by exempt incomes and any tax liabilities arising  overseas on income sourced from those countries.
Infosys' operations  are conducted through Software Technology Parks (STPs) and Special  Economic Zones (SEZs).
Income from STPs were tax exempt for the earlier  of 10 years commencing from the fiscal year in which the unit commences  software development, or March 31, 2011.
Income from SEZs is fully tax  exempt for the first five years, 50% exempt for the next five years and  50% exempt for another five years subject to fulfilling certain conditions.

These income tax demands are mainly on account of disallowance  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Consolidated financial statements | 83  of a portion of the deduction claimed by the Company under Section 10A of the Income Tax Act.
The deductible amount is determined by the ratio of export turnover to total turnover .
The disallowance arose from certain expenses incurred in foreign currency being reduced from export turnover but not reduced from total turnover .
The tax demand for fiscal years 2007,  2008 and 2009 also includes disallowance of portion of profit earned outside India from the STP units and disallowance of profits earned from SEZ units.
The matter for fiscal years 2006,  2007, 2008 and 2009 are pending before the Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals), Bangalore.
The company is contesting the demand and the Management including its tax advisors  believes that its position will likely be upheld in the appellate process.
The Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on  the Company's financial position and results of operations.
As of the Balance Sheet date, the Group's net foreign currency  exposures that are not hedged by a derivative instrument or otherwise  is ` 539 cr ore ( ` 1,206 cr ore as at March 31, 2013).

2.22 S egment reporting The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end  business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance.
Effective quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Group reorganized its  business to strengthen its focus on growing existing client relationships  and increasing market share through service differentiation and  operational agility .
Consequent to the internal reorganization there  were changes effected in the reportable industry segments based on the  ‘management approach’ as laid down in AS 17, Segment reporting and  an additional segment, Life Sciences and Healthcare was identified.
The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD) evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based  on an analysis of various performance indicators by industry classes  and geographic segmentation of customers.
Accordingly , segment  information has been presented both along industry classes and  geographic segmentation of customers, industry being the primary  segment.
The accounting principles used in the preparation of the  financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and  expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the significant  accounting policies.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Consolidated financial statements | 85  Industry segments for the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial  Services and Insurance (FSI), enterprises in Manufacturing (MFG),  enterprises in the Energy and utilities, Communication and Services  (ECS), enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods and Logistics  (RCL), enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare (LSH).
Geographic  segmentation is based on business sourced from that geographic  region and delivered from both on site and off shore.
North America  comprises the United States of America, Canada and Mexico, Europe  includes continental Europe (both the east and the west), Ireland and  the United Kingdom, and the Rest of the World comprising all other  places except those mentioned above and India.
Consequent to the  above change in the composition of reportable industry segments, the  prior year comparatives have been restated.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments  are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to  that segment.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company's offshore software  development centers and onsite expenses, which are categorized in  relation to the associated turnover of the segment.
Certain expenses  such as depreciation, which form a significant component of total  expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the  underlying assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes  that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those  costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately  disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the total income of  the Group.
Fixed assets used in the Group's business or liabilities contracted  have not been identified to any of the reportable segments, as the  fixed assets and services are used interchangeably between segments.

This has been offset pursuant  to transfer of all assets and liabilities of ICIL on account of merger.
As at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, the plan assets have been  primarily invested in government securities.
The estimates of future  salary increases, considered in actuarial valuation, take account of  inflation, seniority , promotion and other relevant factors such as  supply and demand factors in the employment market.
The Group  expects to contribute approximately ` 110 cr ore to the gratuity trust  during fiscal year 2015.
Effective July 1, 2007, the Company revised the employee death  benefits provided under the gratuity plan, and included all eligible  employees under a consolidated term insurance cover.
Accordingly ,  the obligations under the gratuity plan reduced by ` 37 cr ore, which  is being amortized on a straight-line basis to the Statement of Profit  and Loss over 10 years representing the average future service period  of the employees.
The unamortized liability as at March 31, 2014 and  March 31, 2013 amounted to ` 11 cr ore and ` 15 cr ore, respectively  and disclosed under ‘Other long-term liabilities’ and ‘Other current  liabilities’.
The Company has aligned the gratuity entitlement of certain employees  prospectively to the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
This amendment  has resulted in a curtailment gain of ` 6 9 crore which has been  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended  March 31, 2013.

2.29 Litiga tion On May 23, 2011, the Company received a subpoena from a grand  jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
The subpoena required that the Company provide to the grand jury  certain documents and records related to its sponsorships for, and  uses of, B1 business visas.
The Company complied with the subpoena.
In connection with the subpoena, during a meeting with the United  States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas, the Company  was advised that it and certain of its employees are targets of the grand  jury investigation.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) has  reviewed the Company's employer eligibility verifications on Form I-9  with respect to its employees working in the U.S.
In connection with  this review, the Company was advised that the DHS has found errors  in a significant percentage of its Forms I-9 that the DHS has reviewed,  and may impose fines and penalties on the Company related to such  alleged errors.
On October 30, 2013, the Company settled the foregoing matters  and entered into a Settlement Agreement (‘Settlement Agreement’)  with the U.S. Attorney , the DHS and the United States Department  of State (‘State,’ and collectively with the U.S. Attorney and the DHS,  the ‘United States’).
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 88 | Consolidated financial statements In the Settlement Agreement, the Company denied and disputed all  allegations made by the United States, except for the allegation that the  Company failed to maintain accurate Forms I-9 records for many of its  foreign nationals in the United States in 2010 and 2011 as required by  law, and that such failure constituted civil violations of certain laws.
Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed, among other  things, that : •	the Company will pay to the United States an aggregate amount  equal to ` 213 crore;  •	the Company will retain, for a period of two years from the date of  the Settlement Agreement, an independent third-party auditor or  auditing firm at its expense which will annually review and report  on its Forms I-9 compliance, these reports shall be submitted to  the U.S. Attorney; and •	within 60 days after the first anniversary of the Settlement  Agreement, the Company will furnish a report to the U.S. Attorney  concerning the Company's compliance with its internal B-1 visa use  policies, standards of conduct, internal controls and disciplinary  procedures.
In return, the United States agreed, among other things, that : •	the United States will file a motion to dismiss with prejudice the  complaint it will file in the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Texas relating to allegations made by the United  States regarding the Company's compliance with laws regulating  H1-B and B-1 visas and Forms I-9 (the ‘Alleged Conduct’); •	the United States will not use the Alleged Conduct to revoke any  existing visas or petitions or deny future visas or petitions for the  Company's foreign nationals, and will evaluate each visa or petition  on its own individual merits; •	the United States will not use the Alleged Conduct to debar or  suspend the Company from any B-1 or H1-B immigration program,  and the United States will not make any referrals to any government  agencies for such debarment or suspension proceedings related to  the Alleged Conduct; and •	the United States will release the Company and each of its current  and former employees, directors, officers, agents and contractors  from any civil, administrative or criminal claims the United States  has or may have arising out of or pertaining to the Alleged Conduct,  subject to certain exceptions specified in the Settlement Agreement.
Further, separate from, but related to the Settlement Agreement, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement has confirmed that it will not  impose debarment from any B-1 or H1-B immigration program on the  Company related to the Alleged Conduct.
The Company recorded a charge related to the Settlement Agreement  including legal costs of ` 219 cr ore in the year ended March 31, 2014  related to the matters that were the subject of the Settlement Agreement.
The said amount has been paid prior to December 31, 2013.
In addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims,  which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.
The Company's  management does not reasonably expect that these legal actions, when  ultimately concluded and determined, will have a material and adverse  effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

Chief Risk Officer and  Company Secretary Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Consolidated financial statements | 89  Our corporate governance philosophy Corporate governance is an ethically driven business process that is  committed to values aimed at enhancing an organization's wealth  generating capacity .
This is ensured by taking ethical business  decisions and conducting business with a firm commitment to values,  while meeting stakeholders' expectations.
At Infosys, it is imperative  that our company affairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner.
This is vital to gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders.
Our corporate governance framework ensures effective engagement  with our stakeholders and helps us evolve with changing times.
The  publication of the Cadbury Report in the U.K. in 1992 was  a significant event in modern corporate governance.
The report  recommended the arrangement of company boards and accounting  systems to reduce corporate governance risks and failures.
The enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, resulted in the senior  management individually certifying the accuracy of their company's  financial information.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act looks to build a safer, more stable financial  system to set the foundation for sound economic growth and job safety .
Recently , the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) sought to  amend the equity listing agreement to bring in additional corporate  governance norms for listed entities.
These norms provide for stricter  disclosures and protection of investor rights, including equitable  treatment for minority and foreign shareholders.
Many of the amendments are effective from October 1, 2014.
The amended rules require companies to get shareholders' approval  for related party transactions, establish whistleblower mechanisms,  elaborate disclosures on pay packages and have at least one woman  director on their boards.
The amended norms are aligned with the provisions of the Companies  Act, 2013, and is aimed to encourage companies to ‘adopt best  practices on corporate governance’.
We believe that an active, well-informed and independent board is  necessary to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.
It is  well-recognized that an effective Board is a pre-requisite for a strong  and effective corporate governance.
At Infosys, the Board of Directors  (‘the Board’) is at the core of our corporate governance practice and  oversees how the Management serves and protects the long-term  interests of our stakeholders.
Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make timely  disclosures and share accurate information regarding our financials  and performance, as well as the leadership and governance of the  Company .
Our corporate governance philosophy is based on the following  principles : •	Corporate governance standards should go beyond the law and  satisfy the spirit of the law, not just the letter of the law •	When in doubt, disclose.
Ensure transparency and maintain a high  level of disclosure •	Clearly distinguish between personal conveniences and corporate  resources •	Communicate externally , and truthfully , about how the Company  is run internally •	Comply with the laws of all countries in which we operate •	Have a simple and transparent corporate structure driven solely by  business needs •	The Management is the trustee of the shareholders' capital and not  the owner We firmly believe that Board independence is essential to bring  objectivity and transparency in the Management and in the  dealings of the Company .
As on March 31, 2014, the majority of  our Board members – seven out of 13 – are independent members.
An independent director is nominated as the chairperson of each of  the audit, management development and compensation, stakeholders  relationship, nominations and governance, risk management and  corporate social responsibility committees.
As part of our commitment to follow global best practices, we  substantially comply with the Euroshareholders Corporate Governance  Guidelines 2000 and the recommendations of the Conference Board  Commission on Public Trusts and Private Enterprises in the U.S.  We  also adhere to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)  and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) principles.
Corporate governance ratings CRISIL For several years now, CRISIL has consistently assigned us the ‘CRISIL  Governance and Value Creation (GVC) Level 1’ rating.
This GVC rating  indicates our capability to create wealth for all our stakeholders while  adopting sound corporate governance practices.
ICRA ICRA assigned the ‘Corporate Governance Rating (CGR) 1’ rating to  our practices.
The rating is the highest on ICRA's scale of CGR 1 to  CGR 6.
We are the first company in India to be assigned the highest  CGR by ICRA.
The rating reflects our transparent shareholding pattern,  sound Board practices, interactive decision-making process, high level  of transparency , disclosures encompassing all important aspects of  our operations and our excellent track record in investor servicing.
ICRA has also appreciated our Board composition as reasonably sized,  cohesive and articulate.
The rating also implies that we follow practices  that provide our financial stakeholders the highest level of assurance  on the quality of corporate governance.
Corporate governance guidelines Over the years, the Board has developed corporate governance  guidelines to help fulfill our corporate responsibility towards our  stakeholders.
These guidelines ensure that the Board will have the  necessary authority and processes in place to review and evaluate our  operations when required.
Further, these guidelines allow the Board  to make decisions that are independent of the Management.
The Board  may change these guidelines regularly to achieve our stated objectives.
A.
B oard composition Size and composition of the Board The current policy is to have an appropriate mix of executive and  independent directors to maintain the independence of the Board,  and separate its functions of governance and management.

The responsibility and authority of these officials are as follows :  •	The Executive Chairman of the Board (the Chairman) is the leader  of the Board.
As Chairman, he will be responsible for fostering  and promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture  where the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit of  the Company and all its stakeholders.

In doing so, the Chairman will preside at meetings  of the Board and at meetings of the shareholders of the Company .
The Chairman will take a lead role in managing the Board and  facilitating communication among directors.
The Chairman will  be responsible for matters pertaining to governance, including  the organization and composition of the Board, the organization  and conduct of Board meetings, effectiveness of the Board,  Board committees and individual directors in fulfilling their  responsibilities.

The Listing Agreement  also states that the person should not have a material pecuniary  relationship or transactions with the company , which in the opinion  of the Board, would interfere in exercising independent judgment and  carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
The Companies Act, 2013, has also provided a definition of  independence.
Further, we are listed on NYSE in the U.S.
Hence, we  comply with the definition of independence as per the Clause 49 of  the Listing Agreement, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the  NYSE rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002.
Board membership criteria The nominations and governance committee works with the entire  Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experience  required for the Board as a whole and for individual members.
Board  members are expected to possess the expertise, skills and experience  required to manage and guide a high-growth, high-tech IT services  company , deriving revenue primarily from G-7 countries.
Expertise in  strategy , technology , finance, quality and human resources is essential.
Generally , the members are between 40 and 60 years of age, and are not  related to any executive directors or independent directors.
They are  not expected to serve in any executive or independent position in  any company that is in direct competition with us.
Board members  are expected to rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in all  Board and applicable committee meetings.
Each member is expected  to ensure that their other current and planned future commitments do  not materially interfere with their responsibilities with us.
Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Corporate governance report | 91  Selection of new directors The Board is responsible for the selection of new directors.
The Board  delegates the screening and selection process involved in selecting  new directors to the nominations and governance committee, which  consists exclusively of independent directors.
The nominations and  governance committee in turn makes recommendations to the Board  on the induction of any new directors.
Membership term The Board constantly evaluates the contribution of the members  and periodically shares updates with the shareholders about  re-a ppointments according to the existing statute.
The current law  in India mandates the retirement of two-third of the executive board  members (who are liable to retire by rotation) every year, and qualifies  the retiring members for re -appointment.
Executive directors are  appointed by the shareholders for the tenure of a maximum period of  five years, but are eligible for re-appointment upon completion of their  term.
Subject to the applicable provisions of law, our non-executive  directors generally serve for a period of nine years, or up to the age of  retirement, whichever is earlier.
Retirement policy For directors The age of retirement for all executive directors is 60 years.

Members of the Company , at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)  held on June 9, 2012, approved by way of a special resolution the  payment of remuneration in the form of commission to non-executive  directors, at a sum not exceeding 1% per annum of our net profits for  each year for a period of five years, from April 1, 2013 to March 31,  2018.
We have paid ` 8.05 crore (US $1,316,100) as commission to  our non-executive directors for the year ended March 31, 2014.
The aggregate amount was arrived at according to the following  criteria :  in ` crore in US $ Fixed Board fee 0.45 75,000  Board attendance fee (1) 0.15 25,000 Lead independent director fee 0.90 150,000 Chairperson – audit committee 0.18 30,000 Members – audit committee 0.12 20,000 Chairperson – other committees 0.12 20,000 Members – other committees 0.06 10,000 Travel fee (per meeting) (2) 0.06 10,000 Notes :  1 US $ = ` 59.92  (1) The Company nor mally has five regular Board meetings in a year .
Independent  directors are expected to attend four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.
(2) For dir ectors based overseas, travel fee shown is per Board meeting.
This is based  on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated  for independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.
The Board believes that the above commission structure is  commensurate with global best practices in terms of remunerating  non-executive / independent directors of a company of similar size,  and adequately compensates for the time and contribution made by  our non-executive / independent directors.
Memberships in other boards An executive director may , with the prior consent of the Chairman of  the Board, serve on the board of two other business entities, provided  that such business entities are not in direct competition with our  business operations.
Executive directors are also allowed to serve on  the boards of corporate or government bodies whose interests are  germane to the future of the IT and software business or the key  economic institutions of the nation, or whose prime objective is to  benefit society .
Independent directors are not expected to serve on the  boards of competing companies.
There are no other limitations except  those imposed by law and good corporate governance practices.

E. Shar eholders Disclosures regarding the appointment or re-appointment  of directors As per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, B. G. Srinivas and  S. Gopalakrishnan will retire in the ensuing AGM and being eligible,  seek re-appointment.
The Board recommends their re-appointment.
The Companies Act, 2013 provides for appointment of independent  directors.
Sub-section (10) of Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013  (effective April 1, 2014) provides that independent directors shall hold  office for a term of up to five consecutive years on the board of a  company; and shall be eligible for re-appointment on passing a special  resolution by the shareholders of the company .
Sub-section (11) states that no independent director shall be eligible  for more than two consecutive terms of five years.
Sub-section (13)  states that the provisions of retirement by rotation as defined in  sub-sections (6) and (7) of Section 152 of the Act shall not apply to  such independent directors.
Our non-executive (independent) directors (except for  Kiran Mazumdar - Shaw and Carol M. Browner) were appointed as  directors liable to retire by rotation under the provisions of the erstwhile  Companies Act, 1956.
The Board has been advised that non-executive  (independent) directors so appointed would continue to serve the term  that was ascertained at the time of appointment as per the resolution  pursuant to which they were appointed.
Therefore, it stands to reason  that only those non -executive (independent) directors who will  complete their present term, at the ensuing AGM of the Company in  June 2014, being eligible and seeking re-appointment, be considered  by the shareholders for re-appointment for a term of up to five  consecutive years.
Non-executive (independent) directors who do not complete their  term at the ensuing AGM, will continue to hold office till expiry  of their term (based on retirement period calculation) and would  thereafter be eligible for re-appointment for a fixed term in accordance  with the 2013 Act.
The detailed profiles of all these directors are provided in the Notice  convening the AGM.

They are also  introduced to our organization structure, our services, group structure  and subsidiaries, constitution, board procedures, matters reserved for  the Board, and our major risks and risk management strategy .
The Board's policy is to have separate meetings regularly with  independent directors to update them on all business-related issues  and new initiatives.
At such meetings, the executive directors and  other members of the senior management share points of view and  leadership thoughts on relevant issues.
We also facilitate the continual education requirements of our directors.

Each Board  member makes a presentation to the Board highlighting their  contributions and thought leadership initiatives pursued during the  year.
A scale of 1 to 3 is used by every Board member during the  evaluation of each of the external Board members.
Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and  guidance.
Some of the performance indicators based on which the  independent directors are evaluated include :  •	Ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance  practices •	Ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to  address top-management issues •	Active participation in long-term strategic planning •	Commitment to the fulfillment of a director's obligations and  fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in the Board  and committee meetings Whistleblower Policy In April 2014, the Board adopted the revised Whistleblower Policy  that adopts global best practices.

These guidelines provide Indian companies a framework  to govern themselves voluntarily according to the highest standards  of ethical and responsible conduct of business.
The Ministry hopes  Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Corporate governance report | 99  that the adoption of these guidelines will also translate into a much  higher level of stakeholders' confidence, which is crucial to ensure  the long-term sustainability of and value-generation by businesses.

Business and industry worldwide must continue  to drive sustainability , not just in their own operations  but also in their interactions with their communities.
In emerging economies, business and industry must set an  example in their home countries and their broader regions.” S. Gopalakrishnan Executive Vice Chairman Speaking on the occasion of his appointment as Chair of Business Action for Sustainable Development 2012 Introduction We have a defined approach towards responsible business, and this  guides our actions as a Company in fulfilling our responsibilities  towards our employees, external stakeholders and the community .
Besides  working within the industry to bring about systemic  changes regarding sustainability , our work in areas such as  education, health, sanitation and the environment is instrumental  in affirming our commitment to sustainable governance.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its circular  dated August 13, 2012, has mandated the inclusion of a Business  Responsibility Report (BRR) as a part of the Annual Report for top  100 listed entities.
We have been publishing our Business Responsibility Report  since  2012.
We are including this report in line with the  National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and  Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVG) as notified by  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India,  as  part of our Annual  Report.
We also publish a comprehensive  Sustainability Report annually , independently assured by Det  Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL), which follows the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 framework and is available  on our website, http://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings.
Business Responsibility Report Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 Being a value-driven company , we have always abided by the highest  levels of responsible business practices.
Our corporate governance  framework has set an industry benchmark, and continues to reflect  our commitment to ethical wealth generation keeping in mind  the interests of our investors as well as all the other stakeholders.
Our corporate governance practices adhere to the principles of fairness  and transparency .
These practices have often been ahead of compliance  requirements and prescribed voluntary disclosures.
Our core values,  captured by the term, C-LIFE, are as follows : •	Client value : To surpass client expectations consistently •	Leadership by example  : To set standards in our business and  transactions and be an exemplar for the industry and ourselves •	Integrity and transparency : To be ethical, sincere and open in all  our transactions •	Fairness : To be objective and transaction-oriented, and thereby earn  trust and respect •	Excellence : To strive relentlessly and constantly to improve ourselves,  our teams, our services and our products, to become the best Board members — seven out of 13 — are independent members.
An independent director is nominated as the chairperson of each of  the audit, management development and compensation, stakeholders  relationship, nominations and governance, risk management and  corporate social responsibility committees.
Enterprise risk management We have frameworks and processes that help us identify , assess, monitor  and mitigate risks in the long, medium and short terms.
Strong internal  audit processes have served us well.
The identification of focus areas  and articulated criteria for defining inherent vulnerabilities, and their  proactive management are part of the risk management framework.
Predictability , Sustainability , Profitability , and De-risking (PSPD) are  the four cornerstones of our de-risked business model.
Refer to the Risk Management Report for more details.
Corporate policies The Code of Conduct and Ethics helps us maintain the highest  standards of business conduct for our employees and comply with  legal requirements of all applicable laws and regulations including  anti-bribery , ethical handling of conflicts of interests, fair, accurate  and timely disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with  the required regulatory bodies.
This is communicated to employees  worldwide through training and awareness programs, both online and  instructor-led, using multiple learning interventions.
Every employee  compulsorily attends a session on values during his or her induction,  and acknowledges the Code of Conduct and Ethics through a sign-up  process.
A Whistleblower Policy , a Gift Policy , a strong grievance  redressal body , an uncompromising stand on value transgressions, and  supportive ecosystems ensure the availability of adequate mechanisms  to enable a culture of disclosure.
Sustainability focus Over the years, our leaders have been spearheading our sustainability  strategy to achieve a fine balance of economic, environmental and  social imperatives, while paying attention to the needs and expectations  of our internal as well as external stakeholders.
Our leaders have  been championing sustainability initiatives through global forums  and bodies.
This indicates the Management’s commitment to our  sustainability goals, which are embedded in our corporate scorecard.
We periodically communicate our progress on material aspects  concerning our stakeholders.
Regular discussions and reviews with  the Board and its committees, the senior management and other  stakeholders across the organization help us work consistently towards  fulfilling the expectations of our direct and indirect stakeholders.
Corporate social responsibility committee As per the Companies Act, 2013, all companies having net worth of  ` 500 cr ore or more, or turnover of ` 1,000 cr ore or more or a net  profit of ` 5 cr ore or more during any financial year will be required  to constitute a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee of  the Board of Directors consisting of three or more directors, at least  one of whom will be an independent director and have a CSR policy  approved by the Board.
Accordingly , the Board of Directors on April 15, 2014, constituted  the CSR Committee (‘the committee’) comprising K.  V .
Kamath,  Chairperson; R. Seshasayee, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and S. D. Shibulal.
The committee will formulate and monitor the CSR policy of the  Company .
It has adopted a policy that intends to (a) strive for economic  development that positively impacts the society at large with a minimal  resource footprint, and (b) embrace responsibility for the corporation's  actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the  environment, communities and stakeholders.
Commitment to responsible business The key dimensions of our corporate governance framework are as  follows : Transparency, fairness and accountability We have consistently followed the highest levels of disclosure with all  our stakeholders.
Besides ensuring compliance with the laws of the  land wherever we operate, we also have specific policies to ensure  transparency and accountability , such as the Code of Conduct and  Ethics and the Whistleblower Policy .
For several years now, CRISIL has  consistently assigned us the ‘CRISIL Governance and Value Creation  (GVC) Level 1’ rating.
ICRA has assigned the ‘Corporate Governance  Rating (CGR) 1’ rating to our practices.
We disclose financial  statements in accordance with the Indian GAAP and International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Board governance We believe that an active, diverse, well-informed and independent  board ensures the highest standards of corporate governance.

Solutions for societal well‑being We are investing in research on Internet of Things (IoT), along with  COMMIT, a public-private research community .
It aims to address the  challenges in information and communication science that is shaping  tomorrow’s society .
The work focuses on improving the health of  the sports community (including amateurs) by increasing personal  motivation of individuals, using behavioral intervention technology .
This  is based on modern Information and Communications  Technologies (ICT), especially smartphones, off-the-shelf sensors and  cloud.
The project combines three health aspects — physical, mental  and social, and their interactions.
It aims to provide real-time feedback  to users while exercising, using a smartphone with a complete  sense-model-action loop.
It gives personalized feedback, based on  individual goals and leverages aggregated information from groups of  users.
IoT will deliver scientific results in the detection of patterns in  exercise and health while providing intelligent motivational support.
The research currently focuses on improving health for the sports  community , but Infosys envisages its application across important  facets of well-being, these include : •	Assisted living for the elderly and remote monitoring •	Continuous monitoring of health and safety of field personnel  working in hazardous and remote environments like mines,  chemical plants, etc.
•	Regular monitoring of blood chemistry and vital signs of  post-operative and high-risk patients •	Emotion monitoring through stress levels and Facial Expression,  Awareness, Compassion, Emotions (FACE) Managing assets for environmental well‑being Infosys has numerous customer-loaned assets — over 70,000  equipment worth about ` 8,988 cr ore.
This accounts for a large  carbon footprint, high datacenter space requirements, high power  consumption, administrative bandwidth and substantial maintenance  and cooling costs.
On completion of the projects, a re-export of these  assets would mean high transportation costs and / or real-estate  expenditure for our clients.
A four-pronged innovative approach was  conceptualized to address these challenges : Build innovation platform  : A cost-effective, agile and robust IT  innovation platform was created that leverages technologies in  virtualization, optimization, storage and cloud-based technologies.
We were able to significantly reduce the total cost of ownership,  achieve desired business agility and reduce cycle time.
Optimized asset management : We focused on liaising with government  departments for policy changes and coordinated with internal units for  better resource management.
A cross-functional team was instituted to  track, monitor and review usage of loaned assets on a periodic basis.
This resulted in total energy savings of about 2,58,200 units, which  in turn provided cost savings to the tune of ` 2 cr ore.
The program  helped in optimum space utilization, saving about ` 9 cr ore, with a  potential annual saving of about ` 11 crore.
E-waste management : A lean process of loaned asset reconciliation and  optimization resulted in successful release of unused assets, gaining  forex credit of up to ` 8 cr ore. We were able to release around 81  tonnes of customer-loaned assets, reducing the carbon footprint by  2,421 tonnes, and the energy consumption by 2140 kW .
The initiative  created additional ‘useful’ real-estate and energy savings of ` 8 crore.
We were also able to streamline processes with customs / Software  Technology Parks of India on e-waste disposal for loaned equipment.
Server and storage virtualization  : We institutionalized an innovative  methodology to transform the physical IT infrastructure to Green IT  infrastructure by leveraging virtualization and blade server technology .
This helped preempt substantial investment and energy savings as  well as a significant reduction in carbon footprint.
The solution has  generated a cost saving of over ` 12 cr ore and has a saving potential  of over ` 2 cr ore. We have hosted close to 168 virtual machines,  which has taken care of critical project requirements, enabled R&D  and provided the infrastructure for training.
From an environmental  perspective, this has resulted in about 4,748 tonnes of carbon footprint  reduction, equivalent to planting 15,690 trees.
Extending goodwill to suppliers and partners Our responsibilities extend beyond our operational boundaries.
We  engage with suppliers / vendors and partners to advocate  responsible business practices.
The supply chain is more relevant  for our support processes than our core business.
Our vendor  empanelment guideline articulates our vendor selection criteria based  on cost, credibility , and capability .
We review our vendor management  practices regularly and sign the Master Service Agreements (MSA).
Our proportion of spending on domestic (India-based) suppliers was  about 86% for fiscal year 2014.
To strengthen responsible business practices in our supply chain, a  four- stage integrated framework called ‘VIVA — Visioning, Inculcating,  Valuing, Assessing’ was conceptualized in fiscal year 2013.
A Responsible  Supply Chain Policy that categorizes our suppliers into three broad  categories — people, services and products — was launched in 2013.
A Supplier Code of Conduct was administered to all key suppliers  in 2014.
We also revised our empanelment guidelines in 2014 and  strengthened our supplier assessment process.

Energy efficiency strategies Our energy consumption is mainly through the use of electricity and  high speed diesel used for generators and boilers.
Conservation of  electricity has been one of our focus areas and we have reduced our  per capita electricity consumption through some of our key strategies,  mentioned below.
These measures also help reduce the stress on the  regional grids for power availability to our local communities.
Central command center We have set up a central command center to monitor, manage and  optimize our electricity consumption, remotely .
We now have building  efficiency experts manage operations, provide remote technical  expertise for all locations, and analyze data to identify optimization  opportunities.
This centralized monitoring has helped us make  diagnostics smarter, and thus enhance operational effectiveness.
Environment Green buildings In fiscal year 2014, we were awarded the Leadership in Energy and  Environment Design (LEED) Platinum rating for five of our buildings  in Mysore, Mangalore, Pune and Hyderabad.
We now have 10 LEED  Platinum-rated buildings and two buildings with GRIHA 5-star rating,  making a total of about 3.4 million sq.
ft. with green certification —  the highest in India for office buildings.
Retrofits Our innovative approach to redesign and retrofit our air conditioning  systems has helped us achieve 10.1 MW reduction in connected load  in the last three years.
This has resulted in savings of nearly 174 million  units of electricity .
Most retrofits have a short payback time of about  three years and can be replicated easily in other commercial buildings.
For fiscal year 2014 alone, 2.9 MW connected load was reduced.
Adoption of renewable energy Our goal is to source 100% electricity from renewable sources by fiscal  year 2018.
We used 75.6 million units of electricity in fiscal year 2014.
We installed rooftop solar plants of 392 kW at our Hyderabad campus  and over 1,000 kW capacity in our Chennai campuses – 306 kW at  Sholinganallur and 765 kW at Mahindra City .
Energy-efficient IT infrastructure We have implemented significant measures to make our IT  infrastructure more energy efficient by adopting a multi-pronged  strategy as elaborated below : Virtualization and consolidation Continuing the adoption of the latest technology concepts such as  virtualization, consolidation, and cloud in order to reduce the physical  footprint of our servers, we have further expanded our internal private  cloud capacity , with MyCloud.
Used for software development and  testing purposes, MyCloud now has a capacity of around 8,500 virtual  machines.
Around 30% of instances provisioned on MyCloud this  year were addressed through virtual machines that were released, thus  facilitating better reuse.
We have continued to expand our Network-Attached Storage  (NAS)-based virtualization, this year.
We have virtualized 39% of  NAS filers, resulting in a reduction of 29% in the power demand of  NAS boxes.
In addition, we have deployed tools, which automatically  check and shutdown idle project-specific servers, yielding higher  power savings.
Central command center , Bangalore campus The LEED-rated Software Development Block-3 at the Mangalore campus Infosys Annual Report 2013-14 118 | Environment Data centers and server rooms We have standardized and incorporated eco-friendly designs for data  center and server rooms to ensure a reduction in power consumption.
We have revamped and released around 800 sq.
ft. of server room  or laboratory space this year.
Also, using hot-cold aisle separation,  and custom -made cages for the consolidation of racks, we have  optimized our air conditioning usage.
Recently , a Tier-3 datacenter  has been commissioned at our Australia campus, this data center has  attained a high standard of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.4  and can be partially powered by solar energy .
Rainwater can be used  in cooling towers, which has resulted in reducing in up to 25% of  power consumption.
Video / audio conferencing Our video and audio conferencing (VC and AC) usage has increased  steadily this year too, indirectly cutting down the travel requirements  of our employees.
We have doubled our VC capacity and have rolled  out a new plug-in for self-booking.
This has resulted in a sizable  increase in our VC usage by more than 100% compared to last year.
Our audio conference usage has increased by over 13% since last year.
Building strategic partnerships We continue to work with some of the most renowned research  institutes and adopt many global best practices to implement the latest  sustainable technologies at our new and existing buildings.
We have  strategic partnerships with the following organizations as on fiscal  year 2014 : •	Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for PACE-R,  a proposal for India-U.S. joint clean energy R&D.
•	Saint Gobain for research on building energy efficiency in hot and  humid climates.
•	United Technologies Research Group to develop solutions on fault  diagnostics and operational efficiency improvements in buildings.
•	Collaboration with World Business Council for Sustainable  Development (WBCSD) on energy efficiency in buildings.
Emissions Our emissions include greenhouse gases (GHG), SOx NOx and Ozone  Depleting Substances.
Other emissions from the stacks connected to  generators, boilers and diesel operated fire hydrant pumps are also  monitored on a monthly basis.
There have been no deviations from  the specified limits.
Our operations warrant the use of refrigerants in our Heating,  Ventilation and Air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which have varied  Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP).
We have made a conscious effort  to switch over to refrigerants with a zero ODP .
Our GHG emissions cover Scope 1 (fuel, hydrochloroflurocarbons  (HCFCs), SF6 and emissions from Company-owned vehicles), Scope 2  (electricity), Scope 3 (business travel, employee commute, waste and  LPG used in food courts).
The calculations done for GHG emissions  are based on the guidelines provided by — Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC), American Society of Heating, Refrigerating  and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards, the Central  Electricity Authority (CEA), Department for Environment, Food and  Rural Affairs (DEFRA), WBCSD and World Resources Institute (WRI).
Water efficiency As a responsible organization, we are committed to conserve water.
Water has become a scarce resource in our country .
We have taken  voluntary annual goals to reduce our fresh water consumption and  to harvest rainwater.
Rain water harvesting has helped replenish the  ground water tables in and around our campuses.
Waste management We have a focused approach towards waste management and establish  strategic annual targets to ensure environment friendly disposal of  waste in adherence to legislations, as applicable.
Our initiatives are  spread across three dimensions — influencing social behavior, process  optimization, and the implementation of technology .
We have set up  bio-gas and organic waste composting plants in some of our campuses  and are in the process of setting up similar plants at all our India  locations.
Biodiversity Our biodiversity policy is our commitment to conserve and promote  biodiversity across all our campuses.
We continue to organize tree  plantation drives with an emphasis on native and endangered species  on our campuses.
All our campuses in India are located on government-approved land  (industrial zones) and comply with the guidelines issued by the  Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, and do  not encroach on any protected or high-biodiversity regions.
Eco advocacy and eco group activities We advocate positive sustainability actions among our employees  to encourage good citizenship behavior.
We sponsor and support  employee-run volunteer eco groups, which take up projects that  address sustainable living, conservation of electricity and water,  recycling of waste, reducing carbon emissions, and afforestation.
These  groups also partner with local communities around our  campuses to work on various sustainability-related initiatives.
Compliance We did not have any monetary or non-monetary sanctions imposed  on us for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations  during fiscal year 2014.
