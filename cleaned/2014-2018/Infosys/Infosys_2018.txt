NAVIGATE YOUR NEXT TM Annual Report 2017-18  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Think back just one hundred years  from 2017 .
It would have taken you  anywhere between five and ten days  to get from London to New Y ork;  and well over a month to travel from  London to Australia.
Today, London  is only around eight hours away  from New Y ork and about a day from  Australia by air.
If you’d lived then,  it’s likely your home wouldn’t have  had a landline telephone, because  only 25% of working-class families  in the US did.
Today, landlines sit all  but forgotten in our living rooms.
Nearly 80% of the population, in the  US alone, has a smartphone in their  pockets, while you can call for free  over a WiFi network anywhere in the  world.
These are just two examples  of the hundreds of ways in which  someone, somewhere thought to  try something no one else had ever  dreamed of, chose to walk a path  untrodden, that then caught the  imagination of several others who  joined in, till the idea gathered the  strength to move us all forward.
The digital disruption that engulfs  us today has significantly increased  our collective ability to create the  next new normal.
At Infosys, we  see this as an exciting opportunity  to make a difference.
To partner with  our clients to look for the new things  their customers may not yet know  that they want, and help them be the  first to respond boldly to the calling.
To create their next.
We AI-power their core to help them  prioritize the execution of change  that’ll take them closer to emerging  opportunities.
Thereon, we help  them prepare to respond with Agile  Digital at scale.
We continuously  enrich them with skills and learning  from emerging technology domains  and industries outside their own,  so they can get the world’s best  ideas to work harder to delight their  customers.
Our digital framework  drives outcomes for them across  five areas – Experience, Insight,  Innovate, Accelerate and Assure.
We craft the way their customers  experience digital solutions, help  their businesses gain insight from  data, innovate with them in the world  of vertical platforms and digital-first  engineering, accelerate their core  digitalization, and assure means for  them to establish digital trust.
This annual report celebrates the  multiple facets of this journey.
A journey of so many nexts.
A journey that will get so much more  meaningful when you navigate your  next with Infosys.

Our clients  are beginning to  ponder over this  question more  deeply, more  frequently than ever before, and with  good reason.
They clearly see how  significantly customer experience can  differentiate their business.
Especially  with all that’s made possible by the  accelerated progression of digital  technology and its rapid uptake by  consumers.
They understand that  delivering great digital experiences  means taking all those steps  necessary to reimagine the business  – systems, processes, people – to  organize the enterprise from its very  core to deliver customer delight.
Over the past 12 months, we’ve  seen an increasing number of our  own clients fast-tracking their digital  transformation, to see the benefits of  being more customer-centric : more  satisfied buyers, increased loyalty,  vocal advocacy, and lower cost of  service, with us partnering them  through the journey.
What we did recently for a  technology conglomerate makes for  an interesting illustration.
We helped  them modernize, standardize, and  automate 20 of their key business  processes, and thereby digitize  more than a million caseloads, to  eliminate over 8 million hours of wait  time for their customers.
Before  we stepped in, something as vital  as their ‘Expedite Order’ process  was a sequence of 122 steps that  agents had to navigate, across a  series of applications, functions  and procedures, before they could  determine if a customer’s order  could or could not be expedited.
We brought in a combination of  analytics, artificial intelligence (AI)  and automation to intelligently  route requests to the agent best  equipped to resolve the issue, now  also amplified by fully-automated  processes delivered through an  integrated customer engagement  platform.
The results have been  dramatic.
Some customer queries  that typically took 20 hours to  process are now done in less than  5 minutes.
Another example is how we  are future-proofing a very large  global telecom company.
We are  modernizing the core to drive  operational agility, data-rich systems,  new ways of working, and flexible  omnichannel customer experience  across a five-year transformation  roadmap.
This involves the telecom’s  full stack, from the foundation  BSS / OSS layers in partnership  with Netcracker, through to the  CSS customer interaction layers,  created by using Adobe, UXP and  PegaSystems as both an omnichannel  enabler and decisioning layer.
All  this will ensure end-to-end digital  transformation driven by real-time,  contextual customer data to deliver  differentiated next best actions and  next best offers.
As our clients look to us for the edge  that would differentiate their digital  solutions to create an impact in an  increasingly uncertain, asymmetric  and complex world, we are leveraging  the breadth and depth of our digital  expertise to deliver for them.
We  are also empowering our clients to  transform their workplace experience  by leveraging technology to connect  their people – to knowledge, to  processes, to each other – to move  forward and do better.
This year, Infosys acquired Brilliant  Basics, a London-based product  design and customer experience  innovator known for their world- class Design Thinking-led approach  and experience in executing global  programs.
Over the past year, the  team has reimagined customer  experience across channels, including  the web, apps, ATM, kiosks, IVR, and  branches, for several global banks.
Many of these capabilities are now  being integrated with our Finacle®  suite of banking solutions to bring the  benefits of new digital experiences to  more of our clients.
We have also announced in April  2018 a definitive agreement to  acquire WONGDOODY , a US-based  full-service creative and consumer  insights agency.
The addition of near-shore capabilities  adds to our growing worldwide  network of digital studios, which  includes our expanding facilities in  Bengaluru and Pune, in India.
These  are focused on fulfilling the needs of  global clients for end-to-end digital  transformation solutions required to  meet the demand for next-generation  customer experience.
This is but  one step forward in the long path  we have charted to close the gap  for design and human-centric skills  in building highly usable technology  solutions.
It fits squarely into our outside-in  approach of focusing on service  design and experience at one end,  and renewal of legacy technologies,  processes, systems, and ways  of working at the other, helping  our clients meet rising customer  expectations, deliver personalized  experiences at scale, and do it all at  the speed of market.
“When it comes to customer experience, we continue to transform, learn and shape the next stages as we move  along our transformation journey.
The scale of change is hugely significant; we are changing not only our digital layer,  but our entire back office to ensure future-proof, operationally agile, and data-rich systems.
” – Sam Lloyd,  Chief Information Officer, Telenet Scott Sorokin SVP and Head, Global Services  – Digital Experience THE  CLIENT DIGITAL JOURNEY EXPERIENCE INSIGHT INNOVA TE ACCELERATE ASSURE 6 | Navigate your next  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18  Data is the  lifeblood of  the enterprise  that aspires to  be digital.
It is  that strategic  asset that helps  the business learn about evolving  opportunities, hidden threats,  changing customer expectations  and the competitive landscape,  in context and in time to respond  meaningfully.
This, in turn, helps to  automate the supply chain, drive  continuous innovation, and create  micro-moments-based customer  experience.
Artificial intelligence (AI) powers the core of this data-driven  enterprise and creates signals that  then act on the business to bring  transformational value.
When this is  enabled in a do-it-yourself culture,  everyone, at any given time, is able  to move quickly in the right direction  to defend, differentiate and even  reimagine the business.
We help our clients adopt this  approach to ubiquitously creating  value from data.
We move them away from  the conventional use case or  point-solution-led approach, towards  the path to building industrialized  capabilities to monetize data.
We  begin by creating an integrated  blueprint of opportunities – unique  to their businesses – for data-led  value creation.
Thereon we chart the  roadmap to incrementally build the  capabilities they need to deliver on  the blueprint.
This involves :   Modernizing the core to prepare for  the digital transformation    Building systems that interpret data  cognitively to discover new signals  and connect the unconnected    Leveraging AI to nurture a learnable  and adaptable enterprise that  evolves at digital speed Modernizing entails releasing data  and insights hidden in the legacy  landscape and creating a flexible  mesh of foundational services.
This foundation can then be broken  down into components that can be  dynamically organized in several  ways and automated to deliver  against an evolving context.
This  also often necessitates divesting or  modernizing the legacy systems that  lie at the core of the enterprise.
For  example, recently, we worked with  a retail mortgage bank, to advance  their ability to generate credit  scores for potential customers and  process applications in real time.
We  re-engineered their credit acquisition  decision engine and also transformed  their legacy mainframe environment  to improve its agility.
Today, the bank  generates applicant credit scores in  less than 50 milliseconds.
Having released data from the core,  the next task is to digitize the data  supply chain and turn it into an asset  that can be interpreted cognitively  and leveraged for making data-led  decisions across the enterprise.
We  do this for several of our clients in  the retailing business.
We work to  make sense of their structured and  unstructured data around consumer  actions, response to promotions,  SmartLabel scans, product affinities,  customer propensities, along with  price and promotion sensitivities.
We  then use machine learning models  to improve the recommendation  logic for their real-time product  promotions.
We put to use several AI models  to solve business problems in an  expert-assist, near-fully-automated  mode.
This allows for continuous  learning and continuous improvement  to be factored into both validated  and new models.
A case in point  is how this is delivering value for  our clients in the financial services  business.
We deploy AI techniques  to detect anomalies in data values  and transaction volumes that point  to suspicious events and then  alert decision-makers to potentially  fraudulent activities.
We even study  these patterns to predict incidents  and enable just-in-time prevention of  irregularities.
With this approach, enterprises can  build a fabric for data to become the  new internet, connecting all the dots  that matter, the driver of all enterprise  decisions, and the advantage that  everybody has equal access to.
With that, it will not be data that  differentiates the winning enterprises  from the also-rans.
It will be people –  amplified by this data, to be able to  make connections unseen before, to  find problems unarticulated before,  and to build solutions that solve the  unsolvable, through collaborative  relationships that benefit customers  in ways unexplored.
“Within ABN AMRO, we believe that we can generate true value from data by delivering innovative analytics  capabilities and enabling access to high-quality data.
We have demonstrated the first tangible results that created  such enthusiasm that we decided to overhaul our entire data management ecosystem.
We are implementing  modern and metadata-driven data distribution technologies and are adopting AI capabilities from public cloud  providers.
”  – Marcel Kramer IT Lead, Data Quality & Analytics, ABN AMRO Bank  Satish H.C. EVP and Head, Global Services  – Data & Analytics THE  CLIENT DIGITAL JOURNEY EXPERIENCE INSIGHT INNOVA TE ACCELERATE ASSURE AI-led insights will show your customers what to buy next Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 8 | Navigate your next  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18  Y our old machinery will be your next new IoT device Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 The highly  competitive  markets that our  clients serve  demand a severe  crunching of  cost and time  for them to remain relevant.
We  help them meet this challenge when  they engineer their products, by  digitizing the entire product lifecycle  – from design and manufacture to  maintenance and service.
In tandem with designing new  products or production lines, our  clients often have a portfolio of  long-lived products and assets that  must deliver to new expectations.
We believe, for the enterprise  that’s rich in engineering legacy and  looking to find new growth, there  lies a goldmine of opportunity – to  deftly build richer experiences by  infusing new technology into their  existing products.
Leveraging our  deep understanding of their broader  business context, we help our clients  uncover ways for technology to  create avenues for their products  to deliver more value.
The key  here is to not wish away their rich  legacy but revitalize it with newer  technology.
Like we did recently by  re-engineering a hardware monolith –  a Cable Modem Termination System  (CMTS) – into smaller software  components leveraging Software- defined networking / Network  functions virtualization (SDN / NFV) technology.
Our client, a cable  operator, can now bring up or down  the CMTS on demand and take it  closer to customer homes.
This will  save them both capital expenditure  and operational expenses.
We understand how vital it is to  recognize how the product or asset  is engineered – mechanically and  electronically, for us to then bring  the right software to amplify it.
This  means knowing the product’s entire  lifecycle – design, manufacturing,  assembly, customer operations, and  after-sales service.
For example,  uncovering value from IoT data  is a process of knowing exactly  what constitutes ‘desired’ product  behavior, tracking the gap between  real-world results and desired  results, and communicating this to  stakeholders who can investigate  why it occurred and prevent its  recurrence.
In fact, recently, in  partnership with an international  engineering firm, we developed an  AI-powered operational efficiency  framework to help manage large  plants with complex IoT -led  interconnected systems.
Our  clients are enthused about its  potential to revolutionize plant  operations by enhancing overall  system performance, availability and  reliability, in addition to managing the  risks of disrupted production.
While our aspiration is to help our  clients better leverage their existing  assets, our IoT services are focused  on impacting both their top line  and bottom line.
Today, enterprises  leverage our IoT capabilities to  remote-monitor products and  assets, prevent breakdowns, and  analyze data from sample assets  to optimize performance across  the entire production line.
Having  this view into how each product  or asset operates is not just key to  improving their efficiency but also to  ensuring security along with legal and  regulatory compliance.
In addition,  we have also brought in IoT to help  our clients explore new business  models that offer products as  services with usage-based pricing.
The value we have been able to bring  to our clients this last year, through  our IoT offerings, is indicative of  how more and more enterprises  are trying to transform their product  engineering and take advantage of  technologies like SDN, Augmented  Reality / Virtual Reality, Robotics,  Autonomous Technology and Additive  Manufacturing.
For example, we have  developed a robotic arm-based test  automation framework to automate  the hardware and software testing  of point-of-sale and mobile devices.
We are also actively re-engineering  critical metallic components for  a leading turbo-machine maker,  through Additive Manufacturing.
We have a deep appreciation for the  need to re-skill and upskill our own  people so they can embrace and  share the value of these emerging  technologies.
To accelerate their  continuous and lifelong learning in  these domains, we are investing  significantly in educational  interventions – including partnering  with Udacity to train our people in  the skills we need as a company  to deepen focus on Autonomous  Technology.
Our opportunity clearly lies in  bringing together knowledge of  the new possibilities created by  emerging technologies, knowledge  of how products are engineered, and  knowledge of the industries they  serve, to uncover avenues to amplify,  with software, the value these  products deliver.
“IoT solutions are developed and deployed to achieve specific business outcomes; as such, it is critical to provide  the complete solution stack.
Cisco is focused on engineering specific products and platforms which provide  customers with complete solutions to realize business benefits.
Systems integrators play an important role in  customizing these IoT solutions and making sure that the expected benefits are fully realized, thus forming an  important link in the IoT value chain.
” – Jayaram Beladakere  Director, Product Management, Cisco Sudip Singh SVP and Head, Global Services  – Engineering, and Industry  Head – Services, Utilities,  Resources and Energy THE  CLIENT DIGITAL JOURNEY EXPERIENCE INSIGHT INNOVA TE ACCELERATE ASSURE 10 | Navigate your next  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18  Modernize the core before you make your next move Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 To thrive, even  to survive,  enterprises  must be able to  rapidly transform  themselves  or watch  a born-digital competitor woo  their customers away.
For most  established companies, the toughest  struggle is with their monolithic  legacy that can’t pivot to support  their aspirations.
These often-siloed  systems, built on older technology  and surrounded mostly by archaic  processes, have, over a period of  time, become fairly complex and  inextricably interlinked to support  expansive operations.
The fear of  disrupting these operations, making  large new investments, and tackling  the need for new skills to manage  the transformation make it hard for  enterprises to shrug off their legacy.
But there is a way forward.
The journey to organizational  modernization and enterprise agility  can be phased, at one’s chosen  pace, based on carefully chosen  business priorities and executed  through a combination of core  renewals that create efficiency-led  savings that can then be redirected  to simultaneously building agile new  systems of engagement.
We help our  clients do this by bringing together a  combination of strategies for legacy  landscape renewal including the  following :  a) Massive simplification of core  systems from monolithic and  interdependent to platform-led,  lightly-tied components built on  open source software.
For example,  for an Asian bank, we are working  to transform their 36-year-old  mainframe system, running  on proprietary technology, to a  more loosely-coupled, extensible  architecture.
We are already  beginning to see encouraging early  outcomes like a 30% reduction  in their loan processing time and  improved customer experience.
b) Carving out fire lanes of  microservices and APIs (Application  Programming Interfaces)  around the core that opens it  up to customer-focused digital  transformation.
We did this with  significant success for a direct seller  of personal care products.
We helped  them build a robust API management  strategy and microservices  architecture to support their new  responsive website and an agile  social selling platform with over 230  applications serving a market spread  across 100 countries.
c) Bringing cloud-readiness to the  legacy landscape so that it can be  migrated to the cloud.
We help our  clients chart out and execute a cloud  strategy to not only transition their  non-differentiating workloads to the  cloud, but to also transform their  businesses with the cloud.
Contrary to popular perception,  enterprises have huge untapped  potential to exploit cloud-based  technologies and in most cases, this  entails choosing a hybrid approach  involving hosted or private cloud and  public cloud options.
The journey  of enterprise workloads moving to  the cloud is just about starting and  this would be an ideal time for most  enterprises to embark on their own  path to the future.
There are enough  proven technologies and solutions  to help most of these enterprises  meet their needs today, and this  mitigates the perceived risks of cloud  transformation.
Leveraging Infosys Enterprise Cloud  Ecosystem capabilities, we advise our  clients on their cloud transformation  strategy across infrastructure, data,  applications and more, and then  build and co-evolve their enterprise  cloud.
We don’t just deliver managed  services, but also help our clients  tap into new revenue streams.
That’s  exactly what happened with an  airline manufacturer we serve.
They  wanted to ease the struggle their  customers faced when trying to find  the right documentation to maintain  their aircraft.
We build a secure public  cloud platform to host their product  manuals for anytime-anywhere  access.
While this saved them over a  million dollars in customer servicing  costs, they also shared this facility  with other aircraft manufacturers  offering documentation-hosting as  a subscription-based service that  generated significant new revenues  for them in the very first year.
We also understand and leverage  the role that DevOps and Agile  play, integrated with open source  advantage, to support our clients’  need for on-demand and automated  IT on their path to modernization.
This, and every other modernization  tactic we deploy, is part of a  custom-strategy we carefully chart  for every individual client to build in  the changeability they need to make  the necessary agile shifts through  changing times – continuously  digitizing the core at one end and  amplifying consumer experience at  the other – to stay ever-relevant.
“ As enterprises like us embark on the digital journey, cloud plays a very important role.
It is not just about moving  workloads to cloud but about business value through agility, driving customer insights and most importantly,  enhancing experience.
” – Neal Johnson Director of Business Technology, House of Fraser Narsimha Rao M. EVP and Head, Global  Services – Cloud, Infrastructure  and Security Solutions &  Independent Validation Solutions THE  CLIENT DIGITAL JOURNEY EXPERIENCE INSIGHT INNOVA TE ACCELERATE ASSURE 12 | Navigate your next  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18  Almost every  CIO and CISO we  speak to tells us  how consumed  they are by the  demands of  predicting and  preventing security incidents in an  expanding threat landscape.
The  challenge of cyber security has long  since moved beyond monitoring  infrastructure, networks, firewalls and  IT assets to include the protection  of the entire value chain – systems,  applications, user software, developer  software and data.
For global enterprises seeking  to build a more digital future for  themselves, the transformation  journey invariably extends from core  modernization to customer delight.
Because their core is most likely a  monolithic legacy system, the road  to digitization, for them, entails  Application Programming Interface  (API) fire-laning so their legacy  landscapes can communicate with  new platform-based components  and open source software solutions.
These APIs, while providing a  window from the core into new  applications, also inadvertently  intensify cyber security risks.
Then  of course, the path to modernization  also leads to the cloud.
As this  digitization scales, an elaborate cyber  security setup becomes mission- critical, even inevitable.
That’s why  we offer defense-in-depth to our  clients.
On the other hand, hackers continue  to innovate.
To that, the typical  enterprise responds by bolting on  more point solutions.
Often, the  result is a patchwork of solutions that  not only don’t work well together,  but are inadequate to protect  against evolving threats that are  now spread across an attack surface  with thousands of potential entry  points, including those created by  smartphones and Internet of Things  (IoT) devices.
Little wonder, CISOs  find themselves managing ‘reactive  security’ rather than driving ‘holistic  resilience’.
The need of the hour is flexible and  adaptive security solutions, delivered  in an integrated package.
When  these are consumed ‘as-a-service’,  enterprises will have the flexibility to  prioritize not just rapid remediation,  but also plan for anticipatory  protection.
It removes the huge  operational and cost overheads  required to manage a fragmented  landscape with point solutions pieced  together.
The CIO and CISO can,  instead, focus on accelerating the  enterprise’s digital agenda.
That’s  precisely what the Infosys Cyber  Security Platform enables.
Built with  AI-driven automation at its core, it  helps the custodians of enterprise  security to transition from a  fragmented and reactive approach to  a managed security services model  guided by a customized roadmap.
For example, for one of our clients  – a beverage manufacturer – the  platform brings together an optimized  tool suite and the strong predictive  capabilities needed to protect  them against advanced threats – all  the while providing 24x7 security  monitoring services, along with  identity and access management  services, for their 40,000+ users and  over 500 applications.
Complementing the value that our  cyber security platform brings is  our network of Security Operations  Centers (SOCs), already operational  in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune  in India, along with centers at our  clients’ premises.
These SOCs bring  together best-in-class skills and a  constantly updated solutions suite,  along with managed services for  security operations delivered round- the-clock through a network of  inter-connected, global facilities.
Our  clients also have access to advanced  threat-hunting capabilities and the  latest in technology innovations  for cyber security incubated in the  Infosys Security R&D Labs.
This  is our investment in continuously  improving our core services portfolio,  expanding our offerings into new  areas of potential threat, and  leveraging our innovation ecosystem  to co-create solutions that deepen  the value we deliver.
The value that technology brings  to cyber security, while immense  in itself, is best leveraged as a  means to amplify human potential.
Un-automatable tasks like imagining  new avenues for breaches, finding  new problems, and creating  innovative solution combinations  can only be performed by people.
That’s why we are fully committed  to nurturing and improving our  engineers’ skills and expertise in  these domains through strong  academic partnerships like the  one we have forged with Purdue  University.
For us, each of these advances, in  the past year, has been a step up in  boosting the security posture of our  clients so they can go about their  business with greater confidence.
“Cyber security is foundational for enterprises such as ours as we proceed through our digital transformation.
It is more than merely responding to events as they occur; it is crucial that we build solutions for predictive threat  management and automated incident resolution.
To achieve this requires fully-integrated security platforms that  operate in ways that point solutions cannot” .

Each one  of the 48 clients I met during the  previous quarter is a strong believer  in our long-standing, market-leading,  service delivery strength.
In fact,  they are keen that we build upon  our knowledge of their technology  foundation and support them on their  digital journey.
I also learnt about  the sense of tremendous pride our  employees have in their work for  our clients.
To increase our relevance to our  clients, we have embarked on our  strategy of ‘Navigate your next’.
To achieve this, we have defined the  following four strategic imperatives :   Scale Agile Digital   Energize the core   Re-skill our employees, and   Localize in our key markets Scale Agile Digital Our clients are moving rapidly on  their digital journey.
We have built,  over the years, a formidable position  in the digital space – US$ 2.79 billion  of our revenue in fiscal 2018 came  from these digital services.
Our  digital framework drives business  outcomes for our clients across  five areas – Experience, Insight,  Innovate, Accelerate, and Assure.
This reflects how we are thinking  about our clients’ journey as they  make progress through their digital  transformation.
This also guides our  own aspirations and efforts to build  digital capability in service of our  clients’ needs.
Letter to the shareholder | 19 Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 “Today, our clients are at different points in their digital  journey.
We are positioning our capabilities to help them  navigate their next, across the different dimensions of  this journey.” Energize the core Our core business is the cornerstone  of our company and the critical  element that has helped us build  enormous client trust and loyalty.
With advances in artificial intelligence  and automation, we have the ability  to make these core services even  more efficient and effective for our  clients.
Our Nia platform is a critical  element in this landscape.
Re-skill our employees In working alongside our clients on  their digital journey, we are actively  working with our employees to  enable their re-skilling.
Our platform,  Lex, makes learning accessible,  relevant, fun, and drives outcomes  that matter.
Increasingly, we are  taking this learning to our client  organizations as well.
Localize in our key markets We are embarking on building  more local capabilities, especially in  America, Europe, and Australia, to  ensure we expand our relevance to  our clients.
We announced our first  campus for development and training  in Indiana, US, and innovation hubs in  other cities.
With the articulation of our strategic  direction, we have launched a  transformation program for the  company to drive the execution of  the initiatives that will help us achieve  the outcomes envisaged.
This is a  three-year transformation program  that will help position Infosys for  increased client relevance.
Our fiscal 2018 results are  detailed in this annual report and  demonstrate the underlying strength  of our business.
Our revenue was  US$ 10.9 billion, which grew at  5.8% in constant currency from  the previous year.
Our operating  margin was 24.3% and profit  after tax was US$ 2.5 billion.
Cash  provided by operating activities was  US$ 2.3 billion.
Thank you to each one of our 1,200  clients!
Their trust and belief in us  has enabled us to be the company  we are.
The dedication of our over 2,00,000  employees to drive outcomes for our  clients is a testament to the results  we have shown in fiscal 2018 and the  continuing strength of our institution.
Thank you to each one of them.
Our exceptional leadership team  has helped steer the company  through the past several years and  also helped design our strategic  framework and the transformation  program.
My thanks to them for their  energy and commitment in helping  me operationalize our strategy.
Today, as I look out of the window  in my office at the lush green  trees across our stunning campus  in Bengaluru, I feel a sense of  excitement – at the opportunities in  the technology world as our clients  are moving on their digital journey  and the consequent opportunity  for us to help them navigate their  next.
I feel a sense of pride at the  incredible institution that has been  built over the past 37 years that gives  us a strong foundation for what we  can create in the future.
With my warmest regards, Bengaluru  May 8, 2018 Salil Parekh Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director 20 | Of navigators – natural and nurtured Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 OF NAVIGATORS –  NATURAL AND NURTURED U.B.
Pravin Rao Chief Operating Officer   and Whole-time Director Letting go of the familiar, to navigate  to the next, is not always easy.
But so  often it’s inevitable.
As inescapable  for naturals like the Arctic terns –  those ambitious navigators that chart  their migratory flight from the North  Pole to the South and back – as it  is for enterprises that must learn to  steer through the turbulence of digital  disruption to find their future.
Incumbent companies – often  large and successful businesses  that thrived for decades before  the emergence of this pervasive  digitalization – can sometimes feel  like they must fight the winds that  seem to be propelling everybody  but them forward.
Y et, we believe  that incumbents too can adapt, and  leverage the resources they have – a  strong brand, significant capital, long- standing customer relationships and  decades of institutional knowledge  – to find and take advantage of  opportunities amidst the disruption.
We should know.
We are an  incumbent too.
We also know that being digital  means making far-reaching changes  that go beyond simply investing in  the latest digital technologies.
It  means reimagining operating models,  considering how best to refactor and  invigorate talent with digital skills,  and looking afresh to engage in ways  customers find valuable.
Today, we  are well on our way to executing our  strategy to accomplish exactly that.
In fact, our promise to our clients is  to be their navigator as they chart  their path to a more digital future.
The strength of our conviction comes  from the fact that each tenet of the  strategy we recommend for them, is  already working for us.
We are navigating, step by step,  towards new digital opportunities  while smartly leveraging our  traditional strengths – our core  services.
In the past three years, we  have embraced artificial intelligence- based automation techniques and  software automation platforms to  boost the productivity of our core  service delivery.
Infosys Nia®, our  next-generation intelligent automation  platform, and AssistEdge®, our  Robotic Process Automation  platform, have been key to bringing  machine learning and automation  together with deep knowledge of  our business to industrialize our  core landscape.
Simultaneously,  through Project Infynity, we are also  transforming our delivery practices in  a holistic modernization journey that  will bring the agility we seek to our  processes.
These productivity and efficiency  gains are enabling us to make  Of navigators – natural and nurtured | 21 Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 targeted investments to accelerate  our Agile Digital business.
We  are boosting our digital delivery  capabilities and priority services,  including customer experience  amplification, data analytics, product  engineering, cloud migration,  cyber security, automation and  platform-based business process  management.
We are applying these  first to our own context.
For example,  today, Infosys hybrid cloud enables  on-demand self-service provisioning,  while doubling capacity, without  increasing costs.
We are beginning  to manage our unstructured data  with Penny-a-GB (PeG) – our  peta-scale, software-defined  storage.
Mobile-first solutions drive  all our critical business, learning  and collaboration processes.
Our  Information System processes are  simplified, reducing cumulative effort  for critical processes by up to 80%.
We have made significant progress in  our workplace transformation journey  as well, even as proactive cyber  defense nurtures the digital trust we  need to continue to push through to  the future.
We are also incubating new  offerings in areas such as blockchain,  Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality  and speech, vision, video and image  intelligence, in collaboration with  universities, research organizations  and our innovation ecosystem.
Y et, we understand that each of  these separate initiatives must come  together seamlessly to turn it into  a balanced, integrated program of  change.
It’s only our people who can  ‘glue’ it all together.
But only when  they develop a deep appreciation for  the digital culture.
We nurture this  by driving talent re-skilling at scale  for our employees in the new areas  of digital services.
In many ways,  this comes naturally to us because  teaching and learning has always  been our lifeblood.
Whether it’s our  investments in our Global Education  Center at Mysuru, India; in advanced,  anytime-anywhere learning systems  such as our Lex platform; or our  relationships with universities around  the world to curate specific curricula,  in areas such as creative design  skills, machine learning, autonomous  technologies and blockchain, our  enthusiasm for lifelong learning  remains unrivalled.
We are also investing in localizing  our workforce in the geographies  we work in, because we believe that  the benefits of digital transformation  are often better realized contextually.
We have announced the setting  up of four delivery and innovation  centers in the US.
The first of these  is already active in Indianapolis, while  three others – in Connecticut, Rhode  Island and North Carolina – are well  on the way to becoming operational.
We are also recruiting locally from  universities in the US.
We aim to  scale this effort to include our key  markets in Europe and Australia  as well.
These strategic initiatives –  energizing our core, scaling Agile  Digital, re-skilling our people and  expanding our localization – are  helping us find our next.
So we can  look forward to an opportunity-filled  future.
Much like the Arctic terns do.
Their  migratory patterns allow them to  experience two summers in one year,  every year – and that’s more than  most other creatures in the world can  hope for!

24 | Being local.
Globally.
Ravi Kumar S. President and Deputy Chief   Operating Officer To be impactful, ideas and programs  – whether modestly scoped  improvements or ambitious business  reinvention – must be tied closely to  the ebb and flow of the people they  seek to serve.
That’s why localization  has such a significant role to play in  accelerating and scaling the digital  transformation of enterprises, and  we want to bring the full force of this  advantage to our clients.
A first step in this direction, for  us, is building strong in-market  presence in those parts of the world  where we have our deepest client  clusters.
Last year, we committed  to hiring 10,000 American workers  and establishing Technology and  Innovation Hubs in the United  States, over the next two years, to  help nurture the next generation  of innovators for our increasingly  digital future.
Today, the first of our  technology and innovation hubs is  already active in Indianapolis.
Three  other hubs are well on the way to  becoming operational and more than  3,000 American workers have been  welcomed into the Infosys family.
An interesting fact that differentiates  our expanding localization is the way  we are transitioning our conventional  hub-and-spoke talent model, with the  hubs primarily anchored in our India  development centers, to a networks  talent model – building talent  pools in our markets, closer to our  clients to deliver and deploy digital  solutions in co-creative cycles of agile  development.
We are bringing to  our fold local talent – not just freshly  minted engineers but customer  experience designers and graduates  from liberal arts backgrounds – who  can serve the various dimensions  of our clients’ digital agenda.
In  fact, beyond leveraging this talent  pool for them, we are sharing with  our clients our entire talent value  chain – recruiting, training and even  refactoring their human resources  – which is so essential for them  to scale digital and navigate their  transformation.
In the months to follow, it’s only  natural that we replicate what we  have so successfully accomplished in  the US in our key markets in Europe  and Australia as well.
After all, being  the navigator of our clients’ digital  journey is not just about steering  them through to their next milestone,  but also a voyage through the  contours, context and culture unique  to each of them.
BEING LOCAL.
GLOBALL Y .
Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 From the frontline | 25  Mohit Joshi President It’s no longer business as usual for  our clients.
In a digitally disrupted  world, it’s essential that businesses  commit to nurturing new ways of  working so that they can establish  a foothold in a rapidly changing  landscape.
It is the technology and  the mindset that together make  for a winning combination.
The  unique opportunity before us, then,  is to steer our clients through their  transformation.
To convincingly make  the ‘navigate your next’ promise to  them, and to keep it.
That’s why, this year, we accelerated  investments in amplifying our brand  and building perception around how  we help our clients nurture new  digital capabilities.
We also focused  on making Infosys an attractive  employer brand in our key markets  where we are fast-tracking hiring  from in-market talent pools to serve  our clients’ digital agenda.
Today, we are also widely refactoring  our own talent in areas like AI-led  analytics, digital experience,  and cyber security.
This includes  creating on-demand avenues for  our salesforce to participate in  the learning, so they are well- prepared to reset our clients’ path  to change at scale.
They are now  fully equipped to share the value of  the industry-specific digital solution  stacks, that we’ve built, with our  clients.
Our design studios and  innovation labs furnish them with  the ‘show and tell’ aids they need to  demonstrate proof-of-value.
We continue to mine for and grow  business in our large accounts, by  creating the right ‘flying formation’  of experts including specialists from  our vibrant partner ecosystem.
Conducting Design Thinking  workshops, finding new ways to deal  with sticky old problems, and setting  up client-specific training academies  are integral to this process.
Large  deals too are a well-oiled growth  engine as we invest energies in  building a robust pipeline on one  end, while improving the win rate  on the other.
Not unlike every year,  we have added significantly to the  very impressive roster of clients we  already have.
This year, the number  stands at 283 additional names.
We’re also focused on expanding  our footprint and are making  investments in new geographies and  in underpenetrated subverticals.
To us, this progress we’ve made,  resonates with our aspiration to  partner with our clients not merely to  help them respond to the challenges  of a changing reality, but to pave their  way to a sustainable digital future.

Human resources management The Human Resources (HR) department at Infosys is  driven by the mission : • To help Infoscions realize their potential – to develop,  grow and achieve their purpose • To build the right culture and capabilities to enable us to  delight our customers • To make Infosys the best place to work for passionate,  innovative people who want to make a difference HR management at Infosys goes beyond the set boundaries  of compensation, performance reviews and development.
We  look at the employee’s entire work-life cycle, to ensure timely  interventions that help build a long-lasting and fruitful career.
With this in mind, we initiated several positive changes in our  HR practice this year.
We have set up a scalable recruitment and HR management  process.
Over the last year, on a standalone basis, we  received 15,40,498 applications from prospective employees.
The Infosys Group added 3,743 (net) and 44,110 (gross)  employees this year, taking the total strength to 2,04,107  from 2,00,364 at the end of the previous year.

Here are some of the initiatives we have pioneered this year,  along with recognition received for the same : • Zero Distance (ZD), the movement to bring innovation  to every project at Infosys, continued into its third year.
The total number of ZD plans increased to over 16,000,  many of which were discussed with clients, as the focus  this year was on the monetization of ZD plans.
In addition,  we rewarded employees throughout the year for their  innovative work through various awards at the unit and  organization levels.
• We moved from an annual employee engagement survey  model to a more continuous and customized survey format  for feedback.
This new approach has seen good traction  over the year, with insights gathered from various sections  of employees throughout the annual period.
These insights  have led to the creation of tracks for actionizing.
To help  trickle the information back into the teams, all managers  have access to a dashboard containing feedback from their  respective teams.
• In response to the technology disruptions that are  transforming our business, we have continued to empower  employees by letting them take charge of their careers and  learning journeys.
With a focus on preparing employees  for tomorrow, we have enabled them to create and charter  career and learning paths on Compass, our internal  digital career platform.
Through Compass, we provide  our employees a world of opportunities – be it internal  career movements, mentoring, learning, internships and  more.
Employees can also make use of experiences like  ‘Power Programmers’ (to build capability in emerging and  high-end technologies).
In addition, for our Managers, we  have created MaQ, an innovative analytics-based tool that  equips them to stay abreast of technology and also makes  them future-ready .
Through these initiatives we continue  to ensure that our employees are exposed to compelling  career opportunities and have access to learning anytime,  anywhere.
• We continued to focus on employee safety as an important  aspect of providing a great place to work.
We revamped  many of our processes and tech offerings, and launched the  Infosys Emergency App for employees to get quick help  during an emergency .
We revised our workplace guidelines  and security infrastructure to make them more robust.
We  continuously communicated with employees on available  safety measures to increase awareness, benchmarked our  work in this space against the best that is on offer, and  sought regular feedback from employees to ensure their  involvement in making Infosys even more safe and secure.
• The Next Gen Talent Management Model was taken one  step further this year with the launch of a dashboard and  system that captures all employee data for easy , data-driven  decision-making.
The system was launched to business  leaders to give them deeper analytical insights into their  teams.

Rewards and recognition, in terms of the annual awards  for excellence, quarterly promotions, and unit awards,  continued.
• The stock incentives program was leveraged for  rewarding and retaining our high-potential employees  and senior leadership.
• We were ranked second among 250+ companies which  participated in the AVTAR Best Companies for Women  Score Card on Safety in India To foster a positive workplace environment, free from  harassment of any nature, we have institutionalized the  Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) framework,  through which we address complaints of sexual harassment  at the workplace.
Our global policy assures discretion and  guarantees non-retaliation to complainants.
We follow a  gender-neutral approach in handling complaints of sexual  harassment and we are compliant with the law of the land  wherever we operate.
We have also constituted an Internal  44 | Board’s report Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Complaints Committee (ICC) in all locations across India  to consider and address sexual harassment complaints  in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at  Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

Education, training and assessment Infosys believes in lifelong learning for its employees, and  competency development continues to be a key area of  strategic focus for us.
Our Education, Training and Assessment  (ETA) department is at the forefront of creating a culture of  learning in the organization.
In the age of disruption, whether  it is Digital, AI, Machine Learning (ML) or other emerging  technologies, we created more than 75 new courses for our  employees to embrace new and emerging technologies and  be future-ready .
We now have about 250 internally created  self-learning programs focusing on the key foundations  and real-life examples (including flight simulators), making  them market-relevant effectively .
These are in addition to  the 1,500+ courses and 3,600 micro-learning videos already  available.
We recently built a new learning platform called  Lex.
Lex is a highly scalable and modular learning platform  that allows our employees to access learning content from  anywhere, from any device, at any time, and learn at a time  convenient for them.
Employees can even download the  content and access it later when they are offline as well.
With  this, we are able to achieve our goal of enabling ‘Learning on  the Go’ for our employees.
To ensure that we have systemic intervention in place  to re-skill our existing employees in new and emerging  technologies, we created a recommendation engine to suggest  appropriate learning paths based on the adjacency skills they  possess currently , and created learning stacks to provide an  end-to-end view of technology and industry best practices.
This helps us bring our re-skilling programs in line with our  growth projections and address our employees’ aspirations.
Building up on our extensive experience in India, we started  enabling fresh hires in the US at various places like Raleigh,  Indianapolis, Plano etc., and making them project-ready .
We have collaborated with local universities and MOOC  providers in the US for various educational offerings.
For  example, we are working with Rhode Island School of Design  to train our employees on digital and design skills, and  working with Udacity to train some of our fresh hires in the  US, to offer their Nanodegree programs to our fresh hires in  India, and ‘Self Driving Car Engineer’ Nanodegree program  to our experienced employees.
Similarly we are working with  Coursera to enable our employees on Google Cloud Platform.
Campus Connect, our industry-academia partnership  program, made progress with the launch of electives to help  engineering colleges run new programs within their curricula.
In fiscal 2018, we engaged with 1,052 faculty members who  in turn trained 40,139 students.
With this, the total number  of beneficiaries covered has reached 15,219 faculty members  and 4,56,324 students from 286 engineering institutions.
Infosys Leadership Institute Infosys Leadership Institute (ILI) embraces a customized  approach to host initiatives aligned to specific development  needs of the senior leadership team.
Our business leaders,  along with HR business partners, identify needs for  their respective talent pool through formal talent review  discussions.
These themes help us to evolve our learning  calendar of open programs called Leadership Labs.
We had  over 200 leaders nominated across functions, subsidiaries  and technologies, resulting in a diverse mix across locations,  focused on leadership facets like executive presence,  storytelling etc.
To provide deep dive into specific skills, we  launched four Leadership Tracks for 45 leaders, spanning a  period of 3-6 months.
In partnership with Stanford Graduate  School of Business, we had two cohorts comprising 38 and  65 leaders who completed their graduation during the year.

Renewable energy : During the year, we augmented the  capacity of our solar installations.
Currently , we have a total  installed capacity of around 46.2 MW across our campuses,  including on-the-roof and ground-mount solar installations.
The total percentage of renewables in electricity consumption  is around 43% for fiscal 2018.
We also achieved around 3%  reduction in per capita electricity consumption.
Green buildings : With LEED new construction, GRIHA and  existing building certifications, we now have 11.7 million  sq.
ft. of highest rated green buildings across campuses.
In  fiscal 2018, two of our buildings – Software Development  Building (SDB) 1 in Jaipur, and SDB A/B in Bhubaneswar –  were awarded the US Green Building Council LEED Platinum  rating and the LEED India Platinum rating respectively .
We  now have 19 LEED Platinum-rated buildings and four GRIHA  5-star rated buildings.
Retrofits : The deep green retrofits in air conditioning, UPS  systems, lighting and other systems have helped us reduce 32  MW in connected load in the last seven years.
This initiative  helped us investigate and address new opportunities like  indoor air quality and thermal comfort in our infrastructure.
Carbon neutrality : In line with our commitment to becoming  carbon-neutral and focusing on social development alongside  carbon emission reduction, we have implemented six  community-based carbon offset projects.
As of fiscal 2018,  our project portfolio includes a household biogas project,  four high-efficiency biomass cook stove projects and one rural  electrification project.
During fiscal 2018, we carried out a  third-party verification of the carbon offset generated by these  projects since the beginning of their implementation.
The  third-party verifications were carried out by UN-approved  verifying agencies.
The current portfolio of offset projects  has generated about 1,53,309 tCO2e as of March 31, 2018.
At the same time, our projects have positively impacted the  lives of over 1,00,000 families (5,00,000 individuals) across  five states in India.
Water management : During the year, we achieved a per capita  reduction in the consumption of fresh water of around 19%  using efficient fixtures, wastewater treatment technologies,  reuse of treated wastewater, rainwater harvesting and smart  meters that help us monitor our consumption in real time to  eliminate water wastage.

Industry structure and developments Software and computing technology is transforming  businesses in every industry around the world in a profound  and fundamental way .
The continued reduction in the unit  cost of hardware, the explosion of network bandwidth,  advanced software technologies and technology-enabled- services are fueling the rapid digitization of business  processes and information.
The digital revolution is cascading  across industries, redefining customer expectations, enabling  disruptive market offerings and automating core processes.
Traditional business models are being disrupted with digital  and software-based business models.
This disruption is  characterized by personalized user experiences, innovative  products and services, extreme cost performance and a  disintermediation of the supply chain.
Incumbent companies,  to win amid this disruption, need to reinvent their business  from the core to activate strong efficiency and productivity  levers, reimagine the end consumer experience and  create impact at scale.
Leveraging technologies and models of the digital era to both  extend the value of existing investments and, in parallel,  transform and future-proof businesses, is increasingly  becoming a top strategic imperative for business leaders.
From an IT perspective, the renewal translates to harnessing  the efficiency of distributed cloud computing, enabling  legacy systems for mobile and sensor access, extracting  value out of digitized data, keeping systems relevant and  optimizing the costs of building and running technology  systems.
As businesses look to new areas and new economics,  new and intelligent systems are required to be built with  next-generation technologies and with exponentially superior  cost-benefit performance.
The fast pace of technology change and the need for technology  professionals who are highly skilled in both traditional and  digital technology areas are driving businesses to rely on  third parties to realize their business transformation.
Several  technology solution and service providers have emerged over  the years, offering different models for clients to consume  their solution and service offerings : • Niche technology consulting companies – who take on  time-bound and limited-scope projects for their clients • Global technology outsourcing companies – who leverage  global talent pools to enable business transformation and  systematically optimize the IT operations of clients • Business process management firms – who leverage global  talent pools to manage outsourced core business processes  of their clients 84 | Management’s discussion and analysis Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 • Software firms – who provide licensed software that enable  the automation of business processes • Specialty platform and Software-as-a-Service companies –  who provide utility-based models for clients to consume  software features • Data analytics companies – who specialize in designing,  analyzing and reporting insights from the vast amount of  data that corporations are collecting about their customers,  operations and markets • Internal IT departments of the companies themselves,  which are usually a cost center for the corporation.

Provision for tax We have provided for our tax liability both in India  and overseas.
The applicable Indian corporate statutory  tax rate for both the years ended March 31, 2018 and  March 31, 2017 is 34.61%.
In India, we have benefitted from certain tax incentives  that the Company has provided for the export of software  from units registered under Software Technology Park (STP)  Scheme and we continue to benefit from certain tax incentives  for the units registered under the SEZ Act, 2005.
However,  the income tax incentives provided by the Government of  India for STP units have expired, and the income from all  of our STP units are now taxable.
SEZ units, which began  providing services on or after April 1, 2005, are eligible for  a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the  export of services for the first five years from the financial  year in which the unit has commenced the provision of  services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five  years.
Up to 50% of such profits or gains for further five years  thereafter is subject to the creation of a Special Economic  Zone Re-investment Reserve out of the profit of the eligible  SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company  for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its  business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
As a result of these tax incentives, a portion of pre-tax income  has not been subject to income tax.

On a consolidated basis, the effective  tax rate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was 20.9% and 28.0%,  respectively .
Effective tax rate is generally influenced by  various factors including non-deductible expenses, exempt  non-operating income, overseas taxes, benefits from SEZ  units, tax reversals and other tax deductions.
The decrease  in effective tax rate from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017 was mainly  due to reversal of income tax expense on account of APA,  decrease in taxes on account of changes in US federal tax  reforms, increase in other tax reversals (net), partially offset  by increase in tax expense on account of dividend distribution  tax pertaining to subsidiaries.
The Company has concluded an APA with the IRS for the US  branch covering the years ending March 2011 to March 2021.
Under the APA, the Company and the IRS have agreed on the  methodology to allocate revenues and compute the taxable  income of the Company’s US branch operations.
The Company  expects the APA will enhance predictability of the Company’s  tax obligation in respect of its US operations.
Accordingly  the Company has reversed income tax expense provision of  ` 1,432 crore (US$ 225 million) which pertains to previous  periods.
Consequently , profits for fiscal 2018 have increased  and therefore, led to an increase in basic earnings per share  of ` 5.85 per share and ` 5.88 per share on a standalone and  consolidated basis, respectively , for the year ended March  31, 2018.
In line with the APA, the Company has to pay an  amount of approximately ` 1,488 crore (US$ 233 million) due  to the difference between the taxes payable for prior periods  as per the APA and the actual taxes paid for such periods.
The  Company has paid ` 479 crore (US$ 74 million) during the  three months ended March 31, 2018, and the balance amount  is expected to be paid over the next few quarters.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.
1) was signed into law on  December 22, 2017 (‘US tax reforms’).
The US tax reforms  have reduced federal tax rates from 35% to 21% effective  January 1, 2018, among other measures.
During the year  ended March 31, 2018, the US tax reforms have resulted in  a positive impact of ` 155 crore (US$ 24 million) on account  of credits pertaining to deferred tax liabilities on branch  profit.
The impact of US tax reforms is expected to be not  significant for future periods.

• Economic slowdown or other factors may affect the  economic health of the US, UK, EU, Australia or those  industries where our revenues are concentrated.
• A large part of our revenues are dependent on our top  clients, and the loss of any one of our major clients could  significantly impact our business.
• We may not be able to provide end-to-end business  solutions for our clients, which could lead to clients  discontinuing their work with us, which in turn could  harm our business.
• Intense competition in the market for technology services  could affect our win rates and pricing, which could  reduce our share of business from clients and decrease  our revenues and / or our profits.
• Our engagements with customers are typically singular  in nature and do not necessarily provide for subsequent  engagements.
• Our business will suffer if we fail to anticipate and develop  new services and enhance existing services in order to  keep pace with rapid changes in technology and in the  industries on which we focus.
100 | Management’s discussion and analysis Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 • We may be unable to recoup investment costs incurred in  developing our software products and platforms.

• Goodwill that we carry on our Balance Sheet could give  rise to significant impairment charges in the future.
• Our expenses are difficult to predict and can vary  significantly from period to period, which could cause our  share price to decline.
• Any inability to manage our growth could disrupt our  business, reduce our profitability and adversely impact  our ability to implement our growth strategy .
• Wage pressures in India and the hiring of employees  outside India may prevent us from sustaining some of our  competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margins.
• We are investing substantial cash assets in new facilities  and physical infrastructure, and our profitability could be  reduced if our business does not grow proportionately .
• Currency fluctuations and declining interest rates may  affect the results of our operations.
• Our success depends largely upon our highly-skilled  technology professionals and our ability to hire, attract,  motivate, retain and train these personnel.
• Our success depends in large part upon our management  team and key personnel and our ability to attract and  retain them.
• Our failure to complete fixed-price and fixed-timeframe  contracts, or transaction-based pricing contracts, within  budget and on time, may negatively affect our profitability .
• Our client contracts can typically be terminated without  cause and with little or no notice or penalty , which could  negatively impact our revenues and profitability .
• Our client contracts are often conditioned upon our  performance, which, if unsatisfactory , could result in lower  revenues than previously anticipated.

• An increase in anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain  countries in which we operate, including the US, UK,  European Union and Australia, has led and may in the  future lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations that  could limit companies in those countries from outsourcing  work to us, or could inhibit our ability to staff client  projects in a timely manner thereby impacting our revenue  and profitability .
• Given that a large number of our employees in the US,  UK, European Union and other jurisdictions are working  on visas, any restrictions on immigration may affect our  ability to compete for and provide services to clients in  these jurisdictions, which could hamper our growth or  cause our revenues to decline and impact profitability .
• New and changing corporate governance and public  disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance  policies and increase our costs of compliance.

Management’s discussion and analysis | 101  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 • Indian laws limit our ability to raise capital outside India  and may limit the ability of others to acquire us, which  could prevent us from operating our business or entering  into a transaction that is in the best interests of our  shareholders.
• Historically , our ADSs have traded at a significant premium  to the trading prices of our underlying equity shares.
Currently , they do not do so and they may not continue  to do so in the future.
• Sales of our equity shares may adversely affect the prices  of our equity shares and ADSs.
• The price of our ADSs and the US dollar value of any  dividends we declare may be negatively affected by  fluctuations in the US dollar to Indian rupee exchange rate.

• An investor in our ADSs may not be able to exercise  pre-emptive rights for additional shares and may thereby  suffer dilution of such investor’s equity interest in us.
• ADS holders may be restricted in their ability to exercise  voting rights.

• If the Government of India modifies dividend distribution  tax rates or introduces new forms of taxes on distribution  of profits or changes the basis of application of these  taxes, the same could materially affect the returns to our  shareholders.

We enhanced our  technology-led training efforts in multiple areas.
As part of our Foundation Program, we enhanced some of  the existing courses and introduced new courses on Infosys  Learning Platform (ILP).
ILP was launched in the previous  year, and we started reaping benefits in the form of enhanced  learning among our fresh hires.
Our continuous education programs emphasize enhancing  the relevance and effectiveness of learning.
This year, we have  enhanced hands-on-based assessments, and many courses  have been launched on ILP for our existing employees, which  resulted in enhanced reach of our enablement programs  across the organization.

102 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Corporate governance report Our corporate governance philosophy Our corporate governance is a reflection of our value system encompassing our culture, policies, and relationships with our  stakeholders.
Integrity and transparency are key to our corporate governance practices to ensure that we gain and retain the  trust of our stakeholders at all times.
Corporate governance framework Our corporate governance framework is guided by our core values – Client Value, Leadership by Example, Integrity and  Transparency , Fairness and Excellence (C-LIFE) – and is based on the following principles : CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT INFOSYS governance structure Integrity and transparency Legal com pliance stakeholders Relationship with Fairness and excellence Effective corporate Responsible leadership The Board as trustee Ensure transparency and maintain a high level of integrity Satisfy both the spirit and the letter of the law in all our actions and disclosures Communicate frequently with stakeholders, including clients, investors, shareholders and stock markets Be objective and ethical, and deliver the best to earn trust and respect from our stakeholders Build simple and transparent processes driven by business needs of all stakeholders Lead by example by  ensuring independence of the Board and effectiveness of the Management  Safeguard the shareholder’s capital as trustee, and not as its owner We believe that an active, well-informed and independent  board is necessary to ensure the highest standards of  corporate governance.
At Infosys, the Board is at the core of  our corporate governance practice.
The Board oversees the  Management’s functions and protects the long-term interests  of our stakeholders.
As on March 31, 2018, the Board comprised nine members,  of which six members are independent directors and one  member is a non-executive, non-independent director.
The  non-executive, non-independent director is the Chairman  of the Board.
An independent director is the chairperson  of each of the Board committees, namely audit, nomination  and remuneration, stakeholders relationship, risk and  strategy , finance and investment and corporate social  responsibility (CSR) committees.
Our corporate governance framework ensures that we make  timely disclosures and share accurate information regarding  our financials and performance, as well as disclosures related  to the leadership and governance of the Company .
Compliance with global guidelines and  standards Infosys has been a front-runner in complying with global best  practices in corporate governance.
Starting with the landmark  Cadbury Report in the UK in 1992, the enactment of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, and the Consumer Protection Act,  we have been following and complying with the best practices  of corporate governance over the years.
Corporate governance report | 103  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 SEBI has notified the Listing Regulations on September 2,  2015.
The Listing Regulations have incorporated the  principles for corporate governance in line with the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) principles.
The Listing Regulations also provide  broad principles for periodic disclosures by listed entities  in line with the International Organization of Securities  Commissions (IOSCO) principles.
We are in compliance with  all the applicable requirements of the Listing Regulations.
SEBI had constituted a committee on June 2, 2017, under the  Chairmanship of Uday Kotak, to address corporate governance  gaps and to enhance long-term standards necessary to shape a  strong and resilient governance apparatus for listed companies  in India.
SEBI, at its board meeting held on March 28, 2018,  accepted several recommendations of the Kotak Committee  with and without modifications along with timelines  for implementation.
We substantially comply with the  recommendations of the Kotak Committee accepted by SEBI.
During the year, the Company was rated in the leadership  category in a corporate governance study conducted jointly  by BSE Limited (BSE) and the International Finance Corp  (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, and Institutional  Investors Advisory Services (IiAS), based on G20 / OECD  principles which are globally accepted benchmarks for  corporate governance.
We substantially comply with the Euroshareholders Corporate  Governance Guidelines, 2000 and the recommendations of  the Conference Board Commission on Public Trusts and  Private Enterprises in the US.
We also adhere to the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the OECD principles.
Corporate governance guidelines The Board has defined a set of corporate governance best  practices and guidelines to help fulfill our corporate  responsibility towards our stakeholders.
These guidelines  ensure that the Board will have the necessary authority and  processes to review and evaluate our operations as and when  required.
Further, these guidelines allow the Board to make  decisions that are independent of the Management.
The Board  may change these guidelines regularly to achieve our stated  objectives.
The guidelines can be accessed from our website,  at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/ Documents/corporate-governance-guidelines.pdf  A.
Board composition Size and composition of the Board We believe that our Board needs to have an appropriate mix of executive, non-executive and independent directors to maintain its  independence, and separate its functions of governance and management.
Listing Regulations mandate that for a company with  a non-executive chairman, who is a promoter, at least half of the Board should be independent directors.
As on March 31, 2018,  our Board comprised nine members, consisting of one non-executive, non-independent Chairman, two executive directors,  and six independent directors.
Independent directors constitute 67% of the Board’s strength – more than the requirements of  the Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing Regulations.
Three out of nine members are women, making up 33% of the Board’s  strength.
The Board periodically evaluates the need for change in its size and composition.

The current law in India mandates that two-third of the  non-independent directors be liable to retire by rotation every  year, and one-third of them mandatorily retire by rotation, and  qualifies the retiring members for reappointment.
Executive  directors are appointed by the shareholders for a maximum  period of five years, but are eligible for reappointment upon  completion of their term.

Board member evaluation One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review  the Board evaluation framework.
The Board works with the  nomination and remuneration committee to lay down the  evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the  Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive /  independent directors through a peer evaluation, excluding  the director being evaluated.
Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control  and guidance.
Some of the performance indicators, based on  which the independent directors, are evaluated include : • The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate  governance practices • The ability to contribute by introducing international best  practices to address business challenges and risks • Active participation in long-term strategic planning • Commitment to the fulfillment of a director’s obligations  and fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation  in Board and committee meetings.
To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees,  as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous  Board review is internally undertaken on an annual basis.
The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory  firm on board matters, to conduct Board evaluation for fiscal  2018.
The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics and  softer aspects.
The process involved independent discussions  with all Board members.
The Board evaluation was completed for fiscal 2018, and the  summary of findings and recommendations was discussed on  April 12 and 13, 2018.
Succession planning The nomination and remuneration committee works with the  Board on the leadership succession plan to ensure orderly  succession in appointments to the Board and in the senior  management.
The Company strives to maintain an appropriate  balance of skills and experience within the organization and  the Board in an endeavor to introduce new perspectives while  maintaining experience and continuity .
By integrating workforce planning with strategic business  planning, the Company puts the necessary financial and  human resources in place so that its objectives can be met.
Our Board includes nine directors with broad and diverse  skills and viewpoints to aid the Company in advancing its  strategy .
In addition, promoting senior management within  the organization fuels the ambitions of the talent force to earn  future leadership roles.
Board and executive leadership compensation  policy In order to adapt to the changing business context and  the highly competitive environment that we operate in,  our executive compensation philosophy has evolved to  reward long-term sustainable performance.
Our Executive  Compensation Policy moves away from a predominantly  cash-based compensation structure to a total rewards  structure where a significant portion of the rewards is in the  form of stock incentives.
The nomination and remuneration committee determines  and recommends to the Board the compensation payable  to directors.
All Board-level compensation is approved by  the shareholders and disclosed separately in the financial  statements.
Remuneration for the executive directors  comprises a fixed component and a variable component,  including stock incentives.
The committee makes a periodic  appraisal of the performance of the executive directors based  on a detailed performance matrix.
The annual compensation  of the executive directors is approved by the committee  and placed before the shareholders at the shareholders’  meeting / postal ballot.
108 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 The executive directors of the Company are entitled to an  annual / half-yearly variable pay , including stock incentives,  which is subject to the achievement of certain periodic  milestones by the Company , as determined by the Board.

In March 1999, we issued 20,70,000 American Depositary  Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares of par  value ` 10 each) at US$ 34 per ADS under the ADS Program,  and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.
The above data is unadjusted for stock split and bonus  shares.
In July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, we  issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary Receipts  (ADRs) of US$ 294 million, US$ 1.1 billion and US$ 1.6  billion respectively .
During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed  from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark  the transition from being a technology services provider to a  business transformation partner to our clients.
During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ,  and listed them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),  Euronext London and Euronext Paris.
In March 2018, the  Company announced its intention to voluntarily delist its  ADSs (ISIN US4567881085) from the Euronext Paris and  Euronext London exchanges.
The primary reason for seeking  the proposed delisting is the low average daily trading  volume of Infosys ADSs on these exchanges, which is not  commensurate with the related administrative requirements.
During the five-year period of the Company’s listing on  Euronext Paris and Euronext London, the average daily  trading volume of the Company’s ADSs was significantly  lower than its average daily trading volume on the NYSE.
The  proposed delisting is subject to approval from Euronext Paris  S.A. and Euronext London Limited.
There will be no change  in the Infosys share / ADS count, capital structure and float as  a result of the proposed delisting from the above exchanges.
Infosys ADSs will continue to be listed on the NYSE under  the symbol ‘INFY’ and investors can continue to trade their  ADSs on the NYSE as before.
Subject to the approval of the proposed delisting by Euronext  Paris S.A. and Euronext London Limited, a sale facility will  be provided by the Company to the holders of ADSs trading  on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges.
ADS holders who opt for it will be able to sell their ADSs on  the NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext  London rules.
ADS holders who do not opt for it can continue  to retain their ADSs and will be able to trade their ADSs on the  NYSE.
Further, until the date of completion of the proposed  delisting, the ADS holders can continue to trade their ADSs  on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges.

134 | Risk management report Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Risk management report The risk management report discusses various dimensions of our enterprise risk management function.
The risk-related  information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive.
The discussion may contain statements that are forward-looking  in nature.
Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the  forward-looking statements.
If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially  and adversely affected.
Our business, operating results, financial performance or prospects could also be harmed by risks and  uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.
Readers are advised to refer to the  detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings, and exercise their own judgment in assessing  risks associated with the Company .
A. Overview The Infosys Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) enables the  achievement of strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing,  assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk  or potential threat to these objectives.
While achievement  of strategic objectives is the key driver, our values, culture,  obligation and commitment to employees, customers,  investors, regulatory bodies, partners and the community  around us are the foundation on which our ERM framework is  developed.
Systematic and proactive identification of risks and  mitigation thereof enable effective or quick decision-making  and boosts the performance of the organization.
The ERM  unit functions as a decision-enabler which not only seeks to  minimize the impact of risks but also enables effective resource  allocation based on the risk impact ranking and risk appetite.
Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of  risks based on secondary risks and residual risks.
Our ERM framework encompasses all the risks that the  organization is facing under different categories such as  strategic, operational, and legal and compliance risks.
Any  of these categories can have internal or external dimensions.
Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these  risks proactively .
We take cognizance of risks faced by our  key stakeholders and the multiplied impact of the same while  framing our risk responses.
B.
Key components of Infosys Enterprise Risk Management program Framework : We adopted a new integrated ERM framework that is being implemented across the organization by the risk  management office.

Risk management report | 137  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 C. RISC360 integrated risk and auditing platform RISC360 is a common Governance, Risk management  and Compliance (GRC) platform that combines three  lines of defense under one umbrella to enable risk-based  decision- making and auditing.
The iGRC platform gives a  consolidated risk and strategic goal view to the leadership to  enable quick and effective decision-making across enterprise  risk, internal audit, Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance  and corporate audit.
Integration of these functions using one  common platform ensures that audits are based on risks tied  to the overall ERM framework and the organization gets the  benefits of synergies amongst different lines of defense.

A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to  the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material  respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over  financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2018, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria  established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Overview 1 .1 Company overview  Infosys Limited (‘the Company’ or Infosys) is a leading provider  of consulting, technology , outsourcing, next-generation  services and software.
Along with its subsidiaries, Infosys  provides business IT services (comprising application  development and maintenance, independent validation,  infrastructure management, engineering services comprising  product engineering and life-cycle solutions and business  process management); consulting and systems integration  services (comprising consulting, enterprise solutions,  systems integration and advanced technologies); products,  business platforms and solutions to accelerate intellectual  property-led innovation.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India and has its registered office in Bengaluru,  Karnataka, India.
The Company has its primary listings on the  BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited,  in India.
The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs)  representing equity shares are also listed on the New York  Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris.
The Company has proposed to voluntarily delist its ADSs  from the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges due  to low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADSs on these  exchanges.
The proposed delisting is subject to approval from  the said stock exchanges.
The financial statements are approved for issue by the  Company’s Board of Directors on April 13, 2018.
1 .2 Basis of preparation of financial statements  These financial statements are prepared in accordance with  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), under the historical  cost convention on the accrual basis except for certain  financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the  provisions of the Companies Act , 2013 (‘the Act’) (to the  extent notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and  Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
The Ind AS are prescribed  under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and  the relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Effective April 1, 2016, the Company has adopted all the Ind AS  standards and the adoption was carried out in accordance  with Ind AS 101, First‑time Adoption of Indian Accounting  Standards, with April 1, 2015 as the transition date.
The  transition was carried out from Indian Accounting Principles  generally accepted in India as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules,  2014 (IGAAP), which was the previous GAAP .
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except  where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted  or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a  change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
Amounts for the year ended March 31, 2017 and as at March 31,  2017 were audited by previous auditors – B S R & Co LLP .
As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded  to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous  quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures  reported in this statement.
1 .3 Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the financial statements in conformity  with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates,  judgments and assumptions.
These estimates, judgments and  assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  during the period.
The application of accounting policies  that require critical accounting estimates involving complex  and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in  these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.4.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate  changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes  aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements  in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their  effects are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
1 .4 Critical accounting estimates  a.
Revenue recognition  The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in  accounting for its fixed-price contracts.
Use of the percentage- of-completion method requires the Company to estimate the  efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the total  efforts or costs to be expended.
Efforts or costs expended  have been used to measure progress towards completion as  there is a direct relationship between input and productivity .
Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted  contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses  become probable based on the expected contract estimates  at the reporting date.
b.
Income taxes  The Company’s two major tax jurisdictions are India and  the US, though the Company also files tax returns in other  overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved  in determining the provision for income taxes, including  amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax  positions.
Also, refer to Notes 2.15 and 2.22. c. Property, plant and equipment  Property , plant and equipment represent a significant  proportion of the asset base of the Company .
The charge in  respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining  an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected  residual value at the end of its life.
The useful lives and  residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the  Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed  Notes to the Financial Statements  154 | Standalone financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 periodically , including at each financial year end.
The lives  are based on historical experience with similar assets as well  as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life,  such as changes in technology .
d. Non-current assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying  amount or fair value less costs to sell.
The determination of fair  value less costs to sell includes use of management estimates  and assumptions.
The fair value of the asset held for sale has  been estimated using valuation techniques (mainly income  and market approach), which include unobservable inputs.
1 .5 Recent accounting pronouncements  Appendix B to Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions and  advance consideration : On March 28, 2018, the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs (‘the MCA ’) notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2018 containing  Appendix B to Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions  and advance consideration which clarifies the date of the  transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange  rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense  or income, when an entity has received or paid advance  consideration in a foreign currency .
The amendment will come into force from April 1, 2018.
The Company has evaluated the effect of this on the financial  statements and the impact is not material.
Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers : On  March 28, 2018, the MCA notified the Ind AS 115.
The core  principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize  revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services  to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration  to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for  those goods or services.
Further, the new standard requires  enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and  uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s  contracts with customers.
The standard permits two possible methods of transition : • Retrospective approach - Under this approach the standard  will be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting  period presented in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting  Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
• Retrospectively with cumulative effect of initially applying  the standard recognized at the date of initial application  (Cumulative catch - up approach) The effective date for adoption of Ind AS 115 is financial  period beginning on or after April 1, 2018.
The Company will adopt the standard on April 1, 2018  by using the cumulative catch-up transition method and  accordingly , comparatives for the year ending or ended  March 31, 2018 will not be retrospectively adjusted.
The effect  on adoption of Ind AS 115 is expected to be insignificant.
2.1 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property , plant and equipment are stated at cost, less  accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any .
Costs  directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the  property , plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended  by the Management.
The Company depreciates property ,  plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using  the straight-line method.
The estimated useful lives of  assets are as follows : Building(1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles(1) 5 years Leasehold improvements Over lease term (1)  Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the  useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the  Management expects to use these assets.
Hence, the useful lives for these  assets are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of  Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are  reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property , plant and  equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified  as capital advances under other non-current assets and the  cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed  under ‘Capital work-in-progress’.
Subsequent expenditures  relating to property , plant and equipment are capitalized only  when it is probable that future economic benefits associated  with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably .
Repairs and maintenance costs are  recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated  from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the  asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the  Statement of Profit and Loss.
Impairment Property , plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For the  purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount  (i.e.
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the  value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis  unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the  recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating  Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment  to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is  measured by the amount by which the carrying value of  the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the  asset.
An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of  Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates  used to determine the recoverable amount.
The carrying  amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable  amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined (net of  any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been  recognized for the asset in prior years.

2.9 Financial instruments Accounting policy 2.9.1 Initial recognition The Company recognizes financial assets and financial  liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the instrument.
All financial assets and liabilities  are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for  trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction  price.
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the  acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities,  which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added  to the fair value on initial recognition.
Regular way purchase  and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.
2.9.2 Subsequent measurement a. Non-derivative financial instruments (i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if  it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold  the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the  contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified  dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other     comprehensive income A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if it is held within a  business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the  contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified  dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The Company  has made an irrevocable election for its investments which  are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent  changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based  on its business model.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset, which is not classified in any of the above  categories, is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost  using the effective interest method, except for contingent  consideration recognized in a business combination, which  is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from  the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair  value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
(v) Investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate  financial statements.
b.
Derivative financial instruments  The Company holds derivative financial instruments such  as foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign  currency exposures.
The counterparty for these contracts  is generally a bank.
(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value     thr ough profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities  which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Company believes that these derivatives  constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may  not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial  Instruments.
Any derivative that is either not designated as  hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109,  is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability , at fair  value through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially  at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized  in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when  incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives  are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the  resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other  income.
Assets/ liabilities in this category are presented as  current assets/current liabilities if they are either held for  trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after  the Balance Sheet date.
(ii) Cash flow hedge The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward  and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the  risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable  forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging  instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value  of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income  and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.
Any  ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative  is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement  of Profit and Loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets  the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively .
If the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss  Standalone financial statements | 167  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging  reserve till the period the hedge was effective, remains in  cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction  occurs.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in  the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit  in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of  the related forecasted transaction.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur,  then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is  reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
c. Share capital Ordinary shares  Ordinary shares are classified as equity .
Incremental costs  directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares and  share options and buy back of ordinary shares are recognized  as a deduction from equity , net of any tax effects.
2.9.3 Derecognition of financial instruments The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset  expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer  qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109.
A financial  liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from  the Company’s Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in  the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.9.4 Fair value of financial instruments In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the  Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that  are based on market conditions and risks existing at each  reporting date.
The methods used to determine fair value  include discounted cash flow analysis, available quoted  market prices and dealer quotes.
All methods of assessing  fair value result in general approximation of value, and such  value may never actually be realized.
Refer to ‘Financial instruments by category’ for the disclosure  on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and  liabilities.
For financial assets and liabilities maturing within  one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not  carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair  value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
2.9.5 Impairment  The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected  credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are  not fair valued through profit or loss.
Loss allowance for  trade receivables with no significant financing component is  measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For all other  financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an  amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a  significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in  which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.
The amount  of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust  the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that  is required to be recognized, is recognized as an impairment  gain or loss in the statement of profit or loss.

The related hedge transactions for  balance in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2018 are  expected to occur and reclassified to the Statement of Profit  or Loss within three months.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge  relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness  assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists  between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including  whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes  in cash flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer  optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged  and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting,  the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either  the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the  hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used  for risk management purposes.

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the  Management considers whether some portion or all of the  deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate  realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon  the generation of future taxable income during the periods  in which the temporary differences become deductible.
The  Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred  income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and  tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on  the level of historical taxable income and projections for  future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred  income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes  that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible  differences.
The amount of the deferred income tax assets  considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near  term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry  forward period are reduced.
The gross movement in the deferred income tax account  for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31,  2017, is as follows :  in ` crore Particulars As at March 31, 2018 2017 Net deferred income tax asset  at the beginning  346 405 Additions on account of  business transfer   (Refer to Note 2.3.1)  13  –  Translation differences  1  6  Credits / (charge) relating to  temporary differences  250  (52) Temporary differences on  other comprehensive income  13  (13) Net deferred income tax asset  at the end 623  346 The entire deferred income tax, except for a credit of ` 155  crore (on account of US tax reforms explained above), for the  year ended March 31, 2018, relates to origination and reversal  of temporary differences  The credit relating to temporary differences during the year  ended March 31, 2018 is primarily on account of property ,  plant and equipment and trade receivables partially offset by  decrease in compensated absences and accrued compensation  to employees.

2.16  Revenue from operations Accounting policy The Company derives revenues primarily from software  development and related services and from the licensing  of software products.
Arrangements with customers for  software-related services are mainly either on a fixed-price,  fixed-timeframe or on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as  the related services are performed and revenue from the end  of the last billing to the Balance Sheet date is recognized as  unbilled revenues.
Revenue from fixed-price, fixed-timeframe  contracts, where there is no uncertainty as to measurement  or collectability of consideration, is recognized as per the  percentage-of-completion method.
When there is uncertainty  as to measurement or ultimate collectability , revenue  recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress  towards completion as there is a direct relationship between  input and productivity .
Provisions for estimated losses, if  any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period  in which such losses become probable based on the current  contract estimates.
Costs and earnings in excess of billings are  classified as unbilled revenues while billings in excess of costs  and earnings are classified as unearned revenues.
Deferred  contract costs are amortized over the term of the contract.
Maintenance revenue is recognized rateably over the term of  the underlying maintenance arrangement.
Standalone financial statements | 181  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 In arrangements for software development and related  services and maintenance services, the Company has applied  the guidance in Ind AS 18, Revenue, by applying the revenue  recognition criteria for each separately identifiable component  of a single transaction.
The arrangements generally meet the  criteria for considering software development and related  services as separately identifiable components.
For allocating  the consideration, the Company has measured the revenue  in respect of each separable component of a transaction at its  fair value, in accordance with principles given in Ind AS 18.
The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold  separately is the best evidence of its fair value.
In cases where  the Company is unable to establish objective and reliable  evidence of fair value for the software development and  related services, the Company has used a residual method  to allocate the arrangement consideration.
In these cases,  the balance of the consideration, after allocating the fair  values of undelivered components of a transaction, has been  allocated to the delivered components for which specific fair  values do not exist.
License fee revenues are recognized when the general revenue  recognition criteria given in Ind AS 18 are met.
Arrangements  to deliver software products generally have three elements :  license, implementation and Annual Technical Services  (ATS).
The Company has applied the principles given in Ind  AS 18 to account for revenues from these multiple element  arrangements.
Objective and reliable evidence of fair value  has been established for ATS.
Objective and reliable evidence  of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold  separately .
When other services are provided in conjunction  with the licensing arrangement and objective and reliable  evidence of their fair values have been established, the revenue  from such contracts are allocated to each component of the  contract in a manner, whereby revenue is deferred for the  undelivered services and the residual amounts are recognized  as revenue for delivered elements.
In the absence of objective  and reliable evidence of fair value for implementation, the  entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is  recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the  implementation is performed.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software  products is recognized as the services are performed.
ATS  revenue is recognized rateably over the period in which the  services are rendered.
Advances received for services and products are reported  as client deposits until all conditions for revenue  recognition are met.
The Company accounts for volume discounts and pricing  incentives to customers as a reduction of revenue based on  the rateable allocation of the discounts / incentives amount  to each of the underlying revenue transaction that results  in progress by the customer towards earning the discount  / incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increases in levels of revenue transactions, the Company  recognizes the liability based on its estimate of the customer’s  future purchases.
If it is probable that the criteria for the  discount will not be met, or if the amount thereof cannot  be estimated reliably , then discount is not recognized until  the payment is probable and the amount can be estimated  reliably .
The Company recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts in the period in which the  change occurs.
The discounts are passed on to the customer  either as direct payments or as a reduction of payments  due from the customer.

2.21  Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares  used in computing earning per share Accounting policy Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the  net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during the period.
Diluted earnings per equity share is  computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity  holders of the Company by the weighted average number  of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings  per equity share and also the weighted average number of  equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion  of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The dilutive potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had  the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e.
the  average market value of the outstanding equity shares).
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at  the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity  shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for  any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes  effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by  the Board of Directors.
A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation  of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows : Particulars Year ended March 31, 2018 2017 Basic earnings  per equity share –  weighted average  number of equity  shares outstanding 226,63,43,802 229,69,44,664 Effect of dilutive  common equivalent  shares – share options  outstanding 10,48,819 2,15,006 Diluted earnings  per equity share –  weighted average  number of equity  shares and common  equivalent shares  outstanding226,73,92,621 229,71,59,670 For the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017  number of options to purchase equity shares that had an  anti-dilutive effect are 27,876 and 77,942 respectively .

These matters are pending before various appellate authorities and the  186 | Standalone financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Management including its tax advisors expect that its position will likely  be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse  effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.
Income tax claims amounting to ` 4,670 crore had not been considered  as claims not acknowledged as debt because the Company has received  favorable decisions on similar claims and therefore, based on its  assessment, is of the view that any liability resulting from these claims  is remote and will not sustain on ultimate resolution.
Amount paid to statutory authorities against the above tax claims  amounted to ` 6,475 crore.
(2) Uncalled capital pertaining to investments The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims,  which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.

On purposes other than (1) above  142  –  142 2.25  Segment reporting Ind AS 108 establishes standards for the way that public  business enterprises report information about operating  segments and related disclosures about products and services,  geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company’s  operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end  business solutions to enable clients to enhance business  performance.
Based on the ‘management approach’ as  defined in Ind AS 108, the Chief Operating Decision Maker  (CODM) evaluates the Company’s performance and allocates  resources based on an analysis of various performance  indicators by business segments and geographic segments.
Accordingly , the information has been presented both along  business segments and geographic segments.
The accounting  principles used in the preparation of the financial statements  are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure  in individual segments, and are as set out in the significant  accounting policies.
Business segments of the Company are primarily enterprises  in Financial Services (FS), enterprises in Manufacturing  (MFG), enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods  and Logistics (RCL), enterprises in the Energy & utilities,  Communication and Services (ECS), enterprises in Hi-tech  (Hi-Tech), enterprises in Life Sciences, Healthcare and  Insurance (HILIFE) and all other segments.
The FS reportable  segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services  operating segment and the Finacle operating segment because  of the similarity of the economic characteristics.
All other  Standalone financial statements | 191  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 segments represents the operating segments of businesses  in India, Japan and China.
Geographic segmentation is  based on business sourced from that geographic region and  delivered from both on site and off shore locations.
North  America comprises the United States of America, Canada  and Mexico, Europe includes continental Europe (both the  east and the west), Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the  Rest of the World comprising all other places except those  mentioned above and India.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to  segments are categorized based on items that are individually  identifiable to that segment.
Revenue for ‘all other segments’  represents revenue generated from customers located in India,  Japan and China.
Allocated expenses of segments include  expenses incurred for rendering services from the Company’s  offshore software development centres and on-site expenses,  which are categorized in relation to the associated turnover  of the segment.
Certain expenses such as depreciation, which  form a significant component of total expenses, are not  specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying  assets are used interchangeably .
The Management believes that  it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to  those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are  separately disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the  total income of the Company .
Assets and liabilities used in the Company’s business are not  identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are  used interchangeably between segments.
The Management  believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment  disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a  meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.
Geographical information on revenue and business segment  revenue information is collated based on individual  customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is  otherwise recognized.

2.26  Assets held for sale Accounting policy Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified  under held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to  be recovered principally through sale rather than through  continuing use.
The condition for classification of held  for sale is met when the non-current asset or the disposal  group is available for immediate sale and the same is highly  probable of being completed within one year from the date  of classification under held for sale.
Non-current assets and  disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of  carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
In the quarter ended March 2018, on conclusion of a  strategic review of the portfolio businesses, the Company  initiated identification and evaluation of potential buyers for  its subsidiaries, Kallidus and Skava (together referred to as  ‘Skava’) and Panaya.
The Company anticipates completion  of the sale by March 2019 and accordingly , investments  amounting to ` 1,525 crore in respect of these subsidiaries  have been reclassified under ‘assets held for sale’.
On  reclassification, these investments has been measured at the  lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and  consequently , an impairment loss of ` 589 crore in respect of  Panaya has been recognized in the standalone profit and loss  for the year ended March 31, 2018.

Ramesh Partner (Membership number : 70928) Annexure A to the Independent Auditors’ Report (Referred to in paragraph (f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members  of Infosys Limited of even date) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of sub-section 3  of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31,  2018, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as  ‘the Company’) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Board of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are  responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting  criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (‘the ICAI’).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  Consolidated financial statements | 197  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the  respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its  subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance  with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the Guidance Note’) issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies  Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that  we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system  over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion  on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are  companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors  of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion  or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to  the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary  companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls  system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as  at March 31, 2018, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective companies  considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls  Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Manikantha Company Secretary 204 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Accounting policy Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of  a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or  expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities  of the Company are segregated.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known  amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.
Amendment to Ind AS 7 Effective April 1, 2017, the Group adopted the amendment to Ind AS 7, which requires the entities to provide disclosures that  enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes  arising from cash flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances  in the Balance Sheet for liabilities arising from financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement.
The adoption of the  amendment did not have any material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Manikantha Company Secretary 206 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Overview and notes to the consolidated financial statements  1 .
Overview 1 .1 Company overview  Infosys Limited (‘the Company’ or Infosys) is a leading provider  of consulting, technology , outsourcing and next-generation  services and software.
Along with its subsidiaries, Infosys  provides business IT services (comprising application  development and maintenance, independent validation,  infrastructure management, engineering services comprising  product engineering and life cycle solutions and business  process management); consulting and systems integration  services (comprising consulting, enterprise solutions,  systems integration and advanced technologies); products,  business platforms and solutions to accelerate intellectual  property-led innovation.
Its new offerings span areas like  digital, big data and analytics, cloud, data and mainframe  modernization, cyber security , IoT engineering services and  API and micro services.
Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is  hereinafter referred to as ‘the Group’.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India and has its registered office at Bengaluru,  Karnataka, India.
The Company has its primary listings on the  BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited  in India.
The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs)  representing equity shares are also listed on the New York  Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris.
The Company has proposed to voluntarily delist its ADS  from the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges  due to low average daily trading volume of its ADS on these  exchanges.
The proposed delisting is subject to approval from  the said stock exchanges.
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are approved for  issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 13, 2018.
1 .2 Basis of preparation of financial statements  These consolidated financial statements are prepared in  accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS),  under the historical cost convention on the accrual basis  except for certain financial instruments which are measured  at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013  (‘the Act’) (to the extent notified) and guidelines issued by the  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
The Ind AS  are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3  of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015  and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Effective April 1, 2016, the Group has adopted all the Ind  AS standards and the adoption was carried out in accordance  with Ind AS 101, First‑time adoption of Indian Accounting  Standards, with April 1, 2015 as the transition date.
The  transition was carried out from Indian Accounting Principles  generally accepted in India as prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules,  2014 (IGAAP), which was the previous GAAP .
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except  where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted  or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a  change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.
Amounts for the years ended March 31, 2017 and as at March 31,  2017 were audited by previous auditors – B S R & Co LLP .
As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded  to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous  quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures  reported in this statement.
1 .3 Basis of consolidation  Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls.
The  consolidated financial statements comprise the financial  statements of the Company , its controlled trusts, its  subsidiaries and associate, as disclosed in Note 2.23.
Control  exists when the parent has power over the entity , is exposed,  or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the  entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its  power over the entity .
Power is demonstrated through existing  rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those  which significantly affect the entity’s returns.
Subsidiaries  are consolidated from the date control commences until the  date control ceases.
The financial statements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group  balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss  from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.
These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform  accounting policies in use at the Group.
Non-controlling  interests, which represent part of the net profit or loss and  net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly ,  owned or controlled by the Company , are excluded.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant  influence but not control.
Investments in associates are  accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The  investment is initially recognized at cost, and the carrying  amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor’s  share of the profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition  date.
The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill  identified on acquisition.
1 .4 Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of the financial statements in conformity  with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates,  judgments and assumptions.
These estimates, judgments and  assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  during the period.
Application of accounting policies that  require critical accounting estimates involving complex  and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in  these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5.
Accounting estimates could change from period to period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Appropriate  changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes  aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  Consolidated financial statements | 207  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements  in the period in which changes are made and, if material,  their effects are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated  financial statements.
1 .5 Critical accounting estimates  a.
Revenue recognition  The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method  in accounting for its fixed-price contracts.
The use of the  percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to  estimate the efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion  of the total efforts or costs to be expended.
Efforts or costs  expended have been used to measure progress towards  completion as there is a direct relationship between input  and productivity .
Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on  uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which  such losses become probable, based on the expected contract  estimates at the reporting date.
b.
Income taxes  The Company’s two major tax jurisdictions are India and  the US, though the Company also files tax returns in other  overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved  in determining the provision for income taxes, including  amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax  positions.
Also, refer to Notes 2.15 and 2.22. c. Business combinations and intangible assets Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103,  Business Combinations.
Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable  intangible assets and contingent consideration to be fair valued  in order to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Significant  estimates are required to be made in determining the value  of contingent consideration and intangible assets.
These  valuations are conducted by independent valuation experts.
d. Property, plant and equipment  Property , plant and equipment represent a significant  proportion of the asset base of the Group.
The charge in  respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining  an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected  residual value at the end of its life.
The useful lives and  residual values of the Group’s assets are determined by the  Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed  periodically , including at each financial year end.
The lives  are based on historical experience with similar assets as well  as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life,  such as changes in technology .
e. Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and  whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of  a cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount  based on a number of factors including operating results,  business plans, future cash flows and economic conditions.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on  the higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell.
The  goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of the CGU  or groups of CGUs which are benefiting from the synergies of  the acquisition, and which represent the lowest level at which  goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Market-related information and estimates are used to  determine the recoverable amount.
Key assumptions on  which the Management has based its determination of  recoverable amount include estimated long -term growth  rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating  margins.
The cash flow projections take into account past  experience and represent the Management’s best estimate  about future developments.
f. Non-current assets and disposal group held for sale Assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are  measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value  less cost to sell.
The determination of fair value less costs to  sell includes use of management estimates and assumptions.
The fair value of the disposal groups has been estimated  using valuation techniques (including income and market  approach) which includes unobservable inputs.
1 .6 Recent accounting pronouncements  Appendix B to Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions and  advance consideration : On March 28, 2018, the Ministry of  Corporate Affairs (MCA) has notified the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2018 containing  Appendix B to Ind AS 21, Foreign currency transactions  and advance consideration, which clarifies the date of the  transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange  rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense  or income, when an entity has received or paid advance  consideration in a foreign currency .
This amendment will come into force from April 1, 2018.
The Group has evaluated the effect of this on the consolidated  financial statements and the impact is not material.
Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers :  On  March  28, 2018, the MCA has notified the Ind AS 115,  Revenue from Contract with Customers .
The core principle  of the new standard is that an entity should recognize  revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services  to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration  to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for  those goods or services.
Further, the new standard requires  enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and  uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s  contracts with customers.
The standard permits two possible methods of transition : • Retrospective approach – Under this approach the standard  will be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting  period presented in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting  Policies, Changes in Accounting.
Estimates and Errors  • Retrospectively with cumulative effect of initially applying  the standard recognized at the date of initial application  (Cumulative catch-up approach) The effective date for adoption of Ind AS 115 is financial  periods beginning on or after April 1, 2018.
The Group will adopt the standard on April 1, 2018 by using  the cumulative catch-up transition method and accordingly ,  comparatives for the year ending or ended March 31, 2018  208 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 will not be retrospectively adjusted.
The effect on adoption  of Ind AS 115 is expected to be insignificant.
2.1 Business combinations  Accounting policy Business combinations have been accounted for using the  acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103,  Business Combinations.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the  assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities  incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the  date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The cost  of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent  consideration.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and  contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are  measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Business combinations between entities under common  control is accounted for at carrying value.

The fair value of contingent consideration is determined by  discounting the estimated amount payable to the sellers of  Brilliant Basics on achievement of certain financial targets.
The key inputs used in determination of the fair value of  contingent consideration are the discount rate of 10% and the  probabilities of achievement of the financial targets.
The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair  value of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill.
The purchase price has been allocated based on the  Management’s estimates and independent appraisal of  fair values as follows : in ` crore Component Acquiree’s  carrying  amount Fair value  adjustments Purchase  price  allocated Net assets(1) 1 – 1 Intangible assets  – customer  relationships– 12  12  Deferred tax liabilities  on intangible assets–  (2)  (2) 1 10 11 Goodwill 35 Total purchase price   46 (1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of ` 2 crore Consolidated financial statements | 209  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 The goodwill is not tax-deductible.

2.2 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property , plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated  depreciation and impairment, if any .
Costs directly attributable  to acquisition are capitalized until the property , plant and  equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management.
The Group depreciates property , plant and equipment over  their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows : Buildings(1) 22-25 years Plant and machinery (1) 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years Vehicles(1) 5 years Leasehold improvements Over lease term (1)  Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the  useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the  Management expects to use these assets.
Hence, the useful lives for  these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C  of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are  reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property , plant and  equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified  as capital advances under other non-current assets and the  cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed  under ‘Capital work-in-progress’.
Subsequent expenditures  relating to property , plant and equipment is capitalized only  when it is probable that future economic benefits associated  with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably .
Repairs and maintenance costs are  recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss  when incurred.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation  are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or  retirement of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are  recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Impairment Property , plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For the  purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e.
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use)  is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset  does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of  those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount  is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment  to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value  of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of  the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in  the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised  recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not  exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment  loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

The aggregate depreciation has been included under  depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.3 Goodwill and other intangible assets 2.3.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill represents the cost of business acquisition  in excess of the Group’s interest in the net fair value of  identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the  acquiree.
When the net fair value of the identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the  cost of business acquisition, the bargain purchase excess is  recognized after reassesing the fair value of net assets acquired  in the capital reserve.
Goodwill is measured at cost less  accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and  whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be  impaired, relying on a number of factors including operating  results, business plans and future cash flows.
For the purpose  of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business  combination is allocated to the Group’s cash generating  units (CGU) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the  synergies arising from the business combination.
A CGU is  the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash  inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from  other assets or group of assets.
Impairment occurs when the  carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the  estimated recoverable amount of the CGU.
The recoverable  amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to  sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use is the present value of  future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU.
Total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce  the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU  and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the  basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An  impairment loss on goodwill is recognized in net profit in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and is not reversed  in the subsequent period.
A summary of changes in the carrying amount of  goodwill is as follows : in ` crore Particulars As at March 31, 2018 2017 Carrying value at the  beginning  3,652  3,764  Goodwill on Brilliant Basics  acquisition (Refer to Note 2.1) 35  –  Goodwill reclassified under  assets held for sale   (Refer to Note 2.25)  (1,609)  –  Translation differences  133  (112) Carrying value at the end  2,211  3,652  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in  a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups  of CGUs, which are benefited from the synergies of the  acquisition.
The chief operating decision maker reviews the  goodwill for any impairment at the operating segment level,  which is represented through groups of CGUs.
The goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments as  at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 as follows :  in ` crore  Segment As at March 31, 2018 2017 Financial services  474  826  Manufacturing  252  409  Retail, Consumer packaged  goods and Logistics  314  556  Life Sciences, Healthcare and  Insurance  446  638  Energy & Utilities,  Communication and Services  470  765   1,956  3,194  Operating segments without  significant goodwill 255  458  Total  2,211  3,652  212 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 The entire goodwill relating to Infosys BPM’s acquisition  of McCamish has been allocated to the groups of CGUs  which are represented by the Life Sciences, Healthcare  and Insurance segment.
The goodwill relating to Infosys BPM, Infosys Lodestone,  Portland, Panaya and Kallidus d.b.a Skava acquisitions  has been allocated to the groups of CGUs which are  represented by a majority of the entity’s operating segment  as at March 31, 2017.
The goodwill relating to Infosys BPM, Infosys Lodestone,  Portland and Brilliant Basics acquisitions has been allocated  to the groups of CGUs which are represented by a majority  of the entity’s operating segment as at March 31, 2018  (Refer to Note 2.25).
The entire goodwill relating to Noah acquisition has been  allocated to the group of CGUs which is represented by the  Energy & Utilities, Communication and Services segment.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair  value less cost to sell and its value-in-use.
The fair value of a  CGU is determined based on the market capitalization.
The  value-in-use is determined based on specific calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections over  a period of five years.
A range of each assumption used is  mentioned below.
As at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017,  the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded  its carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for the  calculations are as follows : (in %) Particulars As at March 31, 2018 2017 Long-term growth rate 8-10 8-10 Operating margins 17-20 17-20 Discount rate 13.5 14.4 The Management believes that any reasonable possible  changes in the key assumptions would not cause the  carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the  cash generating unit.
2.3.2 Other intangible assets Accounting policy Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated  amortization and impairment.
Intangible assets are amortized  over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a  straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for  use.
The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible  asset is based on a number of factors including the effects  of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic  factors (such as the stability of the industry , and known  technological advances).
Amortization methods and  useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each  financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Software product  development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical  and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated,  future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an  intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software  and the costs can be measured reliably .
The costs which can  be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labour,  overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the  asset for its intended use.
Impairment Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever  events or changes in circumstances indicate that their  carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
For the purpose  of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e.
the higher  of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is  determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does  not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those  from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is  determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment  to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value  of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of  the asset.
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in  the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised  recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not  exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment  loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

222 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 2.10 Financial instruments Accounting policy 2.10.1 Initial recognition The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities  when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the  instrument.
All financial assets and liabilities are recognized  at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables  which are initially measured at transaction price.
Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue  of financial assets and financial liabilities, that are not at fair  value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on  initial recognition.
Regular way purchase and sale of financial  assets are accounted for at trade date.
2.10.2 Subsequent measurement a.  Non-derivative financial instruments  (i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if  it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold  the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the  contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified  dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other     comprehensive income (FVOCI) A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value  through other comprehensive income if it is held within a  business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting  contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the  contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified  dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and  interest on the principal amount outstanding.
The Company  has made an irrevocable election for its investments which  are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent  changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based  on its business model.
(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above  categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost  using the effective interest method, except for contingent  consideration recognized in a business combination which  is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from  the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate  the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
b.
Derivative financial instruments The Group holds derivative financial instruments such  as foreign exchange forward and options contracts to  mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign  currency exposures.
The counterparty for these contracts  is generally a bank.
(i)  Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value    thr ough profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities  which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute  hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify  for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments.
Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or  is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS  109, is  categorized as a financial asset or financial liability , at fair  value through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially  at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized  in net profit in the consolidated Statement of Profit and  Loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these  derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss  and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in  other income.
Assets / liabilities in this category are presented  as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for  trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after  the Balance Sheet date.
(ii)  Cash flow hedge The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward  and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the  risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable  forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging  instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value  of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the  derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
If the hedging  instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively .
If the  hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,  the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument  recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the  hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until  the forecasted transaction occurs.
The cumulative gain or loss  previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is  transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of  Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted  transaction.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected  to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging  reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss.
c.  Share capital and treasury shares  (i) Ordinary shares  Ordinary shares are classified as equity .
Incremental costs  directly attributable to the issuance of new ordinary shares  and share options and buyback of ordinary shares are  recognized as a deduction from equity , net of any tax effects.
(ii)  Treasury shares  When any entity within the Group purchases the Company’s  ordinary shares, the consideration paid including any directly  attributable incremental cost, is presented as a deduction  Consolidated financial statements | 223  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 from total equity , until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently , the  amount received is recognized as an increase in equity , and the  resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred  to / from share premium.
2.10.3 Derecognition of financial instruments The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual  rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or  it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for  derecognition under Ind AS 109.
A financial liability (or a  part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group’s  Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract  is discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.10.4 Fair value of financial instruments In determining the fair value of its financial instruments,  the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that  are based on market conditions and risks existing at each  reporting date.
The methods used to determine fair value  include discounted cash flow analysis, available quoted  market prices and dealer quotes.
All methods of assessing  fair value result in general approximation of value, and such  value may never actually be realized.
Refer to table ‘Financial instruments by category’ below for the  disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets  and liabilities.
For financial assets and liabilities maturing  within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are  not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates  fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
2.10.5 Impairment  The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected  credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets which are  not fair valued through profit or loss.
Loss allowance for  trade receivables with no significant financing component is  measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For all other  financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an  amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a  significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in  which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.
The amount  of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust  the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that  is required to be recognized is recognized as an impairment  gain or loss in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have  a significant impact in its value.
The movement in contingent consideration as at March 31, 2018 from March 31, 2017 is mainly on account of settlement of  ` 45 crore pertaining to Kallidus acquisition and addition of ` 17 crore in relation to acquisition of Brilliant Basics Holdings  Limited (Refer to Note 2.3) 226 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 Financial risk management  Financial risk factors  The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks : market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s primary  focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial  performance.
The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments  to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual  characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers.
Market risk  The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently  the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases  from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange  forward and options contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures.

The related hedge transactions for balance in  cash flow hedges as at March 31, 2018 are expected to occur  and will be reclassified to the consolidated Statement of Profit  and Loss within three months.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge  relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness  assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists  between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including  whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes  in cash flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no  longer optimal but the risk management objective remains  unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge  accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by  adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument  or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio  aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the  hedge relationship rebalancing.

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the  Management considers whether some portion or all of the  deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate  realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon  the generation of future taxable income during the periods  in which the temporary differences become deductible.
The  Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred  income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and  tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based on  the level of historical taxable income and projections for  future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred  income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes  that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible  differences.
The amount of the deferred income tax assets  considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near  term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry  forward period are reduced.
The gross movement in the deferred income tax account  for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31,  2017, is as follows :  in ` crore Particulars Year ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net deferred income tax asset at  the beginning  333  284  Addition through business  combination (Refer to Note 2.1)  (2)  –  Translation differences  5 7  Credits / (charge) relating to  temporary differences 340  55  Temporary differences on other  comprehensive income 12 (13) Reclassified under assets held  for sale (Refer to Note 2.25) 53  –  Net deferred income tax asset at  the end  741  333  The entire deferred income tax, except for a credit of  ` 155 crore (on account of US tax reforms explained above),  for the year ended March 31, 2018, relates to origination and  reversal of temporary differences.
The credit relating to temporary differences during the year  ended March 31, 2018 is primarily on account of property  plant and equipment and trade receivables partially offset by  accrued compensation to employees.
The credit relating to  temporary differences during the year ended March 31, 2017  are primarily on account of property , plant and equipment,  and compensated absences partially offset by trade receivables  and post-sales client support.
2.16 Revenue from operations Accounting policy The Company derives revenues primarily from software  development and related services and from the licensing of  software products.
Arrangements with customers for software- related services are either on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe or  on a time-and-material basis.
Revenue on time-and-material contracts are recognized as  the related services are performed and revenue from the end  Consolidated financial statements | 237  Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 of the last billing to the Balance Sheet date is recognized as  unbilled revenues.
Revenue from fixed-price, fixed-timeframe  contracts, where there is no uncertainty as to measurement  or collectability of consideration, is recognized as per the  percentage-of-completion method.
When there is uncertainty  as to measurement or ultimate collectability , revenue  recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress  towards completion as there is a direct relationship between  input and productivity .
Provisions for estimated losses, if  any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period  in which such losses become probable based on the current  contract estimates.
Costs and earnings in excess of billings  are classified as unbilled revenues, while billings in excess  of costs and earnings are classified as unearned revenues.
Deferred contract costs are amortized over the term of the  contract.
Maintenance revenue is recognized rateably over the  term of the underlying maintenance arrangement.
In arrangements for software development and related  services and maintenance services, the Company has applied  the guidance in Ind AS 18, Revenue, by applying the revenue  recognition criteria for each separately identifiable component  of a single transaction.
The arrangements generally meet the  criteria for considering software development and related  services as separately identifiable components.
For allocating  the consideration, the Company has measured the revenue  in respect of each separable component of a transaction at its  fair value, in accordance with principles given in Ind AS 18.
The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold  separately is the best evidence of its fair value.
In cases where  the Company is unable to establish objective and reliable  evidence of fair value for the software development and  related services, the Company has used a residual method  to allocate the arrangement consideration.
In these cases  the balance of the consideration, after allocating the fair  values of undelivered components of a transaction, has been  allocated to the delivered components for which specific fair  values do not exist.
License fee revenues are recognized when the general revenue  recognition criteria given in Ind AS 18 are met.
Arrangements  to deliver software products generally have three elements :  license, implementation and Annual Technical Services  (ATS).
The Company has applied the principles given in Ind  AS 18 to account for revenues from these multiple element  arrangements.
Objective and reliable evidence of fair value  has been established for ATS.
Objective and reliable evidence  of fair value is the price charged when the element is sold  separately .
When other services are provided in conjunction  with the licensing arrangement and objective and reliable  evidence of their fair values have been established, the revenue  from such contracts are allocated to each component of the  contract in a manner, whereby revenue is deferred for the  undelivered services and the residual amounts are recognized  as revenue for delivered elements.
In the absence of objective  and reliable evidence of fair value for implementation, the  entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is  recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the  implementation is performed.
Revenue from client training,  support and other services arising due to the sale of software  products is recognized as the services are performed.
ATS  revenue is recognized rateably over the period in which the  services are rendered.
Advances received for services and products are reported  as client deposits until all conditions for revenue  recognition are met.
The Group accounts for volume discounts and pricing  incentives to customers as a reduction of revenue based on  the rateable allocation of the discounts / incentives amount  to each of the underlying revenue transaction that results  in progress by the customer towards earning the discount /  incentive.
Also, when the level of discount varies with  increase in levels of revenue transactions, the Company  recognizes the liability based on its estimate of the customer’s  future purchases.
If it is probable that the criteria for the  discount will not be met, or if the amount thereof cannot  be estimated reliably , then discount is not recognized until  the payment is probable and the amount can be estimated  reliably .
The Company recognizes changes in the estimated  amount of obligations for discounts in the period in which the  change occurs.
The discounts are passed on to the customer  either as direct payments or as a reduction of payments  due from the customer.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its  Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Revenues for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31,  2017 are as follows : in ` crore Particulars Year ended March 31, 2018 2017  Revenue from software services  68,460  66,383  Revenue from software products  2,062  2,101  TOTAL REVENUE FROM  OPERATIONS  70,522  68,484  2.17 Other income, net Accounting policy Other income Other income is comprised primarily of interest income,  dividend income, gain / loss on investment and exchange  gain  / loss on forward and options contracts and on translation  of other assets and liabilities.

Diluted earnings per equity share is  computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity  holders of the Company by the weighted average number  of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings  per equity share and also the weighted average number of  equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion  242 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2017-18 of all dilutive potential equity shares.
The dilutive potential  equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had  the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e.
the  average market value of the outstanding equity shares).
Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of  the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently  for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity  shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for  any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes  effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by  the Board of Directors.
A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows : Particulars Year ended March 31, 2018 2017 Basic earnings per equity share – weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding(1) 225,53,32,322 228,56,39,447 Effect of dilutive common equivalent shares – share options outstanding  22,41,548  7,57,298  Diluted earnings per equity share – weighted average number of equity shares and  common equivalent shares outstanding 225,75,73,870 228,63,96,745 (1) Excludes treasury shares For the year ended March 31, 2018, 67,238 options to purchase equity shares had an anti-dilutive effect.

These matters  are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the Management, including its tax advisors, expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate  resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position and results of operations.
Income tax claims amounting to ` 4,670 crore have not been considered as claims not acknowledged as debt because the Company has received favorable  decisions on similar claims and therefore, based on its assessment, is of the view that any liability resulting from these claims is remote and will not  sustain on ultimate resolution.
Amount paid to statutory authorities against the above tax claims amounted to ` 6,540 crore.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.
The Company’s  management does not reasonably expect that these legal actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will have a  material and adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

2.24 Segment reporting Ind AS 108 establishes standards for the way that public  business enterprises report information about operating  segments and related disclosures about products and  services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The Group’s  operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end  business solutions to enable clients to enhance business  performance.
Based on the ‘management approach’ as  defined in Ind AS 108, the Chief Operating Decision Maker  (CODM) evaluates the Group’s performance and allocates  resources based on an analysis of various performance  indicators by business segments and geographic segments.
Accordingly , information has been presented both along  business segments and geographic segments.
The accounting  principles used in the preparation of the financial statements  are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure  in individual segments, and are as set out in the significant  accounting policies.
Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises  in Financial Services (FS), enterprises in Manufacturing  (MFG), enterprises in Retail, Consumer packaged goods  and Logistics (RCL), enterprises in the Energy & utilities,  Communication and Services (ECS), enterprises in Hi- tech  (Hi-tech), enterprises in Life Sciences, Healthcare and  Insurance (HILIFE) and all other segments.
The FS reportable  segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services  operating segment and the Finacle operating segment because  of the similarity of the economic characteristics.
All other  segments represent the operating segments of businesses  in India, Japan, China and IPS.
Geographic segmentation  is based on business sourced from that geographic region  and delivered from both onsite and offshore locations.
North  America comprises the United States of America, Canada  and Mexico, Europe includes continental Europe (both the  east and the west), Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the  Rest of the World comprises all other places except those  mentioned above and India.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation  to segments are categorized based on items that are  individually identifiable to that segment.
Revenue for ‘all  other segments’ represents revenue generated by IPS and  revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan  and China.
Allocated expenses of segments include expenses  incurred for rendering services from the Company’s offshore  software development centres and onsite expenses, which  are categorized in relation to the associated turnover of the  segment.
Certain expenses such as depreciation, which form  a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically  allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are  used interchangeably .
The Management believes that it is not  practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those  costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are  separately disclosed as ‘unallocated’ and adjusted against the  total income of the Group.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group’s business are not  identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are  used interchangeably between segments.
The management  believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment  disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a  meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.
Geographical information on revenue and business segment  revenue information is collated based on individual  customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is  otherwise recognized.

2.25 Disposal group held for sale Accounting policy Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified under held for sale if their carrying amount is intended to be recovered  principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
The condition for classification of held for sale is met when the  non-current asset or the disposal group is available for immediate sale and the same is highly probable of being completed  within one year from the date of classification under held for sale.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are  measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
In March 2018, on conclusion of a strategic review of the portfolio businesses, the Company initiated identification and  evaluation of potential buyers for its subsidiaries, Kallidus and Skava (together referred to as ‘Skava’) and Panaya (collectively  referred to as ‘the disposal group’).
The Company anticipates completion of the sale by March 2019 and accordingly , assets  amounting to ` 2,060 crore and liabilities amounting to ` 324 crore in respect of the disposal group have been reclassified under  ‘held for sale’.
On reclassification, the disposal group has been measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less  cost to sell and consequently , an impairment loss of ` 118 crore in respect of Panaya has been recognized in the consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss for the year ended March 31, 2018.
The disposal group does not constitute a separate major  component of the Company and therefore, has not been classified as discontinued operations.

Upon implementation, the service is processing real-time data for more than 1,000 vehicles, and the client is planning to expand this to soon cover about 40,000 commercial vehicles.
