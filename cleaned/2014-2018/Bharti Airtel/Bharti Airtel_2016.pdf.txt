Therefore,  in order to maintain and improve the network  experience, we have embarked upon innovative  tools for near real-time optimisation through Self  Optimisation Network (SON) and geo-analytics.
Airtel has pioneered a customer  demand centric network planning  and densification by getting visibility  of the network consumption on a  granular 50m x 50m grid.
It has  helped in ensuring deployment of  new sites, small cells in corridors of  high consumption, thus improving  efficiency of new deployments.

16 Achievements in FY 2015-16 Bharti Airtel Limited 40-125 | Statutory Reports 126-355 | Financial StatementsCorporate Overview 02-39 11  Message from Chairman Although India, our core market, by contrast had a  reasonably good year; for Africa’s largely commodity  driven economies it turned out to be extremely  tumultuous, as weak growth was accompanied  by a sharp depreciation of currencies.
Overall, we  encountered a mixed economic environment in our   key markets.
T elecommunication witnessed phenomenal progress  on the innovation and adoption front.
As a sector, it  witnessed two remarkable trends in the emerging  markets – one, overall penetration of smartphones  expanded rapidly, resulting in a sharp uptake in  new applications and data consumption; two,  regulatory issues with regard to net neutrality and  OTT applications continued to be debated rather  vociferously.
Notwithstanding the overhang of  uncertainty over these issues, operators globally have  steadily come to terms with complex regulatory issues.
Early on during the year, Airtel moved past a key milestone,  when it became the world’s third largest mobile operator  (by subscribers).
The year also witnessed a steady  strengthening of our operating benchmarks in different  geographies.
The improvement was most conspicuous  in India, where we scaled up our margins and revenue  market share significantly.
Although improvement in  African markets remained rather subdued, following sharp  currency devaluations, caused largely by macro-economic  headwinds facing these markets, positive change in key  metrics definitely augur well for the future.
I firmly believe  six years of hard work has finally started showing some  results on ground.
Riding on rapid increase in smartphone penetration,  data revenues continued to be a key driving force of our  incremental revenues, both in India and Africa.
While data  customers accounted for 23.2% of our total customer base  in India, the corresponding ratio for Africa stood at 19.6%  at the end of the year.
Similarly, the share of data revenues  in total revenues stood at 23.3% and 15.6% in India and  Africa, respectively.
We expect these ratios to expand in an  accelerated manner in the coming years.
4G as a technology is maturing at a much faster rate than  earlier expected, particularly so in India.
Throughout the  year, we not only expanded our 4G footprint to nearly 400  Dear Shareholders, The global economy went through another challenging  year.
Even as the US experienced sustained recovery,  growth in the Euro area remained muted and China  continued to slow down, dragging down global economy  conspicuously.
Sunil Bharti Mittal 400 Cities and towns 4G  expansion undertaken,  making ours the widest  4G network in India 19.6% of our total customer  base in Africa are data  customers  Transformational Network 12 Annual Report 2015-16 cities and towns, making ours the widest 4G network in  India, but also acquired new spectrum from the market  under the new spectrum trading guidelines to consolidate  our 4G presence with a pan-India footprint.
We also  embarked upon a bold network transformation initiative –  ‘Project Leap’, involving a cumulative investment of   ` 600,000 Mn (USD 9 Bn) over three years.
During the year,  we completed one of the largest site deployment initiatives  in the world rolling out over 87,000 new sites.
Airtel became the first company in India to receive a  payments bank license.
I strongly believe with our deep  distribution network touching remote corners of the  country, Airtel Payments Bank is uniquely placed to deliver  a differentiated banking experience to our customers.
Other  businesses in India, i.e.
Direct to Home (DTH) and T elemedia  too, strengthened their operational parameters during the  year significantly.
Asset restructuring and rationalisation remained a key  guiding factor for us in Africa.
We entered into definitive  agreements, which will lead to Orange’s acquisition of  Airtel’s operations in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone.
We also achieved closure of the T ower Cos divestment  agreements in eight countries during the year.
T ower Cos  divestment will not only help us deleverage through debt  reduction, but enable Airtel to significantly reduce its   on-going capital expenditure on passive infrastructure,  besides helping us to focus on our core business.
Airtel Africa’s management structure has been  redesigned to achieve a higher level of empowerment  and accountability at the operating levels.
Under the new  cluster based organisational structure, Christian de Faria  has assumed the position of Executive Chairman and  Raghunath Mandava, who moved to Africa from our India  and South Asia operation has assumed charge as the Chief  Operating Officer.
Our philanthropic arm, Bharti Foundation expanded the  ambit of its initiatives considerably during the year.
Our  education related initiatives are today reaching out to  over 73,000 underprivileged rural children.
Similarly the  rural sanitation initiative Satya Bharti Abhiyan, launched  in the last financial year has already constructed and  delivered over 12,700 household toilets benefiting over  63,000 users in 559 villages in Punjab’s Ludhiana district.
The Programme is already being hailed as one of the  most successful private sector initiatives in the country in  rural sanitation.
Airtel Africa’s ‘Adopt a School’ initiative is  today reaching out to over 27,000 students with over 700  teachers.
T echnology innovations – from virtual reality and artificial  intelligence to robotics are taking significant strides to open  up numerous possibilities in our lives.
At the heart of these  exciting possibilities lie the global telecommunications  networks that are upgrading themselves with equal alacrity  to match the pace and scope of these innovations.
As new  innovations riding our networks evolve to the next stage,  network operators will no longer remain the proverbial  ‘dumb pipes’, but ‘smart facilitators’.
It’s an exciting future  waiting out there.
Sunil Bharti Mittal  600,000Mn ‘Project Leap’, involving a cumulative  investment of ` 600,000 Mn (USD 9 Bn)  over three years Riding on rapid increase in smartphone  penetration, data revenues continued to be a  key driving force of our incremental revenues,  both in India and Africa.
Message from Chairman  Bharti Airtel Limited 40-125 | Statutory Reports 126-355 | Financial StatementsCorporate Overview 02-39 13  Message from Managing Director & CEO (India & South Asia)  Dear Shareholders, FY 2015-16 was an exciting year for us.
During the year,  we strengthened our go-to-market operations, launched  innovative data propositions, accelerated postpaid  dramatically, besides enhancing customer experience  and stripping out waste.
As a result, this year we have  witnessed the highest ever growth in our market share.
We also accelerated our smaller businesses considerably.
Finally, we secured spectrum to further consolidate our 4G  presence, giving us a pan-India footprint for 4G services.
On go-to-market excellence, we further strengthened  our rural direct distribution and introduced innovative  demand generation initiatives.
We continue to push the  automation of our sales force processes and emphasise  on the quality of acquisition.
Data continues to be an  important component of our portfolio.
We have expanded  our 4G footprint across many more cities and towns in  India and have successfully positioned our brand as ‘The  Smartphone Network’.
Our brand is now in a very strong  position.
We have expanded our content portfolio with the  launch of Wynk Movies and Wynk Games.
We are committed to providing our customers the best  data experience possible.
This is why we announced a  bold and ambitious initiative called ‘Project Leap’ that  will see an investment of ` 600,000 Mn over three years  to transform our network.
As a part of Project Leap, we  undertook one of our largest sites deployment initiatives  this year, rolling out over 87,000 sites.
We believe these  efforts will help us perceptibly improve our network quality  and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
We accelerated the growth of postpaid decisively ahead  of competition through a combination of innovative  propositions, retail store expansion and a relentless focus  on execution.
In the home broadband business, we saw  tremendous growth in customer additions on the back of  carefully planned micromarketing.
We automated several  customer-facing processes and are continuously improving  the quality of our call centres, so that we can give a superior  experience to our customers.

Gopal Vittal Gopal Vittal Transformational Network 14 Annual Report 2015-16 Message from Executive Chairman (Africa)  Dear Shareholders,   T elecommunications continues to change the face of the  African continent by providing an enabling environment  for inclusion.
Bharti Airtel, is playing a central role in  addressing a range of socio-economic developmental  issues.
T oday, Airtel is bringing this technology to more  than 80 Mn people across the continent.
During the year, we encountered some headwinds  fuelled by currency fluctuations, regulatory issues  and other industry challenges.
Despite them, we  strengthened our operations through a well-considered  growth strategy.
Our strategic focus has led to an  improvement in our performance since Airtel’s entry into  Africa.
Some of the key focus areas during the year were:   Continuing our aggressive war on waste in all  our OpCo’s to ensure cost efficiencies across all  functions, leading to overall savings.
Growing our customer base with a focus on quality  and a pragmatic approach towards customer  interventions and engagement.
Network upgrades to cater for the existing and  expected data growth.
Focusing on enhancement of internal controls for  compliance and governance.
Some key milestones during the last financial year  included:    Airtel and Orange signing an agreement leading to  Orange’s acquisition of Airtel’s operations in Burkina  Faso and Sierra Leone.
Achieving closure of the T ower Cos agreements in  eight of the 11 countries.
We are confident to reach full  closure within 2016-17.
Right-sizing of our current workforce to create a nimbler,  high performing organisation.
Data continues to play a key role in driving our revenues  and we foresee growth in data subscriptions in the coming  years.
During the last financial year, our data subscriptions  grew by 28.5%, while total MBs on the network grew by  109%.
Data usage per customer reached 547.4 MBs by  March 2016, accounting for a year-on-year growth of 58.7%.
In the last financial year alone, we added 3,117 3G sites  across our markets in Africa.
We are also looking at steadily  enhancing our 4G (FD-L TE) network.
We currently have  Seychelles, Gabon and Rwanda enabled on 4G.
With over 9 Mn subscribers transacting close to   USD 16.9 Bn (Constant Currency) during the year and a  presence across all our 17 markets, Airtel Money is ready  to move to the next level.
Whilst DRC, Zambia, Rwanda and  Niger went live on the cross border remittance service, the  Airtel / MTN Remittance partnership for Burkina Faso - Ivory  Coast and Niger - Benin also became operational during the  year.
Our strategy for Airtel Money growth is to focus on the  ecosystem - expand our retail outlets and merchants.
Under Airtel Rising Stars, Africa’s largest youth football  property, we continued to focus on identifying and  nurturing talent from the grassroots level onto the national  and international stage.
In 2015, 476,000 boys and girls  in 28,000 teams participated in the ARS, which is a 6.25%  participation growth year-on-year.
Airtel Africa’s Corporate Social Responsibility programmes  are focused on health, education, environment and the  development of youth.
We have had noteworthy success  while contributing towards mitigating the Ebola crisis in  West Africa which was recognised by the African Union.
We are also actively involved in ‘Train My Generation’, an  initiative launched to train youth in ICT , under which 10,000  youth in Chad and Gabon will receive training.
Finally, success for Airtel in Africa will be through nurturing  a high performance culture.
We have to continue enabling,  encouraging and deploying the best in class talent to  achieve our goals.
In the next fiscal year, our objectives are  to grow our market share, reduce waste and accelerate  our non-voice business.
With our strategic plans and  supporting structure already identified, I believe that we are  well positioned to achieve our objectives.
I would like to extend my gratitude to our customers,  partners for continuing to support us in our journey and  look forward to an even more exciting year ahead.

For us at Bharti Airtel,  every leap is an ambitious, orbit-shifting  trajectory to chart a new course, set a higher  benchmark and take a historic step forward.
In FY 2015-16, we announced a ` 600,000 Mn  investment on a comprehensive network  transformation programme – ‘Project Leap’.
It will help us build a smart and dynamic  communication architecture to improve  customer experience through high quality  voice and data experience across India.
Project Leap 70,000 Base stations deployed  in FY 2015-16 Project Leap will enable us to  take a decisive lead in delivering a  differentiated customer experience.
Largest Deployment of Network  Infrastructure: We deployed over  70,000 base stations in FY 2015-16,  making it the largest deployment in  the history of India in a single year.
T oday, over 60% of Airtel’s network is  mobile broadband enabled.
In three  years, we will deploy over 160,000  base stations, effectively doubling our  presence from what it has today on  the ground.
This investment of ` 600,000 Mn is  over and above the ` 1,600,000 Mn,  we have already invested in our active  and passive networks, spectrum,  fibre, submarine cables and systems  till date.
This investment is one of the  largest by a private sector company in  India till date.

This technology  will enable us to offer 50 Mbps speeds  from its current 16 Mbps by 2016-17.
In addition, we plan to deploy fibre  network to homes, offering up to 100  Mbps speeds.
Transformational Network 16 Annual Report 2015-16 Truly Transparent  Airtel has been the first to launch the Open Network initiative to  empower customers and make them part of the journey.

Over a period of three years,  Airtel plans to deploy over 100,000  solutions through a combination of  Wi-Fi hotspots, small cells and indoor  solutions.
Strong Backend: We will cumulatively  deploy more than 550,000 kms of  domestic and international fibre in  order to drive down latency, improve  customer experience and serve the  growing demand of data services for  years to come.
Massive Modernisation of Existing  Networks: We will swap our legacy  networks and base stations over  a three-year period and replace  them with smaller, more compact  and efficient technologies that will  significantly improve customer  experience.
These modern base  stations will use a single radio access  network to manage multiple spectrum  bands.
Strategy for Small Businesses:  We will use our extensive domestic  infrastructure to deploy a range of  solutions comprising fibre optics and  Internet Wireless Access Network  (IWAN).
As a part of this programme,  we plan to provide seamless  connectivity to millions of small and  medium enterprises in India.
World-class Service Operations  Centre: We will invest in a broad range  of tools that includes Self Optimising  Networks (SON) for automatic  network optimisation, geo spatial  network tools for targeted network  planning, capacity enhancements,  Customer Experience Management  (CEM) as well as software defined  networks that will dramatically  improve customer experience.
Significant Reduction in Carbon  Footprint: Airtel will make substantial  investments in green technologies  over the next three years.
We will  deploy modern and less power  consuming radio technologies that  include compact base stations and  small cells.

In a  country with a significant youth bulge (over 65% of  the population is 35 or under, and half the country’s  population is under 25 years of age) our strategy is  to continue to innovate for New India; and find the  courage to chase seemingly ‘off-the-wall’ ideas.
We  believe that’s the fastest lane through which we can  get closer to aspirations, and create an experiential  world, our customers desire and deserve to live in.
6 Lakh+ Over 6 Lakh customers  are already part of the  ‘myPlan’ family  Transformational Network myPlan Family  The first ever family share plan by an  Indian telecom operator with sharing  starting at ` 99 only.

Development in Regulations The year saw several regulatory changes and developments.
7KHVLJQLǌFDQWUHJXODWRU\FKDQJHVZHUH India  Sharing of Active Infrastructure: In February 2016, the  Department of T elecommunications issued Guidelines  for Sharing of Active Infrastructure among service  providers, based on mutual agreements.
As per the  guidelines, active infrastructure sharing will be limited  to antenna, feeder cable, Node B, Radio Access Network  (RAN) and transmission system only.
Valuation and Reserve Price of Spectrum: In January  2016, TRAI issued its recommendation on Valuation  and Reserve price of Spectrum in 700 MHz, 800 MHz,  900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500  MHz Bands.
As per the recommendation, auction in all  the bands should be conducted simultaneously.

Spectrum  LQ0+]EDQGVKRXOGEHRǋHUHGLQWKHEORFNVL]HRI MHz (paired).
In case a TSP is able to win more than one  block of spectrum in the upcoming auctions, it should be  allocated spectrum in contiguous blocks.
Liberalisation of Spectrum:  On November 05, 2015,  the Department of T elecommunications issued the  Guidelines on Liberalisation of Administratively allotted  spectrum in 800 MHz and 1800 MHz band in a service  area for the balance validity period of right to use of  spectrum, after payment of auction determined price,  prorated for the balance validity period.
The entry fee  paid will be pro-rated for the balance validity period of  the right to use spectrum; and will be deducted from the  total amount to be paid by the TSP for liberalising the  spectrum.
In case the spectrum gets liberalised, the One  Time Spectrum Charges (OTSC) will be charged and the  same has to be paid by the licensee.
DoT guidelines on Spectrum Trading: In October 2015,  the DoT issued the guidelines on Spectrum Trading.
Spectrum Trading shall be allowed between two access  service providers, holding Cellular Mobile T elephone  6HUYLFH&0768QLǌHG$FFHVV6HUYLFH/LFHQVH8$6/ 8QLǌHG/LFHQVH$FFHVV6HUYLFHV8/$68QLǌHG License (UL) with authorisation of Access service in  a licensed service area.
All access spectrum bands  earmarked for Access Services by the Licensor will be  treated as tradable spectrum bands.
Only that spectrum  can be traded that has been assigned through an auction  in 2010 or afterwards, or on which TSP has already paid  the prescribed market price.
TRAI releases T elecom Consumers Protection (Ninth  Amendment) Regulations, 2015 on Call Drop:  On  October 16, 2015 TRAI releases T elecom Consumers  Protection (Ninth Amendment) Regulations, 2015 on Call  Drop, which mandates the originating service provider  providing Cellular Mobile T elephone Service, for each call  drop within its own network compensate the consumer  by crediting the account of the calling consumer by  UXSHHVXEMHFWWRDPD[LPXPRIGURSSHGFDOOVLQD day; and inform the consumer within four hours of the  occurrence of a call drop.
The Supreme Court ruled in  favour of T elco’s where it struck down TRAI’s directive.
Spectrum Sharing:  On September 24, 2015 the  Department of T elecommunications issued the  guidelines on Spectrum Sharing.
Spectrum sharing will  be allowed only for the access service providers holding  Transformational Network 88 Annual Report 2015-16 CMTS license, UASL, UL (AS) and UL with authorisation  of Access Service in a Licensed Service Area (LSA),  where both the licensees are having spectrum in the  same band.

TRAI’s recommendations on ‘Introducing Virtual  Network Operators in T elecom Sector’: In May 2015,  TRAI made its recommendations on Introducing Virtual  Network Operators in telecom sector to DoT .
Virtual  Network Operators (VNO) to be introduced through a  proper licensing framework.
The terms and conditions of  sharing of infrastructure between the Network Services  Operator (NSO) and VNO should be left to the market i.e.
on the basis of mutually accepted terms and conditions  between the NSO and the VNO.
An NSO shall allocate  a numbering range to their VNO(s) from the numbering  range allocated to it by the licensor.
VNOs shall also  utilise the LRN and network codes of the parent NSO for  the purpose of routing of calls.

Borrowing Cost   Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that  the Company incurs in connection with the borrowing  of funds.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of an asset that  necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get  ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part  of the cost of the respective assets.
All other borrowing  costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
3.6.
Impairment of Assets   The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed  for impairment, whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable or when annual impairment  testing for an asset is required.
An impairment loss is  recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset  or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable  amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the  greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in  use.

An impairment loss is only  reversed to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount  does not exceed the carrying amount that would have  been determined if no impairment loss had previously  been recognised.
3.7.
Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO)   Asset retirement obligations (ARO) are provided  for those operating lease arrangements where the  Company has a binding obligation at the end of  the lease period to restore the leased premises in a  condition similar to inception of lease.
The estimated  future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually  and adjusted as appropriate.
Changes in the estimated  future costs are added to or deducted from the cost  of the asset and depreciated prospectively over the  remaining useful life.

d)  Custom Duty   The Custom authorities, in some States, demanded  custom duty for the imports of special software on the  ground that this would form part of the hardware on  which it was pre-loaded at the time of import.
The view  of the Company is that such imports should not be  subject to any custom duty as it would be an operating  software exempt from any custom duty.

BSNL has raised a demand requiring  the Company to pay the interconnect charges at the  rates contrary to the regulations issued by TRAI.
The  &RPSDQ\ǌOHGDSHWLWLRQDJDLQVWWKDWGHPDQGZLWKWKH T elecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal  (‘TDSA T’) which passed a status quo order, stating that  only the admitted amounts based on the regulations  ZRXOGQHHGWREHSDLGE\WKH&RPSDQ\7KHǌQDORUGHU was also passed in our favour.
BSNL has challenged the  same in Hon’ble Supreme Court.
However, no stay has  been granted.
(ii)   In another proceeding with respect to Distance Based  Carriage Charges, the Hon’ble TDSA T in its order dated  May 21, 2010, allowed BSNL appeal praying to recover  GLVWDQFHEDVHGFDUULDJHFKDUJHV2QǌOLQJRIDSSHDOE\ the telecom operators, Hon’ble Supreme Court asked  the telecom operators to furnish details of distance- based carriage charges owed by them to BSNL.
Further,  in a subsequent hearing held on August 30, 2010  Hon’ble Supreme Court sought the quantum of amount  in dispute from all the operators as well as BSNL and  directed both BSNL and private telecom operators to  furnish Call Data Records (CDRs) to TRAI.
The CDRs  have been furnished to TRAI.
(iii)  In  another issue with respect to Port Charges, in 2001,  TRAI had prescribed slab based rate of port charges  payable by private operators which were subsequently  reduced in the year 2007 by TRAI.
On BSNL’s appeal,  TDSA T passed it’s judgement in favour of BSNL,  and held that the pre-2007 rates shall be applicable  prospectively from May 29, 2010.
The rates were  further revised downwards by TRAI in 2012.
On BSNL’s  appeal, TDSA T declined to stay the revised regulation.
Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its judgement  dated December 6, 2013, passed in another matter,  held that TRAI is empowered to issue regulations on  any matter under Section 11(1)(b) of TRAI Act and the  same cannot be challenged before TDSA T .

TDSA T has pronounced  its judgement on April 23, 2015 thereby setting aside the  impugned demands raised by DoT and directed to rework  the license fees payable in light of the judgement and  to issue fresh demands.
Pursuant thereto Union of India  (UOI) and the Company (on limited heads of revenue)  DORQJZLWKYDULRXVRWKHURSHUDWRUVKDYHǌOHGDSSHDOV cross appeals before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India issued notice in the  appeals and has declined to grant any interim relief to  UOI.
The appeals tagged together came up for hearing  on February 29, 2016 and the Supreme Court allowed  DoT to raise demands as per its understanding with the  condition that the demands raised will not be enforced  WLOOWKHǌQDOGHFLVLRQRIWKH6XSUHPH&RXUW7KHPDWWHULV likely to be listed for hearing after 8 weeks.

The Company (M/s J T Mobiles Limited subsequently  merged with the Company) was awarded license by  DoT to operate cellular services in the state of Punjab  in December 1995.
On April 18, 1996, the Company  obtained the permission from DoT to operate the  Punjab license through its wholly owned subsidiary,  Evergrowth T elecom Limited (ETL).
In December 1996,  DoT raised argument that the permission dated April    KDV QRW EHFRPH HǋHFWLYH DQG FDQFHOOHG the permission to operate, which was subsequently  reinstated on March 10, 1998 (the period from April 18,  1996 to March 10, 1998 has been hereinafter referred  to as ‘blackout period’).
On July 15, 1999, license was  terminated due to alleged non-payment of license fees,  liquidated damages and related penal interest relating  to blackout period.
In September 2001, in response to the demand raised  by DoT , the Company had paid ` 4,856 Mn to DoT under  protest subject to resolution of the dispute through  arbitration.
Consequently, the license was restored  and an arbitrator was appointed for settlement of the  dispute.
Arbitrator awarded an unfavourable order,  which was challenged by the Company before Hon’ble  Delhi High Court.
On September 14, 2012, Hon’ble Delhi High court  passed an order setting aside the award passed by  the arbitrator.
DoT in the meanwhile has preferred  DQ$SSHDOLQFOXGLQJFRQGRQDWLRQRIGHOD\LQǌOLQJRI appeal, which is presently pending before the Division  Bench of the Delhi High Court.
