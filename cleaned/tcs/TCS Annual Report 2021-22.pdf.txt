As  companies seek real-time data to transform their supply  chains, AI and predictive analytics help capture insights  and react to changing conditions.
Y our company is helping  companies reconfigure their supply chains to ensure that  they can serve their customers and stakeholders on time.
Letter from the Chairman  |  6 The change in technology consumption reflects  the prevailing trends in the economy.
Recent events  have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight  on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the  sustainability imperative.
Each of these represents an  opportunity that can contribute towards the growth  of not just your company, but of the ecosystem as a  whole.
Digital transformation is now an integral part of the  functioning of enterprises, governments and societies.
Y our company continues to play a critical role in  this transformation, helping clients embrace new  technologies, initially to cope with the crisis, and since  then, to innovate at scale and grow their businesses.
As a fitness enthusiast, I can tell you that the only  way to transform in the long term is by strengthening  one’s core.
It is no different for organizations.
We work  with large enterprises to simplify their technology  landscape and strengthen their core by building  a cloud-based digital foundation and embedding  intelligent automation into their operations so they  can focus on building memorable experiences for their  customers.
Artificial intelligence and data are key differentiators for  enterprises today.
TCS helps its customers stay ahead  of the game by investing in research and innovation,  tapping the intellectual capital within the organization  and also of our ecosystem through our Co-Innovation  Network which includes leading academic institutions  and start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies.
Our insights and foresight are also crystallized in the  form of AI-powered products and platforms that give  customers actionable intelligence.
Another area that is a priority for me at the Tata group  is sustainability and integrating that into business  decision-making and business models.
Y our company  is partnering with clients in taking up community  initiatives jointly, in sharing best practices around  diversity and inclusion, and importantly, in helping  them achieve their sustainability objectives using  technology.
In addition to reducing its own carbon  footprint in its journey to be net zero by 2030, your  company is helping the world’s largest corporations  in developing and executing their sustainability  roadmaps, deploying its portfolio of intellectual  property and services to help them track their  emissions, reduce their carbon footprint and get closer  to their net zero goals.
The supply chain upheavals during the past couple  of years are driving a shift towards rebalancing  and resilience.
As companies seek real-time data  to transform their supply chains, AI and predictive  analytics help capture insights and react to changing  conditions—from widescale disruptions to individual  customer complaints.
Y our company is helping  Dear Stakeholder, The past couple of years have been a period of  intense action and reflection.
We have seen a  global pandemic, geopolitical tensions, supply chain  disruptions, the rise of cryptocurrency and many other  public and private upheavals.
As the dust settles, and a  clearer picture of the world ahead emerges, I believe  we are standing at the threshold of a period of great  opportunity and growth.
In the face of widespread change, your company has  shown remarkable resilience and adaptability, coming  out stronger than ever, after catastrophic events like  the global financial crisis or the pandemic.
In FY 2022, your company crossed a milestone of  $25 billion in revenues, experiencing strong growth  of 15.9%, adding an all-time high incremental  revenues of $3.5 billion.
Even more satisfyingly, this  growth has come with an industry-leading operating  margin of 25.3%.
Since the start of the last decade,  the company has grown over four times, comfortably  outperforming its largest global competitors.
This  growth is the source of our energy and vibrancy,  reflected in the 17.7% growth in market value to  `13,83,427 crore in the past year.
Letter from the Chairman  |  7 companies reconfigure their supply chains in many  ways, including rolling out connected logistics to  efficiently manage business disruption and ensure that  they can serve their customers and stakeholders on  time.
I strongly believe that technology is at its most  transformational when combined with the strength  of human capital.
In FY 2022, our employee strength  grew to 592,195 with a record net addition of  103,546 employees.
Y ou will be proud of the way  your company supported its employees and their  families in dealing with the pandemic, including  organizing what was perhaps the largest vaccination  drive in corporate India for employees and families of  not just TCS, but also of its extended ecosystem of  partners and other group companies.
In turn, our employees have shown remarkable  resilience, loyalty and tenacity in ensuring that our  customers are not impacted, despite significant  personal challenges.
I salute their spirit.
Our purpose is anchored in the well-being of all our  stakeholders, and the communities we operate in are  very important stakeholders for us.
Drawing from the  legacy of the Tata group, we work closely with our  communities to create equitable, inclusive pathways  for all, especially women, youth and marginalized  groups.
We leverage four forms of capital - Intellectual,  T echnological, Human, and Financial - to bridge  the opportunity gap for people and communities.
Our primary focus areas are education, skilling,  employment, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, we  invest in basic health and wellness, water sanitation  and hygiene, conservation, and disaster relief efforts.
Since 2015, your company has invested $634 million  in its community initiatives and empowered millions  of people globally, primarily underserved students,  minorities, youth, women and elders, to be literate,  healthy, educated, digitally skilled, become rural  entrepreneurs and gain employment.
As we look ahead to the future, we go back to a  key pillar of our strategy – customer centricity.
Our  organization structure, our investments in new  capabilities and intellectual property, our delivery  models and contracting structures have all been  shaped by our clients’ needs.
Our new organization  structure is designed to make every client continue  to feel deeply valued, and to leverage TCS’ rich set of  capabilities and contextual knowledge to transform,  grow and build better futures.
With scale and by  steadily expanding its transformation capabilities, TCS  is moving from pursuing opportunities, to shaping  those opportunities in the years ahead.
I look forward to sharing with you more milestones  in this journey in the coming years.
On behalf of the  Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services,  I want to thank you for your continued trust,  confidence, and support.
Warm regards, N Chandrasekaran Chairman Letter from the Chairman  |  8 Dear Stakeholder, With near normalcy all around, the pain and suffering  caused by the pandemic at the start of the year seem  so distant now.
But the memories of TCSers and their  loved ones we lost during the year will forever remain  with us.
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone  who endured the loss of friends and family members  to the pandemic.
Given that context, I am grateful that on the business  front we have much to feel happy about and celebrate.
It has been a highly satisfactory year of consistently  strong, profitable growth.
In rupee terms, our revenue  was `191,754 crore, which is growth of 16.8%  (15.4% in constant currency).
Our profitability continues to be industry-leading,  with the operating margin at 25.3%, and net margin  at 20%.
Our Earnings Per Share was at `103.62,  growing 16.1%*  over the prior year.
Our cash conversion continues to be very strong,  with a cash conversion ratio of 104.2% and free  cash flow of `36,985 crore.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of  `22 for the year, bringing the total dividend for  the year to `43 per share.
Additionally, during the  year, we successfully completed our fourth buyback  in five years, to the tune of `18,000 crore,  representing a total payout of `38,010 crore  including buyback tax of `4,192 crore paid out in  April 2022.
This amounts to over 102.8% of the  free cash flow.
Our new purpose-designed organization structure,  along with continued investments in building  newer capabilities, next generation delivery models  and assets that help our clients innovate at scale,  and in building our brand, will help us deepen our  customer relationships, expand our addressable  market, gain market share and power growth in the  years ahead.
Letter from the 1 CEO 1 GRI 2-22 *Excluding provision towards legal claim in prior year.
Letter from the CEO  |  9 Beyond the headline numbers, we are pleased with  the holistic nature of the growth, broad-based  across all our industry verticals and major markets,  and with a steadily expanding number of growth and  transformation engagements in the portfolio.
Growth was led by Retail and Consumer Business  which was impacted the most during the pandemic  and which has bounced back strongly, growing  20.0%.
Manufacturing grew 16.7%, Banking,  Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.5% and  Communications, Media and T echnology grew 17.7%.
Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 20.6% and Others  which makes up 7.8% of revenues grew 15.5%.
All our major markets grew in the mid-teens or above.
North America grew 18.7%, Continental Europe  grew 15.2% and UK grew 18.5%.
Among emerging  markets, Latin America grew 18.6%, India grew 16%,  Middle East & Africa grew 16.3% while Asia Pacific  grew 6.9%.
Innovating for Greater Futures Our outstanding performance this year, and the  strong demand for our services that drove it, can  be traced back to the innovation that enterprises  scrambled to adopt at the start of the pandemic, to  engage with customers digitally and to improve their  operational resilience.
The cloud adoption trends strengthened further in FY  2022, with more clients embarking on multi-horizon  cloud transformation journeys .
However, the mindsets  have changed.
During the year, enterprises moved  from thinking of technology-led innovation as a way  of coping with pandemic challenges, to looking at it as  a means of powering their growth and transformation  (G&T), especially in the case of clients who had already  moved their most critical workloads to the cloud.
While G&T initiatives tend to be business focused and  technology agnostic, immense possibilities for business  transformation open up once enterprises move some  of their workloads to the hyperscaler cloud.
This is  triggering a wave of business innovation in the form of  Horizon T wo or Horizon Three initiatives by our clients.
In FY 2022, we won deals addressing a broad  gamut of G&T objectives such as M&A, newer ways  of working, product innovation, business model  innovation and innovations around improved customer  experience.
We have been providing examples of  these in our recent annual reports, including this  year’s report.
A new trend this year was the growing volume of  sustainability-related innovation, a good indicator how  this has become a top priority item on most CEO  agendas.
We have leveraged our deep expertise in  IoT, advanced analytics, and machine learning to come  up with a suite of offerings in this space, including  intellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™  and TCS Envirozone™.
Clients across industries such  as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods  are engaging us to develop innovative technology- led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to  measure and track green-house gas emissions across  their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon  footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling.
We are very proud of the steadily expanding number  of G&T deals in our order book because each such  win represents market share gain for TCS from legacy  consulting organizations which have traditionally  dominated this space.
It is an outcome of our sustained  investments in creating enabling capabilities within the  organization, be it in cultivating contextual knowledge,  or research and innovation, building intellectual  property, deepening digital expertise, cultivating  technology partnerships and building our brand.
The growing component of G&T revenue in our  portfolio is also evidence that our differentiated,  inside-out approach to transformation is resonating  well with our clients.
Our collaborative ways, and  focus on harnessing collective contextual knowledge  results in better buy-in for the transformation from  stakeholders across the organization, setting it up for  success.
Our brand statement, `Building on Belief’, has  also found strong resonance in the market, instilling  hope into business and trust in the enterprise.
All-time High Order Book All this is not to say that Horizon One spending, the  investments that enterprises make at the start of their  cloud journeys, while migrating to a new cloud-based  Letter from the CEO  |  10 digital core, is coming to an end as a key demand  driver.
Far from it, we saw strong deal flow right  through the year from Horizon One initiatives.
The sheer scale, depth of consulting expertise and  full-service capabilities of our dedicated business  units on each of the three large hyperscalers, and the  investments we have made in building a rich portfolio  of accelerators and toolsets for automating application  and data estate modernization and cloud migration  give us a distinct edge in this opportunity.
Clients engaged us for some, or all, of the activities,  starting from cloud assessment, business case  preparation, roadmap creation, ERP consolidation  and migration, application and data modernization  and cloud migration.
When core applications are  re-engineered using cloud-native architectures,  or on-premise ERP is moved to SaaS, it is not just  a technology transformation but also a business  transformation.
Such cloud transformation engagements are material,  multi-year transformation engagements which when  completed, result in resilient, future-ready digital  technology stacks that enable leaner, more agile  operations and very importantly, serve as a scalable  foundation for their innovation and growth.
Partnering with our clients in this initial phase is  important not only for the sheer volume of business  involved, but also because it is a gateway to the  unbounded opportunity that the downstream  innovation and transformation represent.
The granular  contextual knowledge of our clients’ business and  technology landscapes, gained while executing  Horizon One and other ADM programs, are critical  for our ability to proactively pitch innovative ideas and  solutions for their growth and transformation.
The other big demand driver was outsourcing of  business and IT operations.
There were three key  reasons why enterprises outsourced more in FY  2022: the need to free up people as well as financial  resources to execute their growth and transformation  initiatives; talent scarcity especially in digital  technologies, made worse by the Great Resignation;  and the desire for leaner and more resilient IT and  business operations.
During the year, we saw many  instances where clients engaged TCS to transform  their operating models, and then manage those  operations on their behalf.
Here too, our delivery model innovation, the Machine  First™ approach, helped us win many large deals and  gain share over pure play outsourcing companies.
Our transformational approach embeds powerful  technologies like machine vision, machine learning,  and our AI-powered intellectual property such as  ignio™ and Cognix™ into the core of our clients’  processes, transforming the human-machine interface  and delivering much leaner, faster and more resilient  business and IT operations.
Throughout the year, these three trends – increased  spend on innovation and transformation, cloud  migration and outsourcing – drove a strong flow of  deals of all sizes.
The total contract value of deals  signed in the first three quarters averaged between  $7-8 billion per quarter, capped by an all-time high  order book of $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
The  robustness of the deal flow at the close of the year  becomes evident when even after excluding the two  mega deals of roughly a billion dollars each won in  Q4, the order book TCV in Q4 was $9.5 billion, which  is also an all-time high.
The full year order book was  $34.6 billion, our highest ever, representing a book  to bill ratio of 1.3.
New Benchmarks in People Management Our purpose-driven approach to business and  our values have shaped TCS’ culture and work  environment.
We believe in investing in our people  and giving them opportunities to realize their full  potential.
We believe in decentralized decision- making, in empowering leaders on the front lines, and  in providing them all the support they need in their  journeys.
We also believe in treating the organization  as an extended family, and standing by each member  in their hour of need.
This was best demonstrated  in our response to the brutal second wave of the  pandemic at the start of FY 2022.
We scaled up  our employee engagement, provided hospitalization  support and access to Covid care centers at our  facilities in 13 cities and undertook a massive –  possibly the largest of its kind, pan-India vaccination  drive, covering over a million individuals – employees  and their dependents.
Letter from the CEO  |  11 This philosophy, and our progressive policies and work  culture have resulted in a very strong employer brand,  validated by several third-party assessments and  accolades during the year.
This played an critical role  in helping your company cope with the industry-wide  supply side challenges during the year.
T o support the strong growth momentum in FY  2022, we flexed the strength of that employer brand  to set new benchmarks and cross new milestones  in attracting and managing talent at scale across the  world.
Our workforce crossed the half-million mark in  the first half of the year, and we ended the year with a  headcount of 592,195, an all-time high net addition  of 103,546 employees.
The workforce remains a highly diverse one, with  over 153 nationalities represented.
We crossed  an important diversity milestone this year, with the  number of women in the workforce exceeding  200,000.
We are also making progress, slowly but  steadily, in improving gender diversity in the senior  management ranks.
Through focused leadership  development programs, the number of women senior  executives has grown 84% over the last 5 years,  significantly higher than the male cohort.
Organic talent development continues to be a key  focus area in our journey to be a G&T partner to  more of our clients.
TCSers collectively logged  60.3 million learning hours and acquired over  3.5 million digital competencies in FY 2022.
Very  importantly, the number of Contextual Masters in the  organization crossed 50,000 this year, 24% of them  women.
The year also witnessed a sharp rise in employee  turnover across the industry.
TCS’ attrition in IT  services (L TM) was 17.4% in FY 2022.
Despite the  increase, your company stood out with the lowest  attrition in the industry and remained the benchmark  for talent retention.
Community and planet We continued to work with communities across the  world, pursuing our long-standing commitment to  programs in the areas of health, STEM education,  skills development and the bridging of digital divides.
These programs are scaling well in reach as well as  depth of impact, touching the lives of over 1.7 million  beneficiaries – women, youth and marginalized people.
T o maximize the impact of our programs, we are now  partnering with our customers in these initiatives.
We  engaged with 850 business leaders and teams, across  146 customer organizations and connected with over  50 government leaders on collaborative community  efforts.
TCSers have also been quick to respond to the  humanitarian tragedy in Ukraine, helping in rescue  efforts, relief assistance, resilience support.
T o address  the urgent needs of children, women, and those facing  food insecurity, TCS is making a financial contribution  of 1 million Euros to international humanitarian  organizations like the UNICEF and the European  Food Banks Federation which are helping support war  refugees streaming into neighboring countries.
We  are also matching funds raised by employees, families,  and their networks, up to 500,000 Euros, as donation  to these two organizations.
On the environment front, we have good progress  to report in our journey to become net zero by  2030 .
Our absolute carbon footprint across Scope  1 and Scope 2 emissions reduced by 66% over base  year 2016 due to focused initiatives around energy  efficiency and transition to renewable energy.
We  made a big leap on the latter, with use of renewable  energy across TCS’ global operations growing to  37.2% of the total (15.6% in FY 2021).
Looking Ahead  Our all-time high order book, continued deal flow and  pipeline velocity give us confidence in the sustainability  of our business momentum.
We are in the midst of  a multi-year technology upgrade cycle that provides  strong, structural growth drivers for the next few  years.
The geo-political tensions in Europe and the resultant  impact on global economic growth are real threats.
However, the pandemic has shown us that enterprise  spending on technology is far more resilient than  most people credit it for.
It is central to organizations’  ability to innovate and differentiate in good times,  and to survive and adapt in tough times.
While  Letter from the CEO  |  12 evolving market dynamics may prompt reprioritizing of  programs, we are confident that technology spending  itself will continue to grow.
That growth and our  expanding market share give us confidence of being  able to sustain a certain base case growth, with room  to maximize in better years.
At our current pace of growth, it is only a matter  of time before we double our revenues and hit the  $50 billion mark.
In our journey to that next logical  milestone, we are focused on not only our velocity,  but also on ensuring we get there fighting fit, so it  does not become a finish line to stumble across, but a  launchpad to achieve even greater heights.
For this to  happen we are focusing on two things.
One, we want to arrive at that milestone with a more  balanced portfolio, with a much larger proportion of  business transformation revenues, so we have two  equally strong growth engines for the journey ahead.
For this, we want to build on our initial successes in  the G&T opportunity, and put in place a structured  way to deepen existing innovation and transformation  engagements, while expanding the number of clients  for whom we provide such services.
Second, as we get larger, we shouldn’t lose sight  of what has brought us thus far – our customer  centricity.
Our success stems from the fact that year  after year, our clients reward us with more work,  and rank us #1 in customer satisfaction across all  the service providers they work with.
Our approach  of putting the client at the center of everything we  do, making them feel special, and investing in newer  capabilities to create value in newer areas of their  businesses, has paid us rich dividends.
Regardless  of how large we get, we want to make sure that  our customer focus never wavers, and every client  continues to feel just as valued.
We have rolled out a new organization structure that  will help us achieve these two imperatives.
It retains  the atomicity of our earlier architecture, and its three  dimensions – industry verticals, horizontal service  lines and geography-based sales.
We have now added  a fourth dimension, the stage of the customer’s  relationship journey with TCS.
That journey begins when a client first signs up for  some initial work.
When we successfully deliver, they  give us more work and that is how the relationship  starts growing.
As trust levels steadily go up, they start  viewing TCS as a strategic partner and consolidate  more and more of their technology requirements with  us.
That is how we have steadily grown and deepened  relationships with nearly 60 clients globally who spend  more than $100 million on us annually.
We have rearranged existing units into three business  groups, each aligned to a particular phase in the  customer relationship journey: the Relationship  Incubation Group that will provide the high-touch,  high engagement, delivery-focused model that  new clients require; the Enterprise Growth Group  which will do what today’s TCS does best, that is,  pull together capabilities from across the different  service lines to stitch together solutions that address  our clients’ business needs when the relationship  is in its hyper growth phase; and the Business  Transformation Group that will manage our largest  clients and help them accomplish their growth and  transformation objectives.
As clients progress in their relationship journeys, the  account ownership will seamlessly transition from  one group to the next, with all three groups working  in synchrony to make sure that every client gets a  curated experience and that we steadily progress  every client relationship to the highest level of  maturity with TCS being their preferred growth and  transformation partner.
This new purpose-designed organization structure,  along with continued investments in building newer  capabilities, next generation delivery models and  assets that help our clients innovate at scale, and in  building our brand, will help us deepen our customer  relationships, expand our addressable market, gain  market share and power growth in the years ahead.
We thank you for your continued support in this  exciting journey ahead.

The new  innovation factory has released 12 products across over  40 design sprints at the peak of the pandemic, evaluated  over 40 potential use cases and reduced the time-to- market for new digital products and services by 50%  - a benchmark for organizations looking to embrace  innovation at scale.
• • • • TCS helped build a drug substance optimization  solution that uses machine learning to help supply  planners optimally allocate the raw materials for drug  production, leading to a reduction in raw material  scrappage and an additional amount of doses  produced annually.
A mobile track-and-trace app was built to provide  real-time visibility of product consignments for a  newly launched product with a very short shelf life.
A product was developed to help decision makers  evaluate various transportation and shipping scenarios  to optimize on time and cost of shipments while  reducing carbon impact.
A controlled substance control tower was built to  provide a single view of permits and visualization  of risks associated with the global movement of  controlled substance drug products.
We have developed a deep partnership with  TCS to set up and run an innovation factory  that’s developing digital products and services  across Takeda.
This model centralizes domain  expertise, design thinking and lean agile product  development as part of an end-to-end capability  that is driving digital transformation across our  global supply chain.

Hansjoerg Magalhaes Global Product Manager ERP Commercial and Supply, Takeda Customer Stories  |  33       Co-Innovating with Bovemij to Fulfill its Mission and Drive Growth For the last 60 years, Bovemij has been providing a  variety of insurance services such as auto, fire, legal  assistance, financing and other business services to  mobility companies – vehicle dealerships, fleet owners,  and service centers – in the Netherlands to help them  compete successfully in the marketplace.
T o keep fulfilling its mission of helping this ecosystem  stay competitive in a digital world, Bovemij partnered  with TCS to realize its digital strategy to expand the  ecosystem and bring in a richer set of offerings that  ecosystem participants could use to connect better  with digital native consumers.
TCS leveraged its Pace Innovation Architecture and  Pace sprints to jointly ideate and create unique, viable  and feasible business propositions for the ecosystem  Bovemij is committed to help the mobility ecosystem thrive in the  digital world.
We selected TCS as our partner to help us realize our  digital strategy because of the co-innovation architecture and agile  practices that they already had in place.
Using that, we could jointly  visualize the platform and the various business propositions, and  rapidly build out each such proposition.
Their expertise, creative  ideas and agile ways helped us get our platform up and running  much faster than we had anticipated.
Marcel van de Lustgraaf Member of the Executive Board Bovemij which would be offered  through a new Digital  Mobility Platform that would  connect Bovemij’s mobility  partners with consumers in  a B2B2C model across the  Netherlands.
TCS also set up a digital innovation factory, for  repeatable agile innovation at scale, to take each of  the business propositions and deliver them to market  at speed.
A minimum viable product was put together  in six weeks, with relevant user stories to demonstrate  outcomes and gain acceptance of internal and external  stakeholders.
In addition to providing access to its full set of  offerings to its regular B2B partners, Bovemij’s new  cloud-based Digital Mobility Platform is also enabling  new B2C propositions – offered on a subscription  basis – for its partners, to sell better to consumers  while embedding its insurance and other offerings into  those transactions.
Other propositions seek to benefit  the ecosystem as a whole.
For example, consumers  can sell their used cars on its portal, which mobility  companies can bid for.
Data from these consumer  interactions are being harvested for further actionable  insights for use by Bovemij’s various business lines and  other ecosystem partners.
Co-innovating with TCS is enabling Bovemij leverage  the power of the ecosystem to offer innovative  propositions to its partners and their consumers, carve  out a new brand identity for itself in the market, create  new revenue streams and drive growth.
Customer Stories  |  34 Ananth: The initial trigger for this acceleration was  the need to build resilience into the technology and  often struggle to innovate at that pace on their own,  for lack of processes, toolsets and also sufficient  dedicated bandwidth Partnering with TCS can help them overcome all  these issues.
We help them create a strategic agenda  using our tools and methods, especially our ‘Clay Map’,  named so in honor of the late Clayton Christensen  who greatly influenced our thinking on innovation.
We also offer the TCS’ Agile Innovation Cloud, a  framework for operationalizing innovation at scale,  which ensures that innovation does not happen by  chance but by design.
It brings together the best  of TCS’ innovation, global capabilities, ecosystem  partnerships, and talent to help our clients define their  strategy, create an innovation portfolio and scale the  execution of innovation.
Our clients tap into our contextual knowledge of their  business and technology landscapes, when they jointly  ideate with our teams.
They work with our start-up  and academic partners at our Pace Ports™ to harvest  many more innovation candidates than on their own.

business context of every enterprise.
The next trigger  was the adaptation required to compete in many  contexts created by digital business models.
Finally, as  enterprises are moving into a post-pandemic world  of new risks, challenges and opportunities, a more  strategic, purpose driven strategy is driving innovation.
These factors are driving enterprises to develop a wide  and deep innovation capability, which can scale.
This is  not easy.
Most have found it difficult to measure up on  both scale and speed.
Smaller competitors may offer  a non-stop stream of innovations.
Large enterprises  Panel Discussion  |  35 repeatable process which can significantly scale up and  speed up their innovation.
A good example of this is the innovation factory  we have set up for Takeda1 .
Using cloud, design  thinking, and location independent agile methods,  our combined teams are taking up innovative ideas  across procurement, logistics and finance, and building  innovative digital assets at twice the velocity.
Krishnan: The three broad themes around which we  saw our clients innovate the most were growth and  transformation (G&T), resilience, and sustainability.
We  have been making significant investments in creating  capabilities strategically relevant to each of these  themes, some of which we have described in our prior  years’ annual reports as well.
G&T is most often about expanding organically or  inorganically into adjacencies, be it of products and  services, or customers and markets, and occasionally,  moonshots.
Good examples are our transformational  engagements with clients like Swiss Re, Bovemij and  RS Components described in our FY 2022 annual  report2, or the work we have done for Bayer, Damen  Shipyards and T oyo Tires described in prior years’  annual reports.
We have been leveraging our deep contextual  knowledge of our clients’ businesses, extensive  industry knowledge and experience, our rich portfolio  of intellectual property, digital engineering expertise  1 Page 33, 2 Pages 41, 34 and 45 respectively Aren’t large enterprises also constrained by  their legacy technology stacks?
How do they  overcome that challenge?
and our differentiated inside-out approach to  transformation to help bring their G&T visions to  fruition.
Underpinning our work in G&T are our key innovation  pillars – our Pace Ports™, the TCS Co-innovation  Network (TCS COIN™), research collaborations with  leading academic institutions, `Future of Business’  frameworks, W12 design studios, and our products  and platforms like TCS BaNCS™, Optumera™,  Optunique™, ADD, ignio™, Bringing Life to Things™,  Cloudonomy™, and Cognix™ among others.
The second big theme is resilience, which is the  ability to weather foreseen as well as unforeseen  emergencies.
In these last two years, many of our  largest deal wins were around transforming clients’ IT  and business operating models, and their supply chain  management processes, using ignio or TCS Cognix to  embed intelligent automation for greater resilience  and agility.
Much of the rush to embrace the cloud in  the early months of the pandemic was also driven by  this need.
Lastly, we saw clients focus heavily on sustainability  in FY 2022, particularly around carbon footprint  reduction.
Our investments in innovative digital  solutions such as Envirozone™, Clever EnergyTM and  IP2™, and our expertise in cloud, data and analytics,  AI and ML are helping us win more and more of such  engagements, helping us amplify our contribution  to the worldwide collective effort to mitigate climate  change and build greater futures.
NGS: I call them heritage.
They have been around  and doing a good job of running their businesses in a  way that encapsulates their organization’s processes,  checks and balances.
Most organizations have worked  to build APIs or middleware that enable their digital  strategies, though they are suboptimal.
What we have observed is that as soon as enterprises  simplify their IT landscapes and build a new, cloud- based digital core, supporting micro services in a cloud  native environment, their ability to realize innovative  ideas and deploy them in production shoots up.
They  are able to anchor or participate in ecosystems at will,  which drives growth and innovation.

Our platform is extensible, supporting the  required APIs and microservices for them to leverage  fintechs and our TCS COIN partners to enable the  differentiation in the front.
Krishnan: We see this same dynamic with the broader  set of clients who undertake Horizon One cloud  transformations.
Besides enhanced ability to integrate  innovative new solutions into the core, their appetite for  innovation itself goes up.
The richness of the technology  capabilities built into today’s hyperscaler clouds triggers  more innovative thinking and the desire to experiment  with those powerful technologies to reimagine different  aspects of the business.
Another challenge that large enterprises face is the need  to invest for the longer-term growth of their businesses,  without disrupting near-term financials.
TCS helps them  square this circle by providing a line of sight for funding  the innovation pipeline or the transformation by helping  optimize operations.
We work closely with the client to reimagine parts of  their IT and business operations, or perhaps their IT  infrastructure, using our Machine First™ approach.
The  resultant operating models are leaner, more agile and  more responsive.
This frees up inhouse talent to take  up the more exciting innovation and transformation  initiatives.
One large US client of ours for whom we are  building a new, cloud-native digital platform to support  their business forays into adjacencies, calls it their `save  to invest’ strategy.
How do you see clients’ transition from  Horizon One to Horizon T wo spending affect  your growth?
Will there be a slump and  subsequent recovery?
Krishnan: The term multi-horizon may suggest clearly  delineated, sequential phases but in reality, clients don’t  wait to complete Horizon One, that is, migration of all  their workloads to the cloud before commencing their  Horizon T wo initiatives.
These progress concurrently.
Even as existing workloads are migrated to the cloud,  newer cloud-native systems are built to enhance  customer experience or to drive product or business  model innovation.
That is how we have been able to give  examples of G&T engagements being executed as part  of Horizon T wo investments in our quarterly earnings  calls, even though we are still in the middle of the  Horizon One opportunity.
We expect the transition to be a seamless one.
Horizon  One is a bounded opportunity and will plateau at some  point when most of the workloads are migrated.
By  that time, the other two horizons, which are boundless  opportunities would have scaled up and will support  our future growth.
All our investments into building  our G&T capabilities, our branding and the new  organization structure are geared to help us maximize  our participation at that point.
NGS: Our order book has had a good mix of small  and medium projects, as well as large outsourcing and  transformation deals in FY 2022.
This mix is important  for our short and long term business growth.
Projects  are increasingly executed using Agile methods.
The  focus here is to deliver 'speed to value' by structuring the  program over multiple monthly sprints.
Here clients are  more comfortable structuring the contracts with short  tenures.
The rise in the number of short tenure deals is  linked to the growing share of such work in our order  book.
On the outsourcing front too, average deal tenures  have come down on the heritage stacks.
That is because  enterprises are in the midst of a technology transition.
As clients migrate to the cloud, their legacy  In the last couple of years, the industry has  seen deal sizes reducing.
What is driving that?
Is that why smaller companies are growing  faster?
Also, is that why you adopted a new  organization structure?
We expect the transition to be a seamless  one.
Horizon One is a bounded opportunity  and will plateau at some point when most  of the workloads are migrated.

Given the desire to get this transformation  done rapidly, they are outsourcing the run and change  of the existing portfolio for relatively shorter tenures  and hence lower TCVs.
Krishnan: The impression about smaller companies  growing faster is more due to sampling bias, based on  a handful of highly visible outperformers.
That is not  true if you look at the global cohort.
Even though the  bottom quartile by revenue size had its best growth  in a decade in 2021, it still underperformed the top  quartile by a significant margin.
Overall, the current demand environment is a rising  tide that has lifted all boats.
Horizon One is a very  democratic opportunity, largely technology-centric.
Having enough people with the requisite certifications  and skills is sufficient to participate in this opportunity.
The severe talent scarcity is also driving a broad  The large scale vendor consolidation  anticipated two years ago doesn’t seem to  have materialized.
How come?
Krishnan: Vendor consolidation is typically done to  find an alternative strategic provider with a richer set  of capabilities and a superior execution track record.
However, the sharp recovery and subsequent growth  in demand, coinciding with the great resignation and  talent scarcity, have resulted in enterprises focusing  more on pursuing their immediate technology  priorities.
That said, we still won several large deals during the  year where we displaced incumbents.
If you look at  the global market, the industry grew 6% whereas all  the top tier players grew double digits, indicating that  the longer-term consolidation trends are very much  intact.
The industry didn’t see too many billion- dollar deals in FY 2022.
How important are  they for longer-term growth?
NGS: All deals are important to us.
Billion-dollar deals  are especially important because they boost medium- term visibility and provide us opportunities to bring the  whole of TCS’ offerings to play.
We are very pleased  at winning two such deals during the year.
Having  said that, the perceived importance of such deals for  longer term growth need not be exaggerated versus   smaller deals of say, $100million+ TCV.
For sustained longer term growth, what matters is  that the base order book size, excluding the occasional  mega deal, keeps growing year after year, and that  the quality of revenue keeps improving with higher  value engagements.
Our average order book size  which used to be in the $6-7 billion range in FY  2021 moved to the $7-8 billion range in FY 2022,  and ended with an all-time high order book of  $11.3 billion in Q4.
We are very pleased with that  progression.
outsourcing demand.
Also, smaller players are enjoying  strong demand from clients in the small and medium  enterprise category, with little competition from larger  providers.
We adopted the new organization for a very different  reason, so we reach our next revenue milestone,  fighting fit.
The new structure is designed to ensure  that our clients receive curated experiences which  make them feel just as valued, no matter how large  we grow.
It is also designed to help us replicate best  practices across our client base and expand the  number of clients who bank on us as their trusted  growth and transformation partner.
All deals are important to us.
Billion- dollar deals are especially important  because they boost medium-term  visibility and provide us opportunities  to bring the whole of TCS’ offerings to  play.
We are very pleased at winning  two such deals during the year.
How will the tensions in Europe, rising  inflation and the looming threat of a  recession affect spending on innovation, on  technology and on your growth outlook?
Ananth: Let me address the innovation part.
It is  a misconception that innovation is a nice-to-have  activity apt for only good times.
In fact, it is essential at  all times, good or bad.
In good times, enterprises  Panel Discussion  |  38 may fund more product innovation or customer  experience transformation, targeting business growth  or increased customer intimacy.
In tough times, they find new ways of working to  boost their resilience and adaptability – for example,  re-designing the value chain at a strategic level.
The sheer volume of innovation we saw over the  last two years, even in the face of bleak business  outlook, is testament to that.
We designed and rolled  out AI-powered digitized underwriting and claims  processing for insurers, omnichannel experiences with  in-aisle checkouts for retailers, or remote monitoring  and pre-emptive maintenance of equipment for  manufacturers and utilities.
None of these are `nice to  have’ capabilities.
These were necessary to simply stay  in business, to stay relevant in the face of changing  consumer behavior, and to cope with the operational  challenges posed by the pandemic.
So even in an economic slowdown, innovation doesn’t  stop.
They may reprioritize one program over another  based on shifting objectives, but the spending will  continue.
Partnering with TCS to innovate at scale will  enable them to try out more ideas, and experiment  more extensively with the same budget, and improve  the yield on their innovation investment.
NGS: We have been through multiple disruptive  macroeconomic events in the last decade and a  half – the GFC, taper tantrums, Eurozone crisis,  Brexit, the pandemic and now the war and the  resulting humanitarian crisis.
We always take a view  that business is about growing in a constrained  environment and over these events, we have survived,  continued to grow and have ensured that we stay  ahead of the technology curve.
This speaks to the  resilience of our business model, and of the essential  nature of the services we offer to businesses across  the world.
T oday, technology is central to any enterprise.
Businesses are rooted in technology, to the  extent that every company is aspiring to become  a technology company.
Insurers are launching  technology platforms for their ecosystem partners,  and generating new revenue streams from that.
The  world’s largest banks are incubating fintechs within the  enterprise, and betting on those to drive their future  growth.
Retailers are depending heavily on online  sales.
These are all recent structural changes.
Partnering with TCS to innovate  at scale will enable them to try out  more ideas, and experiment more  extensively with the same budget,  and improve the yield on their  innovation investment.
So conventional wisdom on technology spending,  based on historic behaviors during prior slowdowns,  may not be as reliable.
In the post-pandemic world,  we expect technology spending to hold up well even  in a downturn.
We can’t predict the future, but based simply on the  deal signing momentum, our pipeline, and our on the  ground observations of clients planning multi-horizon  investments for their growth and transformation,  we remain confident that we are on a good growth  trajectory for the next three to five years.
Panel Discussion  |  39 T ransforming Israel’s Banking Sector The Government of Israel’s Ministry of Finance was  looking to encourage the entry of new digital-only  banks that would boost competition, spark greater  innovation and rejuvenate the banking sector.
It  selected TCS to play a leading role in this initiative, for  its deep domain knowledge in the banking industry  and experience in working with the largest financial  institutions in the world.
TCS built the Banking Service Bureau (BSB), a shared,  end-to-end digital banking operations platform  powered by TCS BaNCS™, that start-up banks can  easily plug into, to launch their operations quickly  and securely.
It connects to the entire banking and  securities ecosystem in Israel, including local and  international payment gateways, stock exchanges,  various regulatory authorities and market data  providers.
The first bank to commence operations using BSB is  One Zero Digital Bank, Israel’s first completely digital  bank, and the first to receive a banking license in the  country in over 40 years.
Currently running as a pilot,  the bank will be open for all customers in the coming  months.
Besides start-up banks, incumbent banks can also  take advantage of the BSB’s modular architecture and  consume only specific best-in-class capabilities to gain  competitive differentiation and drive growth.
One of the modules in the BSB is its Digital Bank  Guarantee platform, powered by TCS’ Quartz®  blockchain solution.
It digitally transforms the end- to-end lifecycle of guarantees, enables seamless data  sharing with various beneficiaries, faster execution,  reduced errors, and enhanced transparency, security  and data privacy.
Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank,  with a 30% share of all bank guarantees in the country,  has signed up for this platform.
As the first digital start-up bank in  Israel, our motto is to provide differentiated  banking services and use technology to its fullest  potential to deliver an innovative alternate to traditional banks.
While we have started with Israel, we are keen to grow in other markets  too.
As part of this journey, TCS' Banking Service Bureau powered by the TCS BaNCS  product suite has helped us gain an early lead by making available a full digital core for  banking, including the necessary infrastructure and operational processes.
This has given us  the space to focus on our core offerings and launch banking services in rapid time.

This  will enable Swiss Re to provide a superior customer  experience, offer a broader range of products, and  take on more business.
The platform is being architected so that it can be  opened up to other insurers or reinsurers, giving them  access to new attractive risk pools through Swiss Re’s  extensive network of banks and other lenders.
Swiss Re, one of the world’s leading providers  of reinsurance, insurance, and other forms  of insurance-based risk transfer, conducts its business  with a clear vision: to make the world more resilient.
The company supports its clients with its deep  knowledge of risk and its capital strength, and helps  the world rebuild, renew, and move forward.
A distinctive aspect of Swiss Re’s business strategy is  leveraging ecosystems across its different businesses  to go beyond conventional reinsurance into new  products, services, and even entirely new models for  risk business.
It is creating new collaborative business  models where it partners with corporates to create  new solutions with embedded insurance, or with  other insurers, reinsurers and even governments to  leverage shared knowledge, expertise, and capabilities  – protecting more customers, in newer ways.
TCS is helping Swiss Re realise this ecosystem vision in  its credit and surety reinsurance business by building  a cloud-native, microservices-based end-to-end  underwriting platform, including the front-end digital  channels and a digital marketplace that offers instant  quotes.

Florian Maurer Global Head of Applications Swiss Re Customer Stories  |  41 Milind: Y es, it has been a challenging year for  employers all over the world.
In our industry, it wasn’t  as much due to the Great Resignation, as a churn  within the industry.
Peers who had not anticipated  the sharp demand recovery scrambled to fulfill it  by poaching at scale from other companies.
That  triggered a cycle of hiring and counter-hiring of each  other’s employees, sending attrition rates shooting  across the industry.
Our attrition went up as well.
But our commitment  to people, investing in them and empowering them  to realize their potential, along with closer employee  engagement, have helped us remain a benchmark  in talent retention.
We also expanded our hiring  program, flexing the strength of our employer brand  to attract experienced and fresh talent at scale.
We  undertook several other tactical measures to cope  with the supply side challenges, including generous  promotions, retention bonuses and increased use of  sub-contractors.
More importantly, we addressed the structural  problem of industry-wide talent scarcity by training  and onboarding 118,000 fresh engineers in FY 2022.
This massive infusion of fresh talent by us, as well as by  others in the industry, should start easing the problem  in FY 2023.
There are some early signs of this.
Our  attrition is plateauing on a quarterly annualized basis.
L TM attrition will likely rise further in the first half of  FY 2023 and after that, it should start tapering.
How did you cope with supplyside  challenges due to the Great Resignation  this year?
Is the worst behind us?
Milind: There are two reasons.
One, there was  significant offshore shift during the pandemic due to  greater acceptance of remote working, local talent  scarcity, and the flow of work to where the talent  resides.
That was deflationary in nature.
Second,  we have been hiring additional numbers ahead  of demand, in anticipation of continued growth  momentum and to have a ready bench to back-fill  attrition.
Over the last 3 years, your net addition  has significantly outstripped your revenue  growth.
Where is the disconnect?
Q&A with Finance and HR Dr Ritu Anand Head – Leadership & Diversity Milind Lakkad  Chief Human  Resources Officer Samir Seksaria,  Chief Financial  Officer Q&A  |  42 Samir: During the year, our annual salary increase  and the tactical interventions that Milind referred to,  resulted in a 330 bps margin headwind.
Operating  leverage, improved realizations and some currency  support helped us mitigate to the extent of 270 bps,  resulting in an industry-leading operating margin of  25.3%.
Looking ahead, I expect the supplyside headwinds  to persist for most of the year.
Additionally, as things  normalize, travel and facilities expenses should also  inch up.
That will be mitigated by the full year benefit  of large numbers of fresh engineers onboarded in  FY 2022, leverage from continued revenue growth,  improved realizations and hopefully, some currency  support.
Overall, we want to keep our margins stable in  the medium term.
Samir: We don’t provide revenue or margin  guidance.
However, 26-28% remains our longer term  aspirational band for the operating margin.
Setting  aside short term headwinds, we don’t see any change  to our longer term cost structures or our relative  competitiveness.
Just five quarters ago, we were in  that band, so there is no reason why we can’t get  there again.
Samir: We don’t think so.
We truly believe that  it is possible to pursue profitable growth without  compromising on either.
The data bears us out.
We  have kept our margins in the same tight band for over a  decade now.
During this period, we have outgrown our  largest and far more acquisitive local and global peers,  and delivered better margins..
The underlying premise of the question is that with  similar costs, higher margins must mean higher prices  versus competition, and therefore lower sales.
The flaw  lies in that assumption on costs.
While raw costs may be  similar, our cost of delivery is lower because of higher  level of industrialization in our delivery model, better  training and better employer practices, resulting in better  retention.
So we are able to compete very effectively,  and are winning all time high order books without  compromising on profitability.
Let me also explain briefly how we manage margins  on the ground.
We have devolved decision-making to  managers on the frontlines, closest to customers and  best positioned to assess the tradeoffs.
We hold them  Despite the strong growth during the year,  the operating margin stayed flat.
How should  we look at margins for the next year?
Y ou used to guide to a 26-28% range?
Is that  no longer viable?
Y ou have had industry-leading margins  for several years.
Is that constraining your  growth versus peers?
accountable for growth as well as profitability, while  giving them autonomy to shape the commercials of  individual engagements.
This has given us a class of  empowered, entrepreneurial leaders who win deals  going head-to-head with our most aggressive peers  on prices, if need be, while making up for the impact  elsewhere, and  delivering the committed margin at a  portfolio level.
Of course, we continue to invest heavily in building  capabilities to pursue the large organic growth  opportunity.
We are also open to acquiring assets which  add to our capabilities or IP assets, but the decision is  based more on valuations and ease of integration.
Ritu: We recognize the need to have a more diverse  workforce, and have been running a structured program  to drive diversity and inclusion within the organization.
For us, diversity is not just gender diversity.
We take  a broader and more inclusive view, including gender,  nationality, education, ethnicity, orientation, accessiblity  and so on.
By that measure, diversity in senior  management is over 30%.
We currently have over 153 nationalities in our  workforce.
TCS is one of the largest employers of  women in the world, with over 210,000 women in the  workforce.
This diversity is an aggregate outcome of  deliberate efforts around hiring in every market, talent  We have kept our margins in the same  tight band for over a decade now.
During  this period, we have outgrown our largest  and far more acquisitive local and global  peers, and delivered better margins..
Switching gears, only 13% of the senior  management are women.
What are you doing  to increase diversity at senior levels?
Q&A  |  43 development, promotion and retention, and policies  specifically designed to encourage talented individuals,  regardless of demographic profile, to plan longer term  careers in TCS.
Women make up 13% of our senior management.
But  that figure doesn’t tell the full story.
Within that cohort,  women fulfill 30% of our business development and  delivery management roles.
That is the pool from which  tomorrow’s business heads and top leaders will emerge,  so I find that extremely encouraging.
Also, that percentage translates into nearly 4,000  senior women executives, making ours one of the  largest such teams in the world.
Our policy of grooming  and promoting leadership from within, personalized  assessments, leadership development programs,  promotions and the collective efforts of the entire  leadership team have helped us grow the  number of  women in that cohort by 84% over the last five years.
With continued push and with new leadership positions  opening up faster, and in larger numbers because  of the high growth environment we are in, we are  confident that we will make more progress over the  next five years, than we did in the last five.
But there  are no shortcuts to this.
Ritu: Y es, we could.
Hiring only women senior  managers from outside for all new leadership roles Why not?
Y ou could just announce a target  to have 50% women in senior management  and hire accordingly?
One of the biggest contributors to our  industry-leading talent retention is our  long-standing policy of preferring internal  candidates for new leadership positions.
Hence  our organic approach.
This may take time to  show on the outside, but it is fairer to our  employees and more sustainable in the long run.

As you look at doubling your revenue, what will  TCS’ workforce look like?
Will you have a million  employees?
Milind: We believe our workforce will be more diverse,  demographically and geographically.
With a larger  business transformation component in our revenue mix,  I expect that we will also have more diverse capabilities  within the workforce – more researchers and innovators,  more business consultants across industry verticals and  technology horizontals, more product and IP owners, more  solution architects, and more specialists in softer areas like  empathetic design and organizational change management.
It is harder to predict how the headcount will grow.
With a  larger component of G&T revenues with higher realizations,  IP-linked revenues and the mainstreaming of technologies  like low code/no code which are less effort intensive, we  should be able to double revenues without needing a  million employees.
But even if it comes to that, we are no  longer intimidated by large numbers.
Our model has proved  its scalability, and we are confident we will continue to  remain a benchmark in talent management.
would certainly give us an opportunity to trumpet  our leadership in gender diversity.
But I see this as  unsustainable.
Women’s overall participation in the labor force here  is under 20%, perhaps 15% if you take the urban  workforce.
The percentage at senior management levels  is much smaller, and the available hiring pool is a fraction  of that.
Given this lack of availability at an industry level,  companies would simply end up hiring and re-hiring  each others' senior executives, driving up industry-level  executive churn.
Instead, the industry should address this at a systemic  level, and collectively do more of what we are currently  doing at TCS.
Run school-level programs to encourage  girls to pursue STEM education and careers, support  mentoring programs, provide opportunities to women  returning after career breaks, invest in leadership  development and increase the number of women at all  levels.
That will expand the industry’s female leadership  pool and give everyone an opportunity to avail the  benefits of diversity.
Milind: Also, parachuting external candidates into  leadership positions just to achieve a diversity quota  Q&A  |  44 Helping RS Components Deepen Customer Relationships and Drive Profitable Growth        Partnering with TCS in launching RS  Industria brought a number of strengths to  us – their IIoT expertise, their knowledge  around remote diagnostics and predictive  services, their understanding of the Amazon  Web platform and how to build really  advanced solutions in that space and lastly  their collaborative way of working.
All of  these helped us realize our vision around  this new offering much faster.
Richard Jeffers Director, Industrial Design Solutions RS Components RS Components, the world’s largest distributor of  electronics and maintenance products, is a trading  brand of UK-based Electrocomponents plc.
The  company supplies industrial products, electronic  and electrical components, test and measurement  equipment, engineering tools and consumables  via e-commerce, telephone and RS Local stores.
It  operates in 32 countries serving over 1.2 million  customers with 500,000 stocked products from over  2,500 leading suppliers.
RS Components partnered with TCS to create  a new business model that would enable new  value-added services in industrial maintenance,  foster closer relationships with customers, and  drive further demand for its products.
TCS used its  Bringing Things to Life™ IoT framework, and its deep  domain knowledge in digital manufacturing, remote  diagnostics and predictive services to help build a new  AWS IoT based reporting and condition monitoring  system that has been branded RS Industria.
This scalable, secure new platform allows customers to  connect their manufacturing assets quickly and easily,  for real time monitoring that provides insights into the  causes of production losses and component failure.
RS Components’ first client for this solution, a food  manufacturing site in the UK, has a number of high  value assets such as industrial motors, production line  equipment and a treatment plant connected to the  platform.
The real-time monitoring and insights generated by the system have helped cut fresh water  consumption, and also reduce the effort and cost of  managing the wastewater treatment.
The system is also being used to help reduce the  site’s energy consumption by monitoring usage at  a production line level, highlighting specific areas of  energy loss in the production process.
In the near  future, the customer is using the modularity of RS  Industria to rapidly expand the system to enable  condition monitoring of critical assets.
RS Components and TCS are now working together  to replicate this success for other end-customers  in other industry segments.
Partnering with TCS  for its growth and transformation has helped RS  Components embrace a new business model that  makes it a valued and trusted business partner to  its customers, creates new revenue streams, boosts  profitability and reinforces its position as an innovation  pioneer in the industrial component ecosystem.
Customer Stories  |  45 Boosting Colruyt’s Competitiveness with Algorithmic Pricing Colruyt is a leading retailer in Europe with online  shops and over 1,000 physical outlets across Belgium,  Luxembourg and France.
It has ten business formats  and diversified business lines.
Colruyt’s business success has been built on keeping  costs down and investing resources in guaranteeing  the lowest price for every product at any time.
But this is no easy feat.
Staying on top means  monitoring competitors’ online and in-store prices and  promotions, and responding to changes with updated  prices for those items, as well as for hierarchically  linked items, across all stores and business formats.
Over time, Colruyt’s pricing processes were  finding it difficult to cope with the sheer volumes  and complexity.
Colruyt started the successful  collaboration with TCS as the strategic partner to  harness the power of automation and other digital  technologies to transform its pricing platform.
Colruyt and TCS collaborated successfully to  implement the Next-Gen Pricing Engine, an  algorithmic, near real-time, intelligent system that  automates the deployment of the pricing strategy  across products, linked items, stores, channels and  brands.
T o improve the instore price recording from  competitor locations, a real time mobile app was  launched to boost the productivity and accuracy.
The  system uses in-parallel memory processing for large  volumes of data to generate price recommendations  at near real time speed.
Very importantly, the engine caters to the varied  pricing strategies relevant to Colruyt’s different  business lines – regular everyday low prices, high-low,  promotions and markdown, enabling the competitive  benefits to accrue across the enterprise.
Partnering with TCS for the innovative use of  technology is helping Colruyt respond to competitors  24 x 7 with speed and agility, capturing over 100,000  competitor prices, and processing up to 50 million  reaction prices per day.
This has helped the retailer  strengthen its competitive differentiation, live up to its  brand promise and drive growth.
At Colruyt, we continuously focus on  technology innovation to help our  businesses respond quickly to changes in  the market, and to grow.
The Next-Gen  Pricing Engine is one such innovative,  mission-critical platform that we have built  in partnership with TCS.
Their deep retail  industry knowledge, digital expertise and  collaborative ways of working helped us  accomplish our vision to harness the power  of AI, automation and digital technologies  to help elevate our brand and strengthen  our competitive edge.
Peter Vanbellingen CIO, Colruyt IT Customer Stories  |  46 Our partnership with TCS is helping us to realise  our strategy of investing in technology enabled  solutions to improve customer experience.

Deo Shankar T ripathi MD and CEO Aadhar Housing Finance Limited T ransforming India’s Lending Sector with a New Digital Platform Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are a  key component of India’s financial ecosystem, helping  make credit and other financial services accessible  to the small-scale and unorganized sectors, and to  the large unbanked population.
However, with low  technology intensity and largely manual processes,  these firms have struggled to meet consumer  expectations around digital experience and speed  of service on the one hand, and with regulatory  compliance and lack of easy access to capital on the  other hand.
This has held back the sector’s growth  relative to the market’s potential.
Recognizing that the industry’s fragmented structure  and common attributes lent itself to a cloud-based  SaaS platform, TCS built a first-of-its-kind, cloud- based lending and securitization solution, bringing  together the power of two of its highly successful  products – TCS BaNCS™ and TCS iON™, and the  DigiGOV™ governance framework, to completely  digitize and reimagine the core processes for the  sector.
The new platform is a collaborative, connected  system that transforms the end-to-end lending and  securitization value chain, offering secure and timely  flow of data among stakeholders within the ecosystem.
It leverages AI and ML to enhance end-customer and  internal-stakeholder experience, and improve speed  and accuracy in decision-making.
NBFCs subscribing to the platform benefit  from enhanced customer experience, improved  liquidity, more resilient and agile operations, and  improved regulatory compliance across lending and  securitization.
Impressed with the rich functionality,  flexibility and scalability of the solution, some of India’s  largest private sector banks are also adopting it for  their personal lending business.
Aadhar Housing Finance Limited, a housing finance  company with a pan-India presence implemented  TCS’ lending and securitization solution in FY 2022  and has been able to transform its operations, end to  end.
At the back end, TCS’ solution has helped strengthen  controls, ease regulatory compliance, enhance data  security and drive operational efficiency.
On the front  end, it has enabled easier and more efficient customer  experience.
The solution’s robust lead management  processes, with lead tracking and reporting have  helped drive Aadhar’s growth and expand its market  presence.

: 1129/2021 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Management Discussion and Analysis  |  107 Management  Discussion and  Analysis Overview of the Industry The global economy recovered strongly in   CY 2021 even as new variants of the COVID-19  virus fueled additional waves of the pandemic.
Robust  policy support in advanced economies, availability  of vaccines and relaxation of pandemic restrictions  helped economies bounce back, collectively  expanding world output by an estimated 6.1%1.
Global technology spending grew strongly in  2021 to $1.7 trillion2.
The primary drivers were  accelerated investments in digital transformation and  cloud adoption in response to changed consumer  behaviors and the need for greater operational  resilience.
Additionally, there was increased  outsourcing by enterprises looking to free up  financial as well as human resources to execute their  transformation programs.
A severe talent scarcity  added to the outsourcing imperative.
IT services  grew 6.2% Y oY, crossing $899 billion while BPM  grew nearly 5% to reach $211 billion.
The global IT services industry continues to be  a highly fragmented one, with even the largest  provider having a mid-single digit market share.
TCS is among the largest IT services providers  1  World Economic Outlook, IMF, April 2022  2 Nasscom Strategic Review Report 2022 globally, with a market share of 2.3%, and has  outperformed the market, growing significantly  higher than market growth over the last decade.

The  new model recognizes that customers’ needs vary  and evolve over time as they progress in their  relationship journey with TCS, and enables the  delivery of a curated experience best suited for each  customer’s current stage in that journey.
It does  this by adding a fourth dimension – i.e.
customer  relationship stage – to the existing three dimensions  of TCS’ organization structure: geography, industry  vertical and service line.
Customer acquisition will continue to be done by  local sales teams in the various markets.
Existing  customers in major markets will continue to be  serviced by the same client partners, but the  governance layer on top has been realigned.
Instead  of being governed as vertical-wise business groups,  customers have now been segmented by relationship  stage, and vested with three business groups: 	 Relationship Incubation Group to manage  new relationships which require a higher level  of hand holding and a differentiated, high touch  delivery; 	 Enterprise Growth Group to manage  relationships which are in the high growth  phase; 	 Business Transformation Group to manage  large and mature relationships.
The company’s primary reporting segments will  continue to be industry verticals and geographic  markets.
Existing verticalized governance structures,  the Industry Solution Units (ISUs) and sub-ISUs,  will see their portfolios realigned and rationalized  under these three business groups.
Customers in  emerging markets will continue to be serviced by  local country-based organizations.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Management Discussion and Analysis  |  110 The sharper customer focus enabled by the new structure and the resultant curated customer experiences are expected to enhance customer intimacy, facilitate cross- selling and up-selling, expand share of wallet and prepare the company for the journey ahead.

Enterprise Risk Management While the world and businesses are recovering  from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic of  the last two years, new external and internal risks  continue to challenge businesses in every possible  way amplifying existing risks.
Not only are the nature  of risks evolving, but the speed of risk is increasing  with faster time to impact.
Geo-political situations  like the Russia Ukraine war have further forced  global businesses to revisit their operations, delivery,  supply chains and contractual aspects.
Operating in  an uncertain and ever-changing environment, TCS’  global operations bring in considerable complexities  and TCS’ robust enterprise risk management  framework aids in ensuring the strategic  objectives are achieved.
This framework enables  risk identification, risk assessment, risk response  planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk  governance.
Key Risk Indicators are used to identify  and assess risks.
The digital platform for integrated  risk management provides an enterprise-wide view  of risks covering strategic, operational, compliance,  financial and catastrophic risks, providing a holistic  approach towards informed decision making.
Risks  are assessed and managed at various levels with a  top-down and bottom-up approach covering the  enterprise, the business units, the geographies, the  functions, the customer relationships and projects.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Management Discussion and Analysis  |  121 Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact on the company and mitigation strategies.
Key Risks  Impact on the Company Mitigation Volatile global  political and  economic scenario The company derives a material portion of its revenues  from customers’ discretionary spending which is linked  to their business outlook.
Geo-political disruptions such as the war in Ukraine  and resultant volatility in the global economy, or trade  wars may adversely affect that outlook resulting in  reduced spending which could restrict revenue growth  opportunities.
This could also result in steep inflation globally which  could impact client spending as well as increase TCS’  cost of doing business.
Additionally, there could be higher risk to service  delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions  compliance and human rights risks in geo-politically  sensitive zones.
• Broad-based business mix, well diversified across geographies and industry verticals.
• Monitor changing geopolitical scenarios, the potential business implications and  strengthen internal controls to further safeguard against secondary risks.
• Offerings and value propositions targeting all stakeholders (in addition to the CIO)  in the customer organization, covering discretionary as well as non-discretionary  spends, and relevant at every point in the business cycle.
• Participate in the customer’s growth and transformation initiatives through services  and offerings including advisory services, migration and modernization of applications  and workplace transformation using location independent agile, deep contextual  knowledge and data-driven analytics and dashboards.
• Proactively investing in infrastructure and resourcing to satisfy anticipated customer  demand for flexible products and platforms based solution offerings and subscription- based services to gain market share and new clients and markets.
• More long-term contracting models.
• Leverage business ecosystem through collaboration with partners, start-ups and  alliances to participate in transformation initiatives of customers.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Management Discussion and Analysis  |  122 Key Risks  Impact on the Company Mitigation Disruption and  uncertainty in  business due to  the COVID-19  pandemic While presently the severity of the disease due  to COVID-19 has reduced because of increased  vaccination, as immunity may wane over a period of  time, there is a risk of further waves and emergence of  highly transmissible and more virulent variants.
This may have an impact on the health and safety,  emotional wellbeing and mobility of TCS’ workforce,  which in turn may impact service delivery and revenues.
If large numbers of employees are affected, it could  result in business disruption and necessitate higher  spends for ensuring business resiliency.
There could be  hesitation to come back to office in the near future from  employees who have been working remotely from their  hometowns.
• Encourage new employees to get vaccinated as per the country level internal  vaccination policies, government guidelines and including facilitating booster doses as  available.
• Employee well-being initiatives like 24*7 dedicated helpline for employees to  address COVID-19 related help, queries for emotional support, interactive sessions,  counseling services (TCS Cares), medical hotline to doctors, fitness sessions for  employees and Covid Care Centres in TCS premises.
• Enable employees to return to office while providing flexibility through the hybrid  work model using Secure Borderless WorkSpaces (SBWSTM) for remote working,  while following safe protocols like masks and social distancing in offices.
• Leverage emerging technology based tools to anticipate and be resilient for any  upcoming COVID-19 waves / variants.
• The COVID-19 Apex committee at Enterprise level continues to monitor the residual  risks and coordinate global efforts required, based on frequent risk assessments.
• Regular communication with customers about measures taken to maintain business  services and reporting of their operations status.
• Regular coordination with key suppliers for expeditious provisioning of assets critical  for business services.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Management Discussion and Analysis  |  123 Key Risks  Impact on the Company Mitigation • SOP for operating TCS Offices including implementing Safe Operating Zones for  associates requiring to work from office, thermal screening, frequent sanitization  of premises, social distancing layout etc.
AI-based Workplace resilience tool  implemented in Delivery Centres to aid in risk profiling and contact tracing.
• Revised Business Continuity plans which are benchmarked against ISO 22301 in  place, for hybrid mode of working and to address any future waves of the pandemic.
• Remote working practices for managers and employees integrated into the Location  Independent Agile delivery method, to ensure effectiveness and productivity.
• Monitor changes in regulations related to the impact due to pandemic and align  internal policies accordingly.
Talent risk due to  huge demand for  talent globally and  attrition The company’s ability to attract, develop, motivate, and  retain talent is critical to business success.
Increase  in attrition can impact TCS’ ability to deliver existing  business engagements and grow.
Inability to attract experienced professionals with   niche digital skills from the market, can also impact TCS’  ability to grow.
• Commitment to organic talent development, best in class learning and development,  linkage of career growth to learning, and preference to internal talent for new  leadership positions, all incentivize planning of longer-term careers in TCS.
• Focused tactical initiatives to retain talent using proactive as well as reactive  initiatives; increased employee engagement.

Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Corporate Governance Report  |  137 Corporate  Governance  Report I.  Company’s Philosophy on Corporate  Governance 	 Effective	corporate	governance	practices	 constitute	the	strong	foundation	on	which	 successful	commercial	enterprises	are	built	to	 last.
The	Company’s	philosophy	on	corporate	 governance	oversees	business	strategies	and	 ensures	fiscal	accountability,	ethical	corporate	 behaviour	and	fairness	to	all	stakeholders	 comprising	regulators,	employees,	customers,	 vendors,	investors	and	the	society	at	large.
Strong	leadership	and	effective	corporate	 governance	practices	have	been	the	Company’s	 hallmark	inherited	from	the	Tata	culture	and	 ethos.
The	 Company	follows	the	Tata	Group	philosophy	 of	building	sustainable	businesses	that	are	 rooted	in	the	community	and	demonstrate	care	 for	the	environment.
Being	a	part	of	the	  Tata	Group,	which	epitomizes	sustainability,	 TCS	has	inherited	a	strong	legacy	of	fair	and	 transparent	ethical	governance,	as	embodied	in	 the	Tata	Code	of	Conduct	(TCoC).
The	Company	has	adopted	a	Code	of	Conduct	 for	its	employees	including	the	Managing	 Director	and	the	Executive	Directors.
In	addition,	the	Company	has	adopted	a	Code	of	 Conduct	for	its	non-executive	directors	which	 includes	Code	of	Conduct	for	Independent	 Directors	that	suitably	incorporates	the	duties	 of	independent	directors	as	laid	down	in	the	 Companies	Act,	2013	(“the	Act”).
The	Company’s	corporate	governance	 philosophy	has	been	further	strengthened	 through	the	Tata	Business	Excellence	Model,	  the	TCS	Code	of	Conduct	for	Prevention	of	 Insider	Trading	and	the	Code	of	Corporate	 Disclosure	Practices	(“Insider	Trading	Code”).
The	Company	has	in	place	an	Information	 Security	Policy	that	ensures	proper	utilization	of	 IT	resources.
The	Company	is	in	compliance	with	the	 requirements	stipulated	under	Regulation	17	 to	27	read	with	Schedule	V	and	clauses	(b)	to	(i)	 and	(t)	of	sub-regulation	(2)	of	Regulation	46	of	 Securities	and	Exchange	Board	of	India	(Listing	 Obligations	and	Disclosure	Requirements)	 Regulations,	2015	(“SEBI	Listing	Regulations”),	 as	applicable,	with	regard	to	corporate	 governance.
The	details	of	TCS’	board	structure	and	 the	various	committees	that	constitute	the	 governance	structure1	of	the	organization	are	 covered	in	detail	in	this	report.
1	GRI	2-9 Integrated	Annual	Report	2021-22 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Corporate Governance Report  |  138 The	various	material	aspects	of	corporate	governance	and	TCS’	approach	to	them	 are	discussed	in	the	table	below:			2 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Board	 effectiveness,	 independence	 and	protection	 of	minority	 shareholders’	 interests Board	effectiveness	is	enhanced	by	setting	a	high	bar	in	selecting	 the	right	mix	of	individuals	to	serve	on	the	Board,	with	the	right	 qualifications,	expertise	and	experience,	who	can	collectively	 serve	the	best	interests	of	all	stakeholders,	maintain	board	and	 management	accountability	and	drive	corporate	ethics,	values	and	 sustainability.
Profiles	of	Board	members	are	available	at	  https://www.tcs.com/ir-corporate-governance  For	greater	diversity	of	opinions	and	perspectives	within	the	Board,	 the	Nomination	and	Remuneration	Committee2	has	fostered	diversity	 in	terms	of	backgrounds,	areas	of	expertise	and: •	 Gender:	2	of	the	9	(22.2	percent)	members	are	women.
•		Nationality:	3	nationalities	represented	–	Indian,	American	and	 Danish.
•	 	Industry:	Technology,	Banking,	Energy,	Transportation	and	 Academia.
TCS’	policy	on	Appointment	of	Directors	and	Board	Diversity	can	be	 found	at	https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD.
Board	independence	is	ensured	by	having	an	independent	majority,	 with	5	independent	directors	out	of	9	i.e.,	55.6	percent.
None	of	the	 independent	directors	is	related	to	each	other,	or	to	the	  non-independent	directors.
Average	tenure	of	independent	directors	 is	5	years.
2	GRI	2-10 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Board	effectiveness	is	further	improved	by	ensuring	that	none	of	the	 directors	holds	directorships	in	more	than	seven	listed	entities,	and	 none	of	the	executive	directors	serve	as	an	independent	director	on	 the	Boards	of	more	than	three	listed	entities.
TCS’	governance	philosophy	around	minority	shareholders’	interests	 is	guided	by	the	TCoC	which	emphasizes	fairness	and	transparency	to	 all	stakeholders.
Further	a	qualified,	diverse	and	independent	Board	 ensures	that	minority	shareholders’	interests	are	protected.
TCS	strives	to	reduce	information	asymmetry	through	transparency,	 extensive	disclosures	and	detailed	commentary	of	the	demand	 environment	and	the	state	of	the	business,	and	material	 developments.
The	Company	provides	a	variety	of	channels	including	 a	structured	global	investor	outreach	program,	through	which	 minority	shareholders	can	interact	with	the	management	or	the	 Board.
Shareholders	can	communicate	concerns	and	grievances	to	the	 Company	Secretary’s	office	through	a	well-publicized	channel,	where	 complaints	are	tracked	to	closure.
The	Stakeholders’	Relationship	 Committee	oversees	the	redressal	of	these	complaints.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Corporate Governance Report  |  139 3 4 5 6 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Avoidance	of	 conflict	of	interest3 Chairmanship4	of	the	Board	is	a	non-executive	position,	and	separate	 from	that	of	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Managing	Director	 (CEO	and	MD).
TCoC5	for	non-executive	directors,	and	for	independent	directors,	 carries	explicit	clauses	covering	avoidance	of	conflict	of	interest.
Likewise,	it	explicitly	prohibits	any	employee	–	including	the	 Managing	Director	and	executive	directors	–	from	accepting	any	 position	of	responsibility,	with	or	without	remuneration,	with	any	 other	organization	without	TCS’	prior	written	approval.
For	executive	 directors	and	the	Managing	Director,	such	approval	must	be	obtained	 from	the	Board.
Values,	Ethics	and	 compliance6 Over	the	last	five	decades,	TCS	has	consistently	demonstrated	 very	principled	conduct	and	has	earned	its	reputation	for	trust	and	 integrity	while	building	a	highly	successful	global	business.
The	Company’s	core	values	are:	Leading	Change,	Integrity,	Respect	 for	the	Individual,	Excellence,	and	Learning	and	Sharing.
The	TCoC	serves	as	a	moral	guide	and	a	governing	framework	for	 responsible	corporate	citizenship.
It	sets	out	guidelines	on	various	 topics	including	respect	for	human	rights,	prohibition	of	bribery	and	 corruption,	recognition	of	employees’	freedom	of	association,	and	 avoidance	of	conflicts	of	interest.
Every	employee	is	required	to	sign	the	TCoC	at	the	time	of	joining	 the	Company.
Annual	refresher	courses	are	mandated	to	ensure	 continued	awareness	of	the	Code.
Further,	frequent	communications	 from	the	leadership	reiterate	the	importance	of	the	company	values	 and	the	TCoC.
3	GRI	2-15	 4	GRI	2-11	 5 https://www.tcs.com/tata-code-of-conduct  6	GRI	2-12	 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Customers	are	made	aware	of	the	TCoC	principles	in	contract	 discussions,	and	through	inclusion	of	specific	clauses	in	proposals	and	 contracts.
Employees	can	raise	ethics	concerns	on	Ultimatix	–	the	intranet	 portal	of	the	Company,	which	are	investigated	and	tracked	to	closure	 by	the	HR	department.
Employees	and	other	stakeholders	can	also	 report	any	non-compliance	to	the	TCoC	or	to	the	laws	of	the	land	by	 senior	executives	directly	to	the	Chairman	of	the	Audit	Committee	 under	the	Whistle	blower	Policy	without	fear	of	retaliation.
Information	about	these	channels	is	communicated	to	employees	as	 part	of	the	mandatory	training	modules.
Compliance	to	laws	of	the	countries	in	which	we	operate,	as	well	as	 global	legislation	such	as	Foreign	Corrupt	Practices	Act,	Bribery	Act,	 2010	is	monitored	through	formal	compliance	procedures	led	by	 the	corporate	compliance	office.
Changes	to	legislation	are	closely	 monitored,	risks	are	evaluated	and	effectively	managed	across	our	 operations.
Governance,	Risk	and	Compliance	are	overseen	by	the	Chief	 Compliance	Officer,	Chief	Risk	Officer	and	the	Chief	HR	Officer	who	 report	to	the	Chief	Operating	Officer	and	Executive	Director	  (COO	and	ED),	and	CEO	and	MD	respectively.
At	the	apex	level,	 the	Audit	Committee	headed	by	an	Independent	Director	oversees	 compliance	to	the	TCoC,	Anti-Bribery	and	Anti-Corruption	Policy	 and	Gift	and	Hospitality	Policy.
and	to	external	regulations.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Corporate Governance Report  |  140 7 8 Material Topic TCS’ Approach Tax	Strategy7 TCS	is	committed	to	comply	with	the	applicable	laws	and	regulations,	 and	believes	in	reporting	to	the	respective	tax	authority,	relevant	 information	that	is	complete	and	accurate,	in	a	timely	manner.
TCS	does	not	engage	in	aggressive	and	contrived	tax	planning	or	 tax	structuring	for	the	purpose	of	gaining	tax	advantages.
TCS’s	tax	 policy	is	to	optimize	the	tax	cost,	avail	tax	incentives	where	available,	 while	achieving	100	percent	compliance	with	the	spirit	as	well	as	 the	letter	of	the	tax	laws	and	regulations	in	all	countries	in	which	 it	operates.
Compliance	is	achieved	through	a	robust	compliance	 reporting	and	monitoring	process,	with	a	strong	governance	on	 minimizing	the	tax	risk.
TCS	has	zero	tolerance	towards	tax	evasion,	 or	the	facilitation	of	tax	evasion,	by	itself	or	by	its	employees	or	 vendors.
TCS	maintains	open	and	collaborative	relationships	with	governments	 and	tax	authorities	worldwide.
Where	appropriate,	TCS	seeks	advance	 clearance	from	tax	authorities	on	the	proposed	tax	treatment	of	 transactions,	helping	pre-empt	future	disputes.

Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report,  highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has  flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure) 31   TCS has set forth its new carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse  gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 base year),  and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030.
The new goal is after having achieved  the previous target of reducing its specific carbon footprint by half by 2020 (versus  baseline year FY 2008), ahead of schedule.
N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director, TCS32: “Our net zero goal underlines  our renewed commitment to environmental stewardship.
T o curb emissions and  limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to  pre-industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models  and aim for sustainable growth.
We are in a unique position to combine our purpose- driven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but  also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions  for a sustainable future,”    At the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is improved energy  efficiency through the addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate  portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever Energy™,  which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across  campuses.
TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth  from campus expansion, and brings down emissions related to employee commutes  and business travel.
Other elements of the company’s net zero aspiration include  greater use of renewable sources of energy and carbon removal offsets.
Enivronmental targets and achievements are part of Natural Capital section, which is  on Page 31 of Integrated Annual Report.

From data privacy aspects, TCS’ commitment to privacy is espoused in its TCS Global Privacy Policy.
This is accessible at https://www.tcs.com/privacy-policy-commitment.
TCS has defined and implemented a Global Privacy policy that is applicable to all its legal entities, branches, lines of businesses and functions.
The global privacy policy is  a “gold standard of privacy” addressing applicable privacy regulations and based on inputs from industry bodies dealing with privacy.
100 GRI 2-23 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  |  231  The Global Privacy policy covers all stakeholders  across the value chain  including – employees  (full-time and contracted), customers, partners,  vendors/suppliers, and any other stakeholder  whose Personal Data is processed.
All third  parties (vendors/suppliers) are engaged /  contracted with adequate due diligence, and  commitment towards privacy obligations.
From a cyber security aspect, TCS has  implemented cutting edge security tools to  protect itself from external as well as internal  threats.
TCS has moved to a proactive early detection  approach.
Any approach to protect an  organization from threats, needs to focus  on all the risks and learnings from various  attacks, understanding the modus operandi  of the attacker and ensure that adequate  processes and latest in technology are  implemented to protect and provide proactive  detection capabilities.
TCS has implemented a  comprehensive threat intelligence framework  to proactively identify external threats as they  unfold globally, be it a ransomware propagation,  a nation state actor group, attackers for purely  monetary gain etc.
The threat intelligence  framework includes gathering intel on external  threats by means of commercial, government,  open source and vendor security feeds, threat  hunting in dark web, analyse new attack patterns  and constantly monitoring the publication of  vulnerabilities or various tools and software  in use in the organization.
The threat intel  information is processed in TCS’ AI/ML based  correlation tools and automated scripts ensure  that the indicators of compromise from the  threat feeds are automictically blocked on the  perimeter devices.
TCS has also rearchitected its network and  has implemented tools in tandem to work in  a defence in depth model to provide a holistic  protection against threat vectors/actors.
The defence in depth model has a strong  multi-layered perimeter setup consisting  of Next Gen Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention  Systems, DDoS attack protection for critical  resources, Web Application Firewalls, Advanced  malware protection and other email gateway  security controls.
TCS network design is  compartmentalized for every customer and  critical resources to ensure that the services  provided to each customer remains isolated.
This network design ensures that if there is an  impact at one customer end, say a ransomware  attack on a customer network, the segregated  network along with the company’s incident  response process ensures that there is no  impact to other network segments.
In addition to the perimeter defences, TCS has  implemented technical controls and processes  within the network to protect the information  resources.
T ools based on machine learning that  can detect and prevent known and unknown  ransomware, malware and active intruder  attempts to exploit like lateral movement,  privilege escalation or credential dumping in  addition to many other malicious actions.
AI/ ML tools that can detect behaviour anomalies  of users.
T ools that can correlate audit logs  from various sources.
Alerts from these tools  are monitored 24x7x365 by the TCS Cyber  Security Operations Center.
TCS has also implanted a strong vulnerability  management program which includes  proactively identifying vulnerabilities in its  network and systems by conducting periodic  vulnerability assessments, penetration tests and  red team exercises.

In our opinion and to the best of our information  and according to the explanations given to us, the  aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the  information required by the Companies Act, 2013  (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and  fair view in conformity with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state  of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2022, of its  consolidated profit and other comprehensive loss,  consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash  flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section  143(10) of the Act.
Our responsibilities under  those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements section of our report.
We are  independent of the Group in accordance with the  ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit  of the consolidated financial statements in terms  of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant  provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence  obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated  financial statements.
Key Audit Matters Key audit matters (‘KAM’) are those matters that, in  our professional judgment, were of most significance  in our audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period.
These matters were addressed  in the context of our audit of the consolidated  financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate  opinion on these matters.
Independent Auditor’s Report Consolidated  Financial Statements Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  234 Description of Key Audit Matter The Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit  Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price  contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using  the percentage of completion computed as per  the input method based on the Group’s estimate  of contract costs (Refer Note 5(a) and Note 12 to  the consolidated financial statements).
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price  contracts where the percentage of completion is  used as a Key Audit Matter since – • there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud  risk around the accuracy and existence  of revenues recognised considering the  customised and complex nature of these  contracts and significant inputs of IT systems; • application of revenue recognition accounting  standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from  Contracts with customers) is complex and  involves a number of key judgments and  estimates in mainly identifying performance  obligations, related transaction price and  estimating the future cost-to-completion of  these contracts, which is used to determine  the percentage of completion of the relevant  performance obligation;  Our audit procedures included the following: • Obtained an understanding of the systems,  processes and controls implemented by the  Group for recording and computing revenue  and the associated contract assets, unearned  and deferred revenue balances.
• Including involvement of our Information  technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:   Assessed the IT environment in which  the business systems operate and tested  system controls over computation of  revenue recognised; 	  T ested the IT controls over  appropriateness of cost and revenue  reports generated by the system;  	  T ested the controls pertaining to  allocation of resources and budgeting  systems which prevent the unauthorized  recording/changes to costs incurred; and 	   T ested on a random sampling basis the  controls relating to the estimation of  contract costs required to complete the  respective projects.
The Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit  • these contracts may involve onerous  obligations which requires critical assessment  of foreseeable losses to be made by the  Group; and • at year-end, significant amount of work in  progress (Contract assets), related to these  contracts are recognised on the balance  sheet.
• On selected specific and statistical samples  of contracts, we tested that the revenue  recognized is in accordance with the revenue  recognition accounting standard including –  	  Evaluated the identification of  performance obligations and the ascribed  transaction price; 	  For testing the Group’s computation  of the estimation of contract costs and  onerous obligations, if any.
We:   •  assessed that the estimates of costs  to complete were reviewed and  approved by appropriate designated  management personnel;   •  performed a retrospective analysis of  costs incurred with estimated costs  to identify significant variations and  challenged whether those variations  are required to be considered in  estimating the remaining costs to  complete the contract;    •  assessed the appropriateness of  work in progress (contract assets) on  balance sheet date by evaluating the  underlying documentation to identify  possible changes in estimated costs to  complete the remaining performance  obligations; and   •  inspected underlying documents and  performed analytics to determine  reasonableness of contract costs.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  235 Other Information The Holding Company’s management and Board of  Directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information  included in the Holding Company’s Annual Report,  but does not include the financial statements and our  auditor’s report thereon.
The Holding Company’s  annual report is expected to be made available to us  after the date of this auditor’s report Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated  financial statements, our responsibility is to read the  other information identified above when it becomes  available and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the  consolidated financial statements or our knowledge  obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.
When we read the Holding Company’s annual  report, if we conclude that there is a material  misstatement therein, we are required to  communicate the matter to those charged with  governance and take necessary actions, as applicable  under the relevant laws and regulations.
Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board  of Directors are responsible for the preparation  and presentation of these consolidated financial  statements in terms of the requirements of the Act  that give a true and fair view of the consolidated  state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other  comprehensive income, consolidated statement  of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows  of the Group in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, including the  Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section 133 of the Act.
The respective Management  and Board of Directors of the Companies included  in the Group are responsible for maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of  each Company and for preventing and detecting  frauds and other irregularities; the selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies;  making judgments and estimates that are reasonable  and prudent; and the design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of the consolidated financial statements that give  a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which  have been used for the purpose of preparation  of the consolidated financial statements by the  Management and Board of Directors of the Holding  Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements,  the respective Management and Board of  Directors of the companies included in the Group  are responsible for assessing the ability of each  Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and  using the going concern basis of accounting unless  the respective Board of Directors either intends to  liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the Companies  included in the Group are responsible for overseeing  the financial reporting process of each Company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  236 an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise  from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these  consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we  exercise professional judgment and maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We  also: • Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the consolidated financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher  than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal  control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control  relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances.
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing  our opinion on the internal financial controls  with reference to the consolidated financial  statements and the operating effectiveness of  such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by Management and Board of Directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of  Management and Board of Directors use of the  going concern basis of accounting in preparation  of consolidated financial statements and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a  material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt  on the appropriateness of this assumption.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in  our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements or,  if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify  our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the  audit evidence obtained up to the date of our  auditor’s report.
However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group to cease to  continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the consolidated financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  consolidated financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence  regarding the financial information of entities  within the Group to express an opinion on  the consolidated financial statements.
We  are responsible for the direction, supervision  and performance of the audit of financial  information of such entities included in the  consolidated financial statements.
We remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with  governance of the Holding Company and such other  Companies included in the consolidated financial  statements of which we are the independent  auditors regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  237 We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current  period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditors’ report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about the matter or when, in extremely rare  circumstances, we determine that a matter should  not be communicated in our report because the  adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably  be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits  of such communication.

These  responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls that were operating effectively for ensuring  the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  including adherence to the respective company’s  policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention  and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the  timely preparation of reliable financial information,  as required under the Companies Act, 2013  (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”).
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  the internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements based on our  audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with  the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing,  prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements.

Our audit involves performing procedures to  obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of  the internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements and their operating  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  242 effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements included obtaining an understanding  of internal financial controls with reference to  consolidated financial statements, assessing the  risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of the internal controls based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the consolidated financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with  reference to Consolidated Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with  reference to consolidated financial statements is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the preparation of consolidated financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements includes those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and  fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of  the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of consolidated  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial  Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial controls with reference to consolidated  financial statements, including the possibility of  collusion or improper management override of  controls, material misstatements due to error  or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk  that the internal financial controls with reference  to consolidated financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate.

LLP  Chartered Accountants Firm’s registration no:  101248W/W-100022 Rajesh Gopinathan  CEO and   Managing Director N Ganapathy Subramaniam  COO and Executive Director Amit Somani Partner  Membership No: 060154 Samir Seksaria  CFO Pradeep Manohar Gaitonde  Company Secretary Mumbai, April 11, 2022 Mumbai, April 11, 2022 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  252 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements 1) Corporate information  Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries  (collectively together with employee welfare trusts referred to as “the  Group”) provide IT services, consulting and business solutions and have been  partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation  journeys.
The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated  portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
This is  delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model  recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in  India.
The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort,  Mumbai - 400001.
As at March 31, 2022, Tata Sons Private Limited, the  holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.
The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the  year ended March 31, 2022 and authorised for issue on April 11, 2022.
2) Statement of compliance  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance  with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed  under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.
3) Basis of preparation  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost  basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which  are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration  given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.
All assets and liabilities  have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal  operating cycle.
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and  time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and  cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group  has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
The statement of cash flows have been prepared under indirect method,  whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts  or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or  financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating, investing and financing  activities of the Group are segregated.
The Group considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.
The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the  Indian Rupee (`).
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the  currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing  on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency denominated monetary  assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and  restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary  assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign  currencies are not retranslated.
The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated  financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  253 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements 4) Basis of consolidation  The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it.
The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is  exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the  entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over  relevant activities of the entity.
Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control  commences until the date control ceases.
The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated  from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal,  as appropriate.
The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a  line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and  expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss  of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The carrying amount of  the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to  reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.
Any difference  between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and  the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in  equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the  functional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange  rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Statement of profit and loss of  such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates.
T ranslation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation  reserve in the statement of changes in equity.
When a foreign operation is  disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or  joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to  that foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit  and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
5) Use of estimates and judgements  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the  recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management to  make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets  and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated  financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for  the periods presented.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
The Group uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation of its  consolidated financial statements: (a) Revenue recognition  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using   percentage-of-completion method.
The Group uses judgement to   estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to  determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.
(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment  The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the  end of each reporting period.
This reassessment may result in change in  depreciation expense in future periods.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  254 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements (c) Impairment of goodwill  The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs)  based on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions  and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated  future economic and regulatory conditions.
The estimated cash flows are  developed using internal forecasts.
The discount rates used for the CGUs  represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market  returns of comparable companies.
(d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments  When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in  the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active  markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs to these models are taken from  observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree  of judgement is required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of  financial instruments.
(e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets  The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in  the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is  exercised while determining the provision for income tax.
A deferred tax asset  is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be  available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses  can be utilised.
Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the  carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.
(f) Provisions and contingent liabilities  The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result  of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligations.
These provisions are reviewed at the end of each  reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities.
Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises  from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources  will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount  cannot be made.
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the  consolidated financial statements.
(g) Employee benefits  The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit  requires the Group to use assumptions.
These assumptions have been  explained under employee benefits note.
(h) Leases  The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the  requirements of Ind AS 116.
Identification of a lease requires significant  judgement.
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term  (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a  lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  255 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered  by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to  exercise that option.
In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to  exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate  a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an  economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease,  or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.
The Group revises the  lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.
The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate  specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar  characteristics.
(i) Impact of COVID-19 (pandemic)  The Group has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19  in preparation of these consolidated financial statements, including but  not limited to its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption,  recoverable values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue  recognition owing to changes in cost budgets of fixed price contracts,  impact on leases and impact on effectiveness of its hedges.
The Group has  carried out this assessment based on available internal and external sources  of information upto the date of approval of these consolidated financial  statements and believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to  these consolidated financial statements and expects to recover the carrying  amount of its assets.
The impact of COVID-19 on the consolidated financial  statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of  these consolidated financial statements owing to the nature and duration of  COVID-19.
6) Recent pronouncements  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments  to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules as issued from time to time.
On March 23, 2022, MCA amended the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable  from April 1, 2022, as below:  Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework  The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying  the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework  for Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual  Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the  acquisition date.
These changes do not significantly change the requirements  of Ind AS 103.
The Group does not expect the amendment to have any  significant impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use  The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of  property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced  while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use.
Instead, an  entity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss.
The  Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact in its recognition  of its property, plant and equipment in its financial statements.
Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract  The amendments specify that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises  the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’.
Costs that relate directly to a  contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  256 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate  directly to fulfilling contracts.
The amendment is essentially a clarification and  the Group does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact in  its financial statements.
Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)  The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the   ‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial  liability.
The Group does not expect the amendment to have any significant  impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 116 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)  The amendments remove the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold  improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion  regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how  lease incentives were described in that illustration.
The Group does not expect  the amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.
7) Business combinations  The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method  of accounting.
Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated  statement of profit and loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are  recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is  recognised as goodwill.
Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities  exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net  assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at  fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the  acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made  on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying  amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial  recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in  equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that  are under common control are accounted at historical cost.
The difference  between any consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in  shareholders’ equity.
8) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments  Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a  party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and  liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
T ransaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities  (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial  recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to  the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset  and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the  Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  257 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  Cash and cash equivalents  The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible  into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change  in value to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
Financial assets at amortised cost  Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these  financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of  the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income  Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive  income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is  achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding  and selling financial assets.
The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent  changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other  comprehensive income.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they  are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive  income on initial recognition.
The transaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  method.
Equity instruments  An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets  of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued  by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.
Derivative accounting  • Instruments in hedging relationship   The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency  options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign  exchange risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of  the Company and its subsidiaries which are approved by their respective  Board of Directors.
The policies provide written principles on the use of  such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of  the Company and its subsidiaries.
The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at  the inception of the contract.
The Group determines the existence of an  economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated  with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception  and on an ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  258 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in  other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in  the statement of profit and loss.
The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated  hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and  accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and  designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value  of the option.
The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time  value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income  and accounted as a separate component of equity.
Such amounts are  reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged  items affect profit and loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any  gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated  in equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and  loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss.
Any  gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss  when the hedge becomes ineffective.
• Instruments not in hedging relationship   The Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an  economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The  change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement  of profit and loss.
Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset  or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit  losses to be measured through a loss allowance.
The Group recognises lifetime  expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not  constitute a financing transaction.
In determining the allowances for doubtful  trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing  the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision  matrix.
The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience  and is adjusted for forward looking information.
The expected credit loss  allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance  rates used in the provision matrix.
For all other financial assets, expected  credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected  credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if  the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial  recognition.

Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial  assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost  also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented.
Fair  value measurement of lease liabilities is not required.
Fair value of investments carried  at amortised cost is `1,672 crore and `332 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021,  respectively.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  267 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements (j) Fair value hierarchy  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are  used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and  consists of the following three levels:  • Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that  are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or  indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
• Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable  inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation  model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are  they based on available market data.
The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy  approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value  measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.
The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair  value on a recurring basis and financial assets that are not measured at fair  value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required): (` crore) As at March 31, 2022  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Financial assets Mutual fund units 1,874  -     -    1,874  Equity shares  -     -    36 36  Government bonds and securities 25,859  -     -    25,859  Certificate of deposits  99  -     -     99  (` crore)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Corporate bonds 1,252  -     -    1,252  Commercial papers 381  -     -     381  T reasury bills  990  990  Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  assets  -    388  -     388  30,455 388 36 30,879  Financial liabilities Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  liabilities   -     128  -     128   -    128  -    128  (` crore) As at March 31, 2021  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Financial assets Mutual fund units 4,849  -    55 4,904  Equity shares  -     -    38 38 Government bonds and securities 23,856  -     -    23,856  Corporate bonds 460  -     -    460  Commercial papers 136  -     -    136  Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  assets  -    495  -    495  29,301 495 93 29,889  Financial liabilities Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  liabilities   -    92  -    92   -    92  -    92  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  268 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets is as follows:  (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year 93 42 Additions during the year - 52 Fair value of investments - 4 Impairment in value of investments (4) (2) Other adjustments during the year (55) - T ranslation exchange difference 2 (3) Balance at the end of the year 36 93  (k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity  The Group’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies.
Given the  nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian  Rupee.
This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.
The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC)  to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Group  which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency  fluctuations.
Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the  Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward,  currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally  a bank.
The following are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been  designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign currency As at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021 No.

As at   March 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of outstanding contracts aggregated   to `46,392 crore and `37,615 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of   these contracts have a net gain of `158 crore and `242 crore.
Exchange gain of `645 crore and `490 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency  options and futures contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting have been  recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the years ended   March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Net foreign exchange gain include gain of `111 crore and loss of `189 crore  transferred from cash flow hedging reserve for the years ended March 31, 2022 and  2021, respectively.
Net loss on derivative instruments of `26 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve  as at March 31, 2022, is expected to be transferred to the statement of profit and  loss by March 31, 2023.
The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow  variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2022.
Following table summarises approximate gain / (loss) on Group’s other comprehensive  income on account of appreciation / depreciation of the underlying foreign currencies: (` crore) As at  March 31, 2022 As at  March 31, 2021 10% Appreciation of the underlying foreign  currencies (387) (306) 10% Depreciation of the underlying foreign  currencies 2,034 1,906 (l) Financial risk management  The Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange  rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact  the fair value of its financial instruments.
The Group has a risk management  policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities.
The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus  of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the  financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial  performance of the Group.
Market risk  Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial  instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Such changes  in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign  currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market  changes.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of  foreign currency exchange rate risk.
• Foreign currency exchange rate risk   The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential  impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other  comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references  more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in  a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group  operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in  exchange rates in those countries.
The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments  primarily to hedge foreign exchange.
Further, any movement in the  functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  270 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements major foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international  business.
The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It hedges a part of  these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk  management policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the  net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign  exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective  functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its  subsidiaries.
The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures  for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of  the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity.
Further the exposure  as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts  entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).
The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign  currency exposure as at March 31, 2022: (` crore) USD EUR GBP Others Net financial assets 2,900 165 84 1,234  Net financial liabilities (8,589) (437) (1,290) (421)   10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency  of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect  to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the  Group’s profit before taxes by approximately `635 crore for the year  ended March 31, 2022.
The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign  currency exposure as at March 31, 2021:  (` crore) USD EUR GBP Others Net financial assets 3,194 155 101 1,129  Net financial liabilities (41) (573) (354) (411)   10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency  of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect  to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the  Group’s profit before taxes by approximately `320 crore for the year  ended March 31, 2021.
• Interest rate risk   The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing  investments.
Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to interest  rate risk.
Credit risk  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay  or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk  encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration  of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled  by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous  basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals  for credit.
Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk  principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial  instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial  assets.
Inter-corporate deposits of `6,377 crore are with a financial institution  having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies.
Bank deposits  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  271 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements include an amount of `6,727 crore held with four Indian banks having high  credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s  total bank deposits as at March 31, 2022.
None of the other financial  instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.
• Exposure to credit risk   The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents  the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk was  `1,05,498 crore and `94,201 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021,  respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with  banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loan, contract assets  and other financial assets.
The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer  contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and  contract assets as at March 31, 2022 and 2021.
• Geographic concentration of credit risk   Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of  allowances) and contract assets is as follows: As at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America 43.79 44.69 41.08 41.83 India 15.51 13.83 20.31 18.79 United Kingdom 16.47 16.86 16.37 16.75   Geographical concentration of trade receivables and contract assets is  allocated based on the location of the customers.
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables   for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, was `123 crore and  `190 crore respectively.
The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful  trade receivables is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended   March 31, 2022 Y ear ended   March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year 1,289 1,137  Change during the year 123 190 Bad debts written off (83) (34) T ranslation exchange difference 4 (4) Balance at the end of the year 1,333 1,289    Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial  obligations.

Group as a lessee  The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a  lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of  the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate  standalone price of the non-lease components.
The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the  underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date.
The  cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the  amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease  payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives  received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be  incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or  restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located.
The right-of-use  asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation,  accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of  the lease liability.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the   straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of   lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The estimated useful lives of  right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,  plant and equipment.
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever  there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease  payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease.
The lease  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  275 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that  rate can be readily determined.
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the  Group uses incremental borrowing rate.
For leases with reasonably similar  characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing  rate for the portfolio as a whole.
The lease payments shall include fixed  payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price  of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term  reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
The lease  liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to  reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect  the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed  lease payments.
The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of  lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset  and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification.
Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and  there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the  Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement  of profit and loss.
The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases  to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less  and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
The lease payments  associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line  basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor  At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either  an operating lease or a finance lease.
The Group recognises lease payments  received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the  lease term.
In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the  lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on  the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
When the Group is an intermediate  lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease  separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference  to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to  the underlying asset.
If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group  applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an  operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group  applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the  consideration in the contract.

The total cash outflow for leases is `2,228 crore and `2,312 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including cash outflow for short term and low  value leases.
The Group has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement  of lease liabilities.
The present value of future cash outflows for such extension periods  is `773 crore and `708 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Lease contracts entered by the Group majorly pertains for buildings taken on lease  to conduct its business in the ordinary course.
The Group does not have any lease  restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.
10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities  (a) Property, plant and equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price  and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working  condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than  freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.
Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line  basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful  lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual  values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any  change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  277 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below: T ype of asset Useful lives Buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Plant and equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Office equipment 2-5 years Electrical installations 4-10 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years  Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction  and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be  recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher  of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an  individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are  largely independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable  amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset  belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than  its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to  its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.

(b) Goodwill  Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date  of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net  fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less  accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment  annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value  of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually,  or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.
The financial  projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider  the increase in economic uncertainties due to COVID-19, reassessment  of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at  terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis.
If the  recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment  loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of  the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Goodwill consists of the following: (` crore)  As at  March 31, 2022 As at  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year 1,798 1,710 T ranslation exchange difference (11) 88 Balance at the end of the year 1,787 1,798   Goodwill of `646 crore and `660 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021,  respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business in France.
The estimated  value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50%  annual growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years  and discount rate of 9.30%.
An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation  to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long  term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify  any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would  decrease below its carrying amount.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  280 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  The remaining amount of goodwill of `1,141 crore and `1,138 crore as  at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, (relating to different CGUs  individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of  the related CGUs and the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their  carrying amounts.
(c) Other intangible assets  Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are  measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.
Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software  licences and customer-related intangibles.
Following table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated  useful lives: T ype of asset Useful lives Rights under licensing agreement and  software licences Lower of licence period and 2-5 years Customer-related intangibles 3 years  Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its  economic useful life.
Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there  is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
If any  such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher of the fair value less  cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis  unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of  those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined  for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

12) Revenue recognition  The Group earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and  business solutions.
The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered,  integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  285 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
• Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on  output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of  transactions processed, etc.
• Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services  contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide services is  recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over  the period of performance.
• In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting  with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of  the performance obligation.
The contract costs used in computing the  revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
• Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and  manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront  at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the  customer.
In cases where implementation and / or customisation services  rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and  revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
• Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at  the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
• The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party  equipment or software.
In such cases, revenue for supply of such third  party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether  the Group is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer.
The  Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when  it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is  acting as an agent.
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the  consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits,  performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in  the contract with the customer.
Revenue also excludes taxes collected from  customers.
The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer  multiple products and services to a customer.
The Group assesses the  products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance  obligations in the contract.
Identification of distinct performance obligation  involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the  customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.
Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the  contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance  obligation.
The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer  consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume  discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives.
The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time  value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.
Any  consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price,  unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer.
The  estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price  only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the  amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed  at the end of each reporting period.
The Group allocates the elements of  variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  286 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.
The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance  obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time.
The Group  considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services  are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence  of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use  of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the  customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain  software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation.
Such costs are  amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is  less.
The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in  particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used  to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to  be recovered.
Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned  over billings on contracts.
Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables  (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive  cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there  are billings in excess of revenues.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance  based payments and / or milestone based progress payments.
Invoices are  payable within contractually agreed credit period.
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract  provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a  contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract  specification and requirements.
The Group reviews modification to contract  in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price  could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an  existing obligation could undergo a change.
In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of  services, industry verticals and geography.
Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Consultancy services 1,90,289 1,62,508 Sale of equipment and software licences 1,465 1,669  1,91,754 1,64,177  Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included  in segment information (Refer note 19).
While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be  recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance  obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise  those revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  287 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price  allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which  pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value  transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based  and event based contracts.
Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to  variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of  contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in  currency rates, tax laws etc).
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated  to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,13,868 crore  out of which 56.54% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year  and the balance thereafter.
No consideration from contracts with customers is  excluded from the amount mentioned above.
Changes in contract assets are as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year 4,080 4,489  Invoices raised that were included in the  contract assets balance at the beginning of the  year (3,150) (3,496) Increase due to revenue recognised during the  year, excluding amounts billed during the year 3,457 2,985  T ranslation exchange difference 32 102  Balance at the end of the year 4,419 4,080   Changes in unearned and deferred revenue are as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year 4,847 3,612  Revenue recognised that was included in the  unearned and deferred revenue balance at the  beginning of the year (3,251) (3,010) Increase due to invoicing during the year,  excluding amounts recognised as revenue  during the year  3,094 4,182  T ranslation exchange difference 55 63 Balance at the end of the year 4,745 4,847   Reconciliation of revenue recognised with the contracted price is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Contracted price 1,94,777 1,66,917  Reductions towards variable consideration  components (3,023) (2,740) Revenue recognised 1,91,754 1,64,177   The reduction towards variable consideration comprises of volume discounts, service  level credits, etc.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  288 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements 13) Other income  Dividend income is recorded when the right to receive payment is established.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and  losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan  assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with  a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in  which they occur.
Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised  as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment  occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or  termination benefits.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents  the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value  of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the  present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the  scheme.
The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund  (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined  benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans  Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when  employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Group provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other  than Company managed fund) and foreign defined contribution plans to its  employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  289 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  Short-term employee benefits  All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering  the service are classified as short-term employee benefits.
Benefits such  as salaries, wages etc.
and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised  in the period in which the employee renders the related service.
A liability  is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present  legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service  provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Compensated absences  Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months  after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related  services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months  after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services  are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the  defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2022.
The Group   is expected to contribute `57 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending March 31, 2023 comprising domestic component of   `6 crore and foreign component of `51 crore.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  295 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined  benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase.
The  sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible  changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting  period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit  obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Increase of 0.50% (372) (378) Decrease of 0.50% 422 421   If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined  benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Increase of 0.50% 200 276 Decrease of 0.50% (188) (260)  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the  actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the  change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the  assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of  the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit  Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that  applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the  balance sheet.
Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the  consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk  and return profiles.
Investment and contribution policies are integrated within  this study.
The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2022  as follows: (` crore) Y ear ending March 31, Defined benefit obligations 2023  533  2024 449 2025 478 2026 463 2027 478 2028-2032 2,477  Provident fund  In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy  Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident  fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined  rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the  investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees.
This plan is  a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a  rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared  by Government administered provident fund.
A part of the Company’s  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  296 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  The principal assumptions used in determining the present value obligations of  interest guarantee under the deterministic approach are as follows: As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Discount rate 7.00% 6.50% Average remaining tenure of investment  portfolio 8 years 8 years Guaranteed rate of return 8.10% 8.50%  The Group expensed `1,383 crore and `1,085 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards provident fund.
Superannuation  All eligible employees on Indian payroll are entitled to benefits under  Superannuation, a defined contribution plan.
The Group makes monthly  contributions until retirement or resignation of the employee.
The Group  recognises such contributions as an expense when incurred.
The Group has  no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.
The Group expensed `383 crore and `366 crore for the years ended   March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards Employees’ Superannuation  Fund.
Foreign defined contribution plan  The Group expensed `1,796 crore and `1,458 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards foreign defined contribution  plans.
contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund.
The  contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are  recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on  the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the  assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as  the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than  the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the  expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident  fund.
All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to  receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee  and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government  administered provident fund plan.
A part of the company’s contribution is  transferred to Government administered pension fund.
This plan is a defined  contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly  contributions made to the fund.
The contributions made to the fund are  recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.
The details of fund and plan assets are given below: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Fair value of plan assets 22,814 20,003  Present value of defined benefit obligations (22,814) (20,003) Net excess / (shortfall)  -    -     The plan assets have been primarily invested in Government securities and  corporate bonds.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  297 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements 15)  Cost recognition  Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and have been classified  according to their nature.
The costs of the Group are broadly categorised in employee benefit expenses,  cost of equipment and software licences, depreciation and amortisation  expense and other expenses.
Other expenses mainly include fees to external  consultants, facility expenses, travel expenses, communication expenses,  bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade receivables  and advances (net) and other expenses.
Other expenses are aggregation of  costs which are individually not material such as commission and brokerage,  recruitment and training, entertainment, etc.
(a) Cost of equipment and software licences  Cost of equipment and software licences consist of the following: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Raw materials, sub-assemblies and components  consumed 29  14  Equipment and software licences purchased 1,137 1,447  1,166 1,461  Finished goods and work-in-progress Opening stock -*  1  Less: Closing stock 3 -*  (3)  1  1,163 1,462   *Represents value less than `0.50 crore.

Current and deferred taxes  are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to  items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income taxes  The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the  Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas.
The current tax payable  by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable  on worldwide income after taking credit for tax relief available for export  operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is  computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in  which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available  for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide  income.
The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed  based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective  jurisdiction in which it operates.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the  balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision  arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit  intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
Deferred income taxes  Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred  income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable  temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the  initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or  loss at the time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary  differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each  reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary  differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with  investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary  difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference  will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax  rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary  differences are expected to be received or settled.
For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have  been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences  between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes  levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle  its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  299 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements  Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance  with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against  future current income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred  tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it  is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be  realised.

These tax holidays  are available for a period of fifteen years from the date of commencement of  operations.
Under the SEZ scheme, the unit which begins providing services  on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for deductions of 100% of profits  or gains derived from export of services for the first five years, 50% of such  profits or gains for a further period of five years and 50% of such profits  or gains for the balance period of five years subject to fulfilment of certain  conditions.

In respect of certain foreign subsidiaries,  business losses can be carried forward indefinitely unless there is a substantial  change in the ownership.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax  credit entitlements which do not qualify for recognition as per the applicable  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  302 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements accounting standards.
These unexpired business losses will expire based on the  year of origination as follows: (` crore) March 31, Unabsorbed business losses 2023 2 2024 7 2025 4 2026 2 2027 - Thereafter 116  131  Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Tata Consultancy Services Limited is liable  to pay Minimum Alternate Tax in the tax holiday period.
MAT paid can be  carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future  tax liabilities.
MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset  can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit  associated with the asset will be realised.
Deferred tax liability on temporary differences of `6,177 crore as at  March 31, 2022, associated with investments in subsidiaries, has not been  recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to  reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.
Direct tax contingencies   The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax  authorities in India and in some of the other jurisdictions where they operate.
The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction,  computation or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation  of fees for services received.
The Company and its subsidiaries have  recognised contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct  tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions of `1,652 crore and `955 crore  as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
These demand orders are being  contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management  evaluation and advise of tax consultants.
In respect of tax contingencies of  `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, not  included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller  of TCS e-Serve Limited.
The Group periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax  authorities related to the Group’s operations in the jurisdictions it operates in.
The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that  any consequent income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities  will not succeed on ultimate resolution.
The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending  on tax jurisdiction.
The major tax jurisdictions of Tata Consultancy Services  Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom.
In India,  tax filings from fiscal 2018 are generally subject to examination by the tax  authorities.
In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation  applies to fiscals 2017 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation  vary by state.
In United Kingdom, the statute of limitation generally applies to  fiscal 2018 and earlier.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  303 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements 18) Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing profit or loss attributable  to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of  equity shares outstanding during the period.

The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the  Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.
The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable  segments.
The business segments comprise: 1) Banking, Financial Services   and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Retail and Consumer Business,   4) Communication, Media and T echnology, 5) Life Sciences and Healthcare  and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and  Products.
Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under  each reportable segment.
Expenses which are not directly identifiable to  each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated  revenue of the segment or manpower efforts.
All other expenses which are  not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable  expenses.
The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst  segments.
Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any  forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation.
Hence assets  and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments.

The Company and its subsidiaries have  demands amounting to `568 crore and `556 crore as at   March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from various indirect tax  authorities which are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries  based on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.

In addition to above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation  (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court  of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to  and download of their confidential information and use thereof in the  development of the Company’s product MedMantra.
In April 2016, the  Company received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of  `7,115 crore (US $940 million) to Epic which was thereafter reduced  by the T rial Court to `3,179 crore (US $420 million).
Pursuant to  reaffirmation of the District Court order in March 2019, the Company  filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order.
Epic also  filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge  of `757 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,514 crore   (US $200 million) in punitive damages.
On August 20, 2020, the Appeals  Court vacated the award of `2,119 crore (US $280 million) in punitive  damages considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and  remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess  and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,060 crore    (US $140 million), affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the  jury’s award of `757 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages  for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company,  and affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of  `1,060 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of  the comparative analysis by the Company.
The proceedings for assessing  punitive damages have been remanded back to the District Court.
Both  the Company and Epic have filed their briefs at the District Court in  relation to punitive damages.
The matter is under consideration by the  District Court.
On April 8, 2021, Epic approached the Supreme Court  seeking review of the order of the Appeals Court vacating the award of  `2,119 crore (US $280 million) towards punitive damages and remanding  back to District Court with an instruction to reassess the punitive  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Consolidated Financial Statements  |  306 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements damages, to no more than `1,060 crore (US $140 million).
On   March 21, 2022, Supreme Court denied Epic’s petition seeking review   of the order.
The Company will continue to pursue all legal options  available in the matter.
Considering all the facts and various legal  precedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided  `1,218 crore (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement  of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30, 2020.
This was presented as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement  of profit and loss.
Pursuant to US Court procedures, a Letter of Credit has been made  available to Epic for `3,331 crore (US $440 million) as financial security  in order to stay execution of the judgement pending post-appeal  proceedings and conclusion.
• Letter of comfort   The Company has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities  availed by its subsidiaries.
As per the terms of letter of comfort, the  Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or  indirectly in the subsidiary and provide such managerial, technical and  financial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the  subsidiary.
The amounts assessed as contingent liability do not include interest that could  be claimed by counter parties.

In our opinion and to the best of our information  and according to the explanations given to us, the  aforesaid standalone financial statements give the  information required by the Companies Act, 2013  (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give a  true and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, of the state of  affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2022, and  its profit and other comprehensive loss, changes in  equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that  date.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section  143(10) of the Act.
Our responsibilities under  those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements section of our report.
We  are independent of the Company in accordance  with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India together with the  ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit  of the standalone financial statements under the  provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and  we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements and the Code of  Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained  by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our opinion on the standalone financial  statements.
Key Audit Matters Key audit matters (‘KAM’) are those matters that, in  our professional judgment, were of most significance  in our audit of the standalone financial statements of  the current period.
These matters were addressed in  the context of our audit of the standalone financial  statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters.
Standalone Financial  Statements Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  319 Description of Key Audit Matter Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts The Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price  contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using  the percentage of completion computed as  per the input method based on the Company’s  estimate of contract costs (Refer Note 4(a) and  Note 10 to the standalone financial statements).
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price  contracts where the percentage of completion is  used as a Key Audit Matter since – • there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud  risk around the accuracy and existence  of revenues recognised considering the  customised and complex nature of these  contracts and significant inputs of IT systems; • application of revenue recognition accounting  standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from  Contracts with customers) is complex and  involves a number of key judgments and  estimates mainly in identifying performance  obligations, related transaction price and  estimating the future cost-to-completion of  these contracts, which is used to determine  the percentage of completion of the relevant  performance obligation; Our audit procedures included the following: • Obtained an understanding of the systems,  processes and controls implemented by  the Company for recording and computing  revenue and the associated contract assets,  unearned and deferred revenue balances.
• Including involvement of our Information  technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:   Assessed the IT environment in which  the business systems operate and tested  system controls over computation of  revenue recognised;   T ested the IT controls over  appropriateness of cost and revenue  reports generated by the system;   T ested the controls pertaining to  allocation of resources and budgeting  systems which prevent the unauthorized  recording/changes to costs incurred; and   T ested on a random sampling basis the  controls relating to the estimation of  contract costs required to complete the  respective projects.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter • these contracts may involve onerous  obligations which requires critical assessment  of foreseeable losses to be made by the  Company; and • at year-end, significant amount of work in  progress (Contract assets), related to these  contracts are recognised on the balance  sheet.
• On selected specific and statistical samples  of contracts, we tested that the revenue  recognized is in accordance with the revenue  recognition accounting standard including– 	  Evaluated the identification of  performance obligations and the ascribed  transaction price; 	  For testing Company’s computation of the  estimation of contract costs and onerous  obligations, if any.
We:   • assessed that the estimates of costs  to complete were reviewed and  approved by appropriate designated  management personnel;   • performed a retrospective analysis of  costs incurred with estimated costs  to identify significant variations and  challenged whether those variations  are required to be considered in  estimating the remaining costs to  complete the contract;   • assessed the appropriateness of  work in progress (contract assets) on  balance sheet date by evaluating the  underlying documentation to identify  possible changes in estimated costs to  complete the remaining performance  obligations; and   • inspected underlying documents and  performed analytics to determine  reasonableness of contract costs.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  320 Other Information The Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the other information.
The other  information comprises the information included in  the Company’s annual report, but does not include  the financial statements and our auditors’ report  thereon.
The Company’s annual report is expected  to be made available to us after the date of this  auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements  does not cover the other information and we will not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone  financial statements, our responsibility is to read the  other information identified above when it becomes  available and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the  standalone financial statements or our knowledge  obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.
When we read the Company’s annual report, if  we conclude that there is a material misstatement  therein, we are required to communicate the  matter to those charged with governance and take  necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant  laws and regulations.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  Management and Board of Directors are responsible  for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters  related to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless the Board of  Directors either intends to liquidate the Company  or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for  overseeing the Company’s financial reporting  process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the standalone financial statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue  an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise  from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these  standalone financial statements.
Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial  Statements The Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the matters stated in Section  134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation  of these standalone financial statements that give  a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in  equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance  with the accounting principles generally accepted  in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards  (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act.
This  responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions  of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the  Company and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the standalone  financial statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  321 As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we  exercise professional judgment and maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We  also: • Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the standalone financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher  than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal  control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control  relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances.
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Company has adequate  internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by the Management and Board of  Directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the  Management and Board of Directors use  of the going concern basis of accounting in  preparation of standalone financial statements  and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to  events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the Company’s ability to continue  as a going concern.
If we conclude that a  material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditor’s report to  the related disclosures in the standalone  financial statements or, if such disclosures  are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence  obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause  the Company to cease to continue as a going  concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the standalone financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  standalone financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with  governance regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant  audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the  standalone financial statements of the current  period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure  about the matter or when, in extremely rare  circumstances, we determine that a matter should  not be communicated in our report because the  adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably  be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits  of such communication.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material  respects, adequate internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements and  such internal financial controls were operating  effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the  internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements criteria established  by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the  “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’  Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of  Directors are responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements based on the  criteria established by the Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in  the Guidance Note.
These responsibilities include  the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds  and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of  reliable financial information, as required under the  Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements based on our  audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with  the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing,  prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements were established and maintained and  whether such controls operated effectively in all  material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to  obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of  the internal financial controls with reference to  standalone financial statements and their operating  effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls  with reference to standalone financial statements  included obtaining an understanding of such internal  financial controls, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the  design and operating effectiveness of internal control  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  330 based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected  depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of  the standalone financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Standalone Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with  reference to standalone financial statements is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the preparation of standalone financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal  financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements include those policies and  procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and  fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of  the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of standalone  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance with authorisations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the  company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the standalone financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls with Reference to Standalone Financial  Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial controls with reference to standalone  financial statements, including the possibility of  collusion or improper management override of  controls, material misstatements due to error  or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls with reference to standalone financial  statements to future periods are subject to the risk  that the internal financial controls with reference  to standalone financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or  procedures may deteriorate.

As per our report of even date attached For and on behalf of the Board For B S R & Co. LLP  Chartered Accountants Firm’s registration no:  101248W/W-100022 Rajesh Gopinathan  CEO and   Managing Director N Ganapathy Subramaniam  COO and Executive Director Amit Somani Partner  Membership No: 060154 Samir Seksaria  CFO Pradeep Manohar Gaitonde  Company Secretary Mumbai, April 11, 2022 Mumbai, April 11, 2022 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  339 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements 1) Corporate information  Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS Limited” or “the  Company”) provides IT services, consulting and business solutions and  has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their  transformation journeys.
The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive  powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services  and solutions.
This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent  Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software  development.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in  India.
The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort,  Mumbai - 400001.
As at March 31, 2022, Tata Sons Private Limited, the  holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.
The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the  year ended March 31, 2022 and authorised for issue on April 11, 2022.
2) Statement of compliance  These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with  the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under  section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.
3) Basis of preparation  These standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost  basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which  are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration  given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.
All assets and liabilities  have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal  operating cycle.
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and  time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash  and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the  Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
The statement of cash flows have been prepared under indirect method,  whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash  nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts  or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or  financing cash flows.
The cash flows from operating, investing and financing  activities of the Company are segregated.
The Company considers all highly  liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and  are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.
These standalone financial statements have been prepared in Indian Rupee  (`) which is the functional currency of the Company.
Foreign currency  transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the  transaction.
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates  and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are  recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are  not retranslated.
The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the standalone  financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  340 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements 4) Use of estimates and judgements  The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with the  recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of  the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the  date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income  and expenses for the periods presented.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the  estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
The Company uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation  of its standalone financial statements: (a) Revenue recognition  Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of- completion method.
The Company uses judgement to estimate the future  cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of  completion of the performance obligation.
(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment  The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at  the end of each reporting period.
This reassessment may result in change in  depreciation expense in future periods.
(c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries  The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of  impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for  impairment.
If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.
(d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments  When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in  the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active  markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the  Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs to these models are taken from  observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree  of judgement is required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of  financial instruments.
(e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets  The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in  the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is  exercised while determining the provision for income tax.
A deferred tax asset  is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be  available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can  be utilised.
Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the  carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.
(f) Provisions and contingent liabilities  The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as  a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be  required to settle the obligations.
These provisions are reviewed at the end of  each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  341 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities.
Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation  arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not  wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises  from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources  will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount  cannot be made.
Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the  standalone financial statements.
(g) Employee benefits  The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit  requires the Company to use assumptions.
These assumptions have been  explained under employee benefits note.
(h) Leases  The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the  requirements of Ind AS 116.
Identification of a lease requires significant  judgement.
The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease  term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a  lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease  if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods  covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably  certain not to exercise that option.
In assessing whether the Company is  reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise  an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances  that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option  to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.
The  Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable  period of a lease.
The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate  specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar  characteristics.
(i) Impact of COVID-19 (pandemic)  The Company has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19 in  preparation of these standalone financial statements, including but not limited  to its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption, recoverable  values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue recognition  owing to changes in cost budgets of fixed price contracts, impact on leases  and impact on effectiveness of its hedges.
The Company has carried out this  assessment based on available internal and external sources of information  upto the date of approval of these standalone financial statements and  believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to these standalone  financial statements and expects to recover the carrying amount of its assets.
The impact of COVID-19 on the standalone financial statements may differ  from that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone financial  statements owing to the nature and duration of COVID-19.
5) Recent pronouncements  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments  to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules as issued from time to time.
On March 23, 2022, MCA amended the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable  from April 1, 2022, as below: Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  342 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework  The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying  the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework  for Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual  Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the  acquisition date.
These changes do not significantly change the requirements  of Ind AS 103.
The Company does not expect the amendment to have any  significant impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use  The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of  property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced  while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use.
Instead, an  entity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact in its  recognition of its property, plant and equipment in its financial statements.
Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract  The amendments specify that that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises  the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’.
Costs that relate directly to a  contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples  would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate  directly to fulfilling contracts.
The amendment is essentially a clarification and  the Company does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact  in its financial statements.
Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)  The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the   ‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial  liability.
The Company does not expect the amendment to have any significant  impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 116 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)  The amendments remove the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold  improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion  regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of  how lease incentives were described in that illustration.
The Company does  not expect the amendment to have any significant impact in its financial  statements.
6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments  Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes  a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and  liabilities are initially measured at fair value.
T ransaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities  (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial  recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights  to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset  and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity.
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the  Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  343 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  Cash and cash equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily  convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk  of change in value, to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist  of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.
Financial assets at amortised cost  Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these  financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these  assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of  the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income  Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive  income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is  achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding  and selling financial assets.
The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent  changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other  comprehensive income.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they  are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive  income on initial recognition.
The transaction costs directly attributable to the  acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Investment in subsidiaries  Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.
Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  method.
Equity instruments  An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets  of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued  by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue  cost.
Derivative accounting  • Instruments in hedging relationship   The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency  options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign  exchange risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies  of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors.
The  policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives  consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  344 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements   The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the  inception of the contract.
The Company determines the existence of an  economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated  with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception  and on an ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no longer  expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in  other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in  the statement of profit and loss.
The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated  hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and  accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option  and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value  of the option.
The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time  value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income  and accounted as a separate component of equity.
Such amounts are  reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged  items affect profit and loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any  gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated  in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit  and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss.
Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and  loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.
• Instruments not in hedging relationship   The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an  economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The  change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement  of profit and loss.
Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset  or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss  allowance.
The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract  assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing  transaction.
In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the  Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit  loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.
The provision  matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for  forward looking information.
The expected credit loss allowance is based on  the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the  provision matrix.

Fair  value measurement of lease liabilities is not required.
Fair value of investments carried  at amortised cost is `1,470 crore and `136 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021,  respectively.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  354 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements (k) Fair value hierarchy  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are  used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and  consists of the following three levels:  • Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that  are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or  indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
• Level 3 - Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable  inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation  model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are  they based on available market data.
The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy  approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value  measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.
The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair  value on a recurring basis and financial assets that are not measured at fair  value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required): (` crore) As at March 31, 2022  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Financial assets Mutual fund units  884  -     -     884  Equity shares  -     -     -     -     Government bonds and securities  25,667  -     -     25,667  Corporate bonds  1,242  -     -     1,242  (` crore) As at March 31, 2022  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Certificate of deposits  99  -     -     99  Commercial papers  381  -     -     381  T reasury bills  990  990  Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  assets  -     388  -     388   29,263  388  -    29,651  Financial liabilities Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  liabilities   -     128  -     128   -    128  -    128  (` crore) As at March 31, 2021  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  T otal Financial assets Mutual fund units 4,068  -     -    4,068  Equity shares  -     -     -     -     Government bonds and securities 23,670  -     -    23,670  Corporate bonds 450  -     -    450  Commercial papers 136  -     -    136  Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  assets  -    495  -    495  28,324 495  -   28,819  Financial liabilities Fair value of foreign exchange derivative  liabilities   -    92  -    92   -    92  -    92  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  355 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity  The Company’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies.
Given  the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in  Indian Rupee.
This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.
The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC)  to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Company  which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency  fluctuations.
Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the  Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is  generally a bank.
The following are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been  designated as cash flow hedges: Foreign currency As at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021 No.

Exchange gain of `645 crore and `490 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency  options and futures contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting have been  recognised in the standalone statement of profit and loss for the years ended   March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Net loss on derivative instruments of `26 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve  as at March 31, 2022, is expected to be transferred to the statement of profit and  loss by March 31, 2023.
The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow  variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2022.
Following table summarises approximate gain / (loss) on the Company’s other  comprehensive income on account of appreciation / depreciation of the underlying  foreign currencies: (` crore) As at  March 31, 2022 As at  March 31, 2021 10% Appreciation of the underlying foreign  currencies (387) (306) 10% Depreciation of the underlying foreign  currencies 2,034 1,906 (m) Financial risk management  The Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely  impact the fair value of its financial instruments.
The Company has a risk  management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and  liabilities.
The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability  of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the  financial performance of the Company.
Market risk  Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial  instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Such changes  in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign  currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market  changes.
The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of  foreign currency exchange rate risk.
• Foreign currency exchange rate risk   The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential  impact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive  income and equity, where any transaction references more than one  currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other  than the functional currency of the Company.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the  Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative  instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange.
Further, any movement  in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company  against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in  international business.
The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It hedges a part of  these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk  management policies.
The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the  net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  357 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional  currency of the Company.
The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures  of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the  statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.
Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the  derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).
The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign  currency exposure as at March 31, 2022: (` crore) USD EUR GBP Others Net financial assets  515  89  147  1,709  Net financial liabilities  (8,981)  (513)  (1,403)  (1,049)   10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the  Company with respect to various foreign currencies would result in  increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately  `949 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022.
The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign  currency exposure as at March 31, 2021:  (` crore) USD EUR GBP Others Net financial assets  3,981  (9)  264  1,390  Net financial liabilities  (3,053)  (564)  (608)  (774)   10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the  Company with respect to various foreign currencies would result in  increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately  `63 crore for the year ended March 31, 2021.
• Interest rate risk   The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing  investments.
Hence, the Company is not significantly exposed to interest  rate risk.
Credit risk  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay  or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk  encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration  of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled  by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous  basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals  for credit.
Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk  principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial  instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial  assets.
Inter-corporate deposits of `5,386 crore are with a financial institution  having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies.
Bank deposits  include an amount of `4,800 crore held with three Indian banks having high  credit rating which is individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s  total bank deposits as at March 31, 2022.
None of the other financial  instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.
• Exposure to credit risk   The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents  the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk  was `90,388 crore and `77,949 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021,  respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with  banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference  investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial  assets.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  358 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements   The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single  customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivable  and contract assets as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
• Geographic concentration of credit risk   Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of  allowances) and contract assets is as follows: As at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America  52.43  53.78  48.67  49.97  India  12.73  10.68  15.32  13.27  United Kingdom  16.47  16.84  17.05  17.42    Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of  allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the  customers.
The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables for  the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was `96 crore and `176  crore, respectively.
The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful trade  receivables is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended   March 31, 2022 Y ear ended   March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year  1,082  938  Change during the year  96  176  Bad debts written off (39) (30) T ranslation Exchange difference (2) (2) Balance at the end of the year 1,137 1,082    Liquidity risk   Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial  obligations.

Company as a lessee  The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a  lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates  the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of  the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate  standalone price of the non-lease components.
The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the  underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date.
The  cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the  amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease  payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives  received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be  incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or  restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located.
The right-of-use  asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation,  accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of  the lease liability.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the   straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease  term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The estimated useful lives of   right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,  plant and equipment.
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever  there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease  payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease.
The lease  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  362 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that  rate can be readily determined.
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the  Company uses incremental borrowing rate.
For leases with reasonably similar  characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing  rate for the portfolio as a whole.
The lease payments shall include fixed  payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price  of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise  that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease  term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.
The lease  liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to  reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect  the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed  lease payments.
The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement  of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset  and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification.
Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability,  the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in  statement of profit and loss.
The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases  to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less  and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
The lease payments  associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line  basis over the lease term.
Company as a lessor  At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as  either an operating lease or a finance lease.
The Company recognises lease  payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis  over the lease term.
In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised  over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate  of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
When the Company is  an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the  sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with  reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with  reference to the underlying asset.
If a head lease is a short-term lease to  which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies  the sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company  applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the  consideration in the contract.

8) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities  (a) Property, plant and equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price  and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working  condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than  freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.
Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line  basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful  lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  364 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any  change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below: T ype of asset Useful lives Buildings 20 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Plant and equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Vehicles 4 years Office equipment 2-5 years Electrical installations 4-10 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years  Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction  and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be  recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher  of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an  individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are  largely independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable  amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset  belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than  its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to  its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of  profit and loss.

(b) Intangible assets  Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition,  as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if  any.
Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software  licences which are amortised over licence period which equates the economic  useful life ranging between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period  of its economic useful life.
Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there  is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

10) Revenue recognition  The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting  and business solutions.
The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive  powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and  solutions.
Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the  Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
• Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on  output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of  transactions processed, etc.
• Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services  contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is  recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined  over the period of performance.
• In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting  with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of  the performance obligation.
The contract costs used in computing the  revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
• Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and  manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront  at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the  customer.
In cases where implementation and / or customisation services  rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and  revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
• Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at  the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
• The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party  equipment or software.
In such cases, revenue for supply of such third  party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  371 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer.
The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration  when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it  is acting as an agent.
Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the  consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits,  performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in  the contract with the customer.
Revenue also excludes taxes collected from  customers.
The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer  multiple products and services to a customer.
The Company assesses the  products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance  obligations in the contract.
Identification of distinct performance obligation  involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the  customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.
Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the  contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance  obligation.
The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer  consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume  discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives.
The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time  value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.
Any  consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price,  unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer.
The  estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price  only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the  amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed  at the end of each reporting period.
The Company allocates the elements  of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract  unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.
The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance  obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time.
The Company  considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services  are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence  of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use  of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the  customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at  arm’s length.
Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain  software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation.
Such costs are  amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is  less.
The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in  particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used  to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to  be recovered.
Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned  over billings on contracts.
Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables  (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive  cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there  are billings in excess of revenues.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  372 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance  based payments and / or milestone based progress payments.
Invoices are  payable within contractually agreed credit period.
In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract  provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a  contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract  specification and requirements.
The Company reviews modification to contract  in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price  could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an  existing obligation could undergo a change.
In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature  of services, industry verticals and geography.
Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Consultancy services 1,59,106 1,34,585 Sale of equipment and software licences  1,235  1,378  1,60,341 1,35,963  Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Banking, Financial Services and Insurance  58,614  51,189  Manufacturing  14,576  11,747  Retail and Consumer Business  26,966  22,219  Communication, Media and T echnology  28,778  24,243  Life Sciences and Healthcare  18,341  14,920  Others  13,066  11,645  1,60,341 1,35,963  Revenue disaggregation by geography is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Americas  North Ame rica  90,630  76,510   Latin America  314  288  Europe  United Kingdom  27,595  22,913   Continental Europe  17,595  15,364  Asia Pacific  11,178  9,839  India  9,547  8,102  Middle East and Africa  3,482  2,947  1,60,341 1,35,963  Geographical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  373 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  Information about major customers  No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue  during the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.
While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be  recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially) satisfied performance  obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise  those revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in   Ind AS 115.
Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate  transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance  obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds  to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material,  outcome based and event based contracts.
Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to  variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of  contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in  currency rates, tax laws etc).
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated  to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `93,546 crore  out of which 56.71% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year  and the balance thereafter.
No consideration from contracts with customers is  excluded from the amount mentioned above.
Changes in contract assets are as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year  3,051  3,486  Invoices raised that were included in the  contract assets balance at the beginning of the  year  (2,464)  (2,795) Increase due to revenue recognised during the  year, excluding amounts billed during the year  2,828  2,332  T ranslation exchange difference  55  28  Balance at the end of the year  3,470  3,051   Changes in unearned and deferred revenue are as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year  3,161  2,915  Revenue recognised that was included in the  contract liability balance at the beginning of the  year  (2,311)  (2,388) Increase due to invoicing during the year,  excluding amounts recognised as revenue  during the year  2,735  2,602  T ranslation exchange difference  (12)  32  Balance at the end of the year  3,573  3,161  Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  374 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  Reconciliation of revenue recognised with the contracted price is as follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Contracted price 1,62,898 1,38,292 Reductions towards variable consideration  components  (2,557)  (2,329) Revenue recognised 1,60,341 1,35,963  The reduction towards variable consideration comprises of volume discounts, service  level credits, etc.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and  losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan  assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with  a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in  which they occur.
Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised  as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment  occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or  termination benefits.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  375 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents  the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value  of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the  present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the  scheme.
The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund  (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined  benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans  Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when  employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.
The Company provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined  contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution  plans.
Short-term employee benefits  All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering  the service are classified as short-term employee benefits.
Benefits such  as salaries, wages etc.
and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised  in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to  measure the Company’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31,  2022.
The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan  obligations funds for year ending March 31, 2023 in view of adequate surplus  plan assets as at March 31, 2022.
The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined  benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase.
The  sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible  changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting  period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit  obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Increase of 0.50%  (159)  (190) Decrease of 0.50%  170  206   If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined  benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Increase of 0.50%  171  206  Decrease of 0.50%  (161)  (192) Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  381 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the  actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the  change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the  assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of  the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit  Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that  applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the  balance sheet.
Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the  consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk  and return profiles.
Investment and contribution policies are integrated within  this study.
The defined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31,  2022 as follows: (` crore) Y ear ending March 31, Defined benefit obligations 2023  455  2024  377  2025  396  2026  386  2027  392  2028-2032  1,909   Provident fund  In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India  are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both  the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to  a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute  the amounts entitled to employees.
This plan is a defined benefit plan as the  Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at  the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered  provident fund.
A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to  Government administered pension fund.
The contributions made by the  Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in  statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.
In accordance  with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of  guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions  as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present  value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected  amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected  guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

The principal assumptions used in determining the present value obligations of  interest guarantee under the deterministic approach are as follows: As at   March 31, 2022 As at   March 31, 2021 Discount rate 7.00% 6.50% Average remaining tenure of investment  portfolio 8 years 8 years Guaranteed rate of return 8.10% 8.50%  The Company expensed `1,372 crore and `1,078 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards provident fund.
Superannuation  All eligible employees on Indian payroll are entitled to benefits under  Superannuation, a defined contribution plan.
The Company makes monthly  contributions until retirement or resignation of the employee.
The Company  recognises such contributions as an expense when incurred.
The Company has  no further obligation beyond its monthly contribution.
The Company expensed `271 crore and `254 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards Employees’ Superannuation  Fund.
Foreign defined contribution plan  The Company expensed `885 crore and `658 crore for the years ended  March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, towards foreign defined contribution  plans.
13)  Cost recognition  Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and have been classified  according to their nature.
The costs of the Company are broadly categorised in employee benefit  expenses, cost of equipment and software licences, depreciation and  amortisation expense and other expenses.
Other expenses mainly include  fees to external consultants, facility expenses, travel expenses, communication  expenses, bad debts and advances written off, allowance for doubtful trade  receivables and advances (net) and other expenses.
Other expenses are  aggregation of costs which are individually not material such as commission  and brokerage, recruitment and training, entertainment, etc.

Current and deferred taxes  are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to  items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income taxes  The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the  Company having its branches in India and overseas where it operates.
The  current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable  on worldwide income after taking credit for tax relief available for export  operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is  computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in  which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available  for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide  income.
Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the  balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision  arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit  intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
Deferred income taxes  Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred  income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable  temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and  their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the  initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business  combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the  time of the transaction.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable  that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary  differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each  reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred  income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax  rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary  differences are expected to be received or settled.
For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have  been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences  between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.
Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 Standalone Financial Statements  |  385 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes  levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle  its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance  with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against  future current income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred  tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it  is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be  realised.
The income tax expense consists of the following: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Current tax Current tax expense for current year  12,912  10,404  Current tax benefit pertaining to prior years  (981)  (104)  11,931  10,300  Deferred tax Deferred tax benefit for current year  (395)  (294) Deferred tax benefit pertaining to prior years  -     (64)  (395)  (358)  11,536  9,942   The reconciliation of estimated income tax expense at statutory income tax  rate to income tax expense reported in statement of profit and loss is as  follows: (` crore) Y ear ended  March 31, 2022 Y ear ended  March 31, 2021 Profit before taxes  49,723  40,902  Indian statutory income tax rate 34.94% 34.94% Expected income tax expense  17,375  14,293  Tax effect of adjustments to reconcile  expected income tax expense to reported  income tax expense Tax holidays  (4,604)  (4,708) Income exempt from tax  (1,240)  (773) Undistributed earnings in branches  (232)  26  Tax on income at different rates  1,107  1,103  Tax pertaining to prior years  (981)  (168) Others (net)  111  169  Total income tax expense  11,536  9,942   The Company benefits from the tax holiday available for units set up under  the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.

In April 2016, the  Company received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of  `7,115 crore (US $940 million) to Epic which was thereafter reduced  by the T rial Court to `3,179 crore (US $420 million).
Pursuant to  reaffirmation of the District Court order in March 2019, the Company  filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order.
Epic also  filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge  of `757 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,514 crore   (US $200 million) in punitive damages.
On August 20, 2020, the Appeals  Court vacated the award of `2,119 crore (US $280 million) in punitive  damages considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and  remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess  and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,060 crore   (US $140 million), affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the  jury’s award of `757 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages  for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company,  and affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of  `1,060 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of  the comparative analysis by the Company.
The proceedings for assessing  punitive damages have been remanded back to the District Court.
Both  the Company and Epic have filed their briefs at the District Court in  relation to punitive damages.
The matter is under consideration by the  District Court.
On April 8, 2021, Epic approached the Supreme Court  seeking review of the order of the Appeals Court vacating the award of  `2,119 crore (US $280 million) towards punitive damages and remanding  back to District Court with an instruction to reassess the punitive  damages, to no more than `1,060 crore (US $140 million).
On March  21, 2022, Supreme Court denied Epic’s petition seeking review of the  order.
The Company will continue to pursue all legal options available in  the matter.
