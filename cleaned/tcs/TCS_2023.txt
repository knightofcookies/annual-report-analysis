At the same time,  the world is navigating several important  transitions: the Energy transition, the Supply  Chain transition and the AI transition.
Undoubtedly, these transitions will require  significant investments in technology and  innovation, and offer a huge growth  opportunity for the IT industry.
Letter from the Chairman  |  6 Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to share that your company has done well in a  volatile global environment in the year gone by.
In FY 2023,  your company delivered revenue of ₹225,458 crore, a growth of  17.6%.
This growth has come at an industry-leading operating  margin of 24.1%.
TCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable  their business transformation, helping them accelerate new  technology adoption and bring agility into execution.
We work  with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a  digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of  data and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and  employee experiences.
Your company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by  new customer additions and deep client relationships.
In FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance  across markets and industry verticals.
The order book continues  to be strong, indicating demand for your company’s services.
From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over  614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates.
The global environment is going through considerable changes.
Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and  Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have  caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the  overall economic environment.
At the same time, the world is navigating several transitions.
Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant  investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge  growth opportunity for the IT industry.
The global energy transition is accelerating.
Businesses are  making clear commitments towards a sustainable future.
There are many  innovations across products, services,  manufacturing, and delivery.
New business models are also  emerging.
This requires investments in technology and  innovation including electric mobility, renewable power,  hydrogen and sustainable fuel.
In addition, sustainability  compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new  standards and regulations are coming into play.
Across the facets  of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be  an important enabler for businesses.
The supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political  situation is altering the global supply chains.
Companies are  rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency.
New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India  playing an important role.
This is being led by significant capital  investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing  and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem  integration with partners.
In the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital  technologies, bringing about a transformation across every  industry.
Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition  a central focus.
The impact of AI and Machine learning is going  to be profound.
There is a transition already underway from  predictive AI to generative AI.
Majority of the businesses are  still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing  large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT .
There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors.
Leveraging generative AI would further require technology  innovation and investments.
There is another important area that companies need to focus  on – building talent for the future.
The energy, supply chain and  AI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill  existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest  in research.
Our technology strengths make us well-placed to  respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base.
As the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also  assessing their approach to talent.
Today, companies can tap  into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness  the global talent pool effectively.
Technology and tools are  facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models  of work.
Harnessing this talent will need an approach that  leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective  employee engagement and collaboration.
Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities  which include products and platforms that are AI-powered.
Over the last few years, your company has leveraged  partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous  software-defined 4G/5G network stack.
5G technologies along  with IoT , edge and AI will enable new digital transformation  opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer .
We will also invest in research areas important for the future,  in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up  ecosystem.
I would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution  during his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for  the future.
I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the  very best in his new role as CEO & MD of your company.
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services,  I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and  support.
Warm regards, N Chandrasekaran Chairman Letter from the Chairman  |  7 Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive,  in good times and bad.
During the up-cycle, we help clients  accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to  diﬀerentiate themselves and drive growth.
On the down cycle,  we help them adapt, using technology to drive the eﬃciency,  agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy,  and prepare for better times ahead.
Letter to Shareholders1 Dear Stakeholder, Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience  even as other parts of the technology universe deflated,  and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major  markets throughout FY 2023.
Our revenue for the year  was ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6% over the prior year        (13.7% in constant currency).
This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of  24.1%.
Our Net Margin was at 18.7%.
The Earnings Per Share  was at ₹115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.
From an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY 2023  was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew  22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2% and  Communications, Media and Technology which grew 18.1%.
Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.6% while  Manufacturing grew 14.1%.
Others, which make up 8.2% of  revenues, grew 22.5%.
By geographic markets, North America grew 24.2%, UK grew  11.4% and Continental Europe grew 9.2%.
Among emerging  markets, Latin America grew 24.8%, India grew 14.9%, Middle  East & Africa grew 12.5% while Asia Pacific grew 7.1%.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹24 per  share, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹115 per  share.
For the full year, the company’s shareholder payout was    ₹42,079  crore, 108.2% of the free cash flow during the year.
Innovate, Adapt, Thrive Our performance this year reflects how much of an enterprise  staple IT services have become.
Our full services capability  enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad.
During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand  their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and  drive growth.
On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using  technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed  to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times  ahead.
Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for  enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution.
They  engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of  their bigger, more complex workloads.
The breadth and depth  of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge,  strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our  portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct  competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.
We also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing  cloud expenses.
In some cases, it required rearchitecting  their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of  dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods  of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times.
Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed  services to rein in cloud costs.
The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive  innovation within enterprises.
The availability of compute, data  1 GRI 2-22 Letter to Shareholders  |  8 Investing in People and networks at scale provides access to powerful technologies  like advanced analytics and machine learning, applied to diverse  areas like computer vision, text and speech processing, in  domains like dynamic supply chain optimization, new molecule  discovery in life sciences and usage-based pricing of insurance  coverage.
Newer developments like generative AI, large language models,  and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and  innovation by our clients.
Our investments in research and  innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation  architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in  these initiatives.
Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where  we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams  to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained  further traction in FY 2023.
7 new clients signed up during the  year, bringing the total to 30 clients.
Some of the emerging innovation themes that we helped  customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models  underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and  blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector;  AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and  new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail  industries.
Within our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business  model innovation continued to be a key theme.
For example,  for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service  delivery platform central to their new business model of  providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement  services of various home appliances to households.
Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in  the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into  e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from  a traditional distributor to a platform company that does  distribution.
Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house  of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate  Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their  omnichannel modernization and transform the customer  journey experience.
Other G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability continued to  bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements  for us in FY 2023.
Elsewhere in this report, you can read about  the work we did for Philips Domestic Appliances in its journey  to be a standalone company, and how we helped Eversource  Energy pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations.
Digital transformation, which began in the front office, towards  enhancing customer experience, made further inroads within  the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous value  in the middle and back office.
As critical technologies such as  machine vision and conversational systems get better with  the use of AI, our Machine First™ approach is helping clients  use them innovatively in the back office, embedding them  into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity, agility,  throughput and resilience – which, among other things, also  enhances customer experience.
The supplyside challenges of the last two years peaked in  the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn reaching  unprecedented levels.
We broke out of the vicious cycle of hiring  and counter-hiring within the industry by investing in onboarding  an unprecedent number of fresh engineers – over 110,000 in  FY 2022 and over 44,000 in FY 2023 – and training them on the  technologies most in demand.
Newer developments like generative  AI, large language models, and  quantum computing triggered more  experimentation and innovation  by our clients.
Our investments in  research and innovation across  different industries, and our Pace  innovation architecture have  positioned us well to partner with  them in these initiatives.
Applied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT  operations, this can result in an entirely new operating  model that significantly boosts our clients’ competitiveness.
As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half  of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their  spends and showing greater interest in such operating model  transformations.
TCS Cognix™, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite,  has been a game changer, enabling faster transformations  that deliver concrete business benefits within months.
Its 600  pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug  and play transformation of a range of business and technology  functions, horizontal and vertical.
Nearly 300 of our clients have  used it to transform their business and IT operations.
In traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services  integrated deals.
By consolidating multiple elements of the  operation stack – processes, applications, and the underlying  technology and infrastructure – with a single strategic partner,  clients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce  complexity and derisk their larger business transformations.
The  same rationale is driving more vendor consolidation initiatives  that favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end service  offerings, the right innovation capabilities and scale.
All these trends play to our strengths.
Our scale, structure, and  ability to bring together different capabilities into a seamless  service delivery team, helped us win several large deals  throughout the year .
Letter to Shareholders  |  9 So long, farewell This year marks a key milestone in my journey with TCS, and  an important transition point for the company, as I step down  from my role as CEO and MD on 31st May 2023.
It has been an  absolute privilege and an unparalleled learning experience to  lead our company in the last six years, a period of tremendous  growth and transformation for us.

Your feedback and insights helped  me learn and shaped my worldview.

With enterprises relying on technology ever more to drive their  competitive differentiation, technology intensity is rising and  on a secular basis, the share of IT services within overall tech  spending is also going up.
I am confident that TCS’ best years are  ahead, and I look forward to watching the company’s continued  success from outside.
Best Regards, Rajesh Gopinathan Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (For FY 2022-23) Caring for Communities We continued to work with communities across the world,  pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in the  areas of skills development, bridging of digital divides and  STEM education.

On the environmental front, we continue to make good progress  in our net zero journey.
We have brought down our absolute  carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 71%  over base year 2016, meeting our target two years ahead of  time.
This was despite increased electricity consumption in FY  2023 from employees’ return to office.
In addition to enterprise- wide initiatives for energy efficiency, we have also significantly  increased our use of renewable energy.
Renewable energy  sources today make up 55% of the total (7.25% in 2016).
In FY 2023, we focused on utilizing the spare capacity built up in  the prior year, and recalibrated our hiring especially as attrition  started falling in the second half of the year .
Our LTM attrition in  IT services for the year was 20.1%.
Net addition in FY 2023 was  22,600, and the closing headcount was 614,795.
Our workforce  continued to be very diverse, with over  150 nationalities  represented and with women making up 35.7% of the employee  base.
Our investments in organic talent development continue to  deliver exceptional outcomes.
In FY 2023, TCSers logged  48.3 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 6 million  competencies.
Popular technologies witnessed unprecedented  levels of interest from our employees.
During the year, 53,000  TCSers acquired certification on hyperscaler cloud skills, bringing  the total number to over 110,000, making TCS one of the Top 2  partners to the largest cloud providers.
Letter to Shareholders  |  10 Letter from the CEO I am truly humbled by this opportunity to lead this remarkable  organization that I have been part of for 34 years.
The culture,  values and ethos of TCS and the Tata group have been an  inspiration always.
Your company has a very strong leadership  team and a workforce that is highly motivated.
It is my privilege  to lead this talented team.
As part of the transition, I interacted with a number of our  customers, leadership teams and employees.
This has further  enriched my understanding of the depth of our customer  relationships, customers ‘priorities and the opportunities  ahead of us.
I see a huge potential to create positive impact for  our clients, our employees and for the broader community of  stakeholders that we serve.
Dear Shareholder, As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see  sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer  experience and business model transformation.
Through  these initiatives, our customers intend to avoid technology  obsolescence, become an intelligent enterprise, introduce new  products and services, orchestrate ecosystems and provide  immersive, hyper-personalized experiences.
In addition, all our  customers have also committed to ambitious net-zero carbon  emission targets.
On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT,  generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others  are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in  the short to medium term.
As technology adoption will remain a key driver of business  growth and transformation for our clients, we have been  relentlessly focussed on our clients’ needs and have been  investing in building newer capabilities to help them accelerate  technology adoption.
Your company continues to focus on  enhancing the talent base of its associates, building partnerships  with key technology providers, expanding the innovation  ecosystem and building its own products and platforms.
These business and technology trends drove a strong deal flow  throughout FY 2023, peaking in the fourth quarter .
We closed  the year with an order book of $34.1 Bn.
This along with the  strong pipeline replenishment gives us a good visibility for the  medium term.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your  continued support in this exciting journey ahead.

So when health-tech giant Royal  Philips sold Philips Domestic Appliances in 2021 to Hillhouse,  a private equity firm, the standalone company, rebranded as  Versuni, saw the separation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity  to wipe the slate clean and transform into a digitally lean, agile,  and innovation-led organization.
Versuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from  strategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and  agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and  quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first  application landscape.
The program entailed decoupling the  company from the parent’s systems, while simultaneously  transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious  2-year timeframe.
The business transformation, enabled by SAP as the digital core,  establishes best practices-based processes from the consumer  products industry and simplified ways of working to drive speed,  agility and insights-led decision-making.
TCS enabled Versuni’s strategies for driving revenue growth  opportunities and innovative product launches.
The new  processes support Versuni’s journey to develop products made  with more sustainable materials, that are easier to repair,  refurbish, recycle, and help to reduce waste.
Enhancements were made to deliver superior business  outcomes across every function.
Integrating supply chain  planning with factory scheduling will enable higher warehouse  productivity and more timely shipments.
AI-powered insights  in finance will help improve cash flow, free up cash and drive  efficiencies in back-office functions.
The new people processes  will provide a better employee experience and enable a more  responsive HR function.
Partnering with TCS helped Versuni deploy a new digital  foundation and operate as an independent entity.
The new fit- for-purpose stack enables Versuni to more effectively respond  to the fast-changing demands of the consumer products market,  and pursue its vision of turning houses into homes, and building  lifetime engagement with consumers.
I am really happy to have partnered with TCS in this  journey.

Leaders in the sector are using technology  innovatively to draw environmentally conscious consumers  looking for greener choices, and grow their new clean energy  businesses.
Eversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that  operates New England’s largest energy delivery system, with  4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts  (MA) and New Hampshire.
It is focused on making its  operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more  clean and affordable energy to New England.
Eversource partnered with TCS to build a solution that  would help them on-board distributed solar power  capacity within its grid by purchasing power  from residential, industrial and commercial  customers who install solar panels and  storage on their properties, and enabling  them to avail of incentives offered by their  respective states, as part of state-level Net  Zero programs.
The TCS-built solution includes onboarding  of new solar customers, a customer  application that helps keep track of the units  generated, and a pricing engine that uses a  declining block pricing mechanism to  incentivize early enrolment as a producer .
It  also includes a billing system that processes  recovery charges, solar credits and incentive  payments, and enables flexible payment  options as well as hardship relief options to  improve affordability and increase adoption of  energy efficiency programs.
To facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS  architected a reusable framework that would  simplify adoption of each state’s incentive program  into Eversource’s core platform, enabling the utility to  pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for  each state.
Using this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage  state incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly  benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while  driving growth of its clean energy business.
At the same time,  it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power,  accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but  also that of the states it services.
Making green energy affordable is central to our business  strategy.
Its technology enablement was a fairly complex  program with multiple sub-programs running concurrently.
TCS did an outstanding job in collaborating well with multiple  stakeholders and managing risks very well.
The TCS team’s  contextual knowledge of the Eversource business and  technology landscape resulted in a high quality solution that  helped meet the regulatory mandate as well as Eversource’s  clean energy and energy affordability goals.

This framework brings  together the best of TCS’ talent, research and innovation inputs,  global capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and  speed up ‘Ideas to Outcomes’.
For an insurance major, we worked with the client’s teams  and collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of  brainstorming workshops using the Clay Map.
Leveraging our  AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got  turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise.
In just  eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24  progressed to become MVPs.
One reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their  contextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the  client’s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply  rooted in that organization’s reality and therefore more likely to  succeed.
How does TCS help clients innovate, adapt and thrive?
Generative AI is the talk of the season.
What is the business  opportunity around it?
Innovation is about having a lightbulb moment.
How do you  scale that?
KAK: Software that writes software has been around for a  long time.
In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS’ very first  offshore development project, delivered using an in-house  code generator.
In the 80s, our TRDDC  was famous for its  tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators  on demand, converting source code from any programming  language to any other language.
TCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients  for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based  applications.
In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS  BaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft.
Even  though there is effort involved in defining the model up-front,  clients see significant productivity benefits.
The new low code, no code platforms have done away even  with those overheads.
Their graphical drag and drop user  interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build  sophisticated applications very quickly.
And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression.
It has  only led to more growth.
We believe generative AI will be no  different.
Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply  bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer  productivity immensely.
This will result in greater consumption,  with volume growth more than making up for the effort  deflation.
If generative AI takes over coding, won’t the IT services  industry become redundant?
require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text,  images and higher-level abstraction.
Legal and procurement teams can use it to trawl through  contracts to identify specific clauses, or prepare a summary of  variations of a particular clause.
HR could use it for handling  employee queries.
Sales and customer service want smart  assistants that can explain product features and answer  questions.
In IT , generative AI can create basic code snippets or  quality check developed code for adherence to standards.
These are just the initial ideas based on the standalone  capabilities of generative AI.
Over time, you will see newer use  cases that are more combinatorial, driving greater spending by  enterprises and expanding the opportunity significantly.
Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat  |  28 KAK: We have been leaders for a while, but perceptions can  be too rooted in historic stereotypes to recognize the change.
Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a  subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking  platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India.
A similar  model is powering start-up banks in Israel today.
The insurance  HV: The evidence is empirical.
Every new generation of  technology has led to reduction in programming effort per  function point.
But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate  spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over  decades.
Take for example, the switch from assembly language to C.  Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable  pre-defined procedures.
A developer could invoke a procedure  with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code  base, without actually coding all of it from scratch.
Three lines  of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language.
The  10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers.
Instead, there was an explosion in software development  because the same IT team could now build ten times as many  function points.
Similarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a  big cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated.
Instead,  those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose  to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded.
Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms.
Why is that so?
Farm mechanization caused effort  deflation and rendered the agricultural workforce  redundant in the West.
Indian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new  technologies.
Will that change with generative AI?
What is the evidence for this thesis?
KAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any  increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or  service the market can consume in a defined period.
When farm  mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand  for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the  effort deflation because there was only so much land available  to till.
Demand for IT services behaves differently.
In every enterprise,  there is significant unmet demand.
Every CIO has limited  capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement  backlog that never gets fulfilled.
Technologies like generative  AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and  accomplish much more with the same budget.
But even then,  the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on  business users’ ingenuity or competitive drive.
Demand just rises  to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.
HV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas,  experimentation and more demand for our services.
To that  extent, business application of generative AI, along with other  technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills  up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity.
platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in,  went on to make us the market leader in life and pensions  administration in the UK.
Historically, gaining leadership in IT services on any new  technology required just training sufficient numbers of  people in that technology, ahead of market demand.
In the  last decade, we not only did that at scale on the entire class  of digital technologies, but also invested in higher order  capabilities so we could advise our clients on how best to  harness the combinatorial power of new technologies in their  specific business context.
We scaled up our Research and Innovation, exploring use cases  across different industries, creating solutions and showcasing  them at our innovation centers.
We expanded COIN, created  new innovation frameworks and set up Pace Ports, our               co-innovation hubs, across the world.
Today, we not only  have a large number of patents, but also the largest portfolio  of products and platforms in our peer set, helping win large  transformational engagements that uniquely distinguish us.
We are helping clients explore and develop end-to-end  scenarios in combining technologies like quantum computing,  generative AI, 5G and the emerging 6G, and new concepts in  cyber security.
Here in India, we have stitched together a fully  indigenous network stack for 4G and 5G, a unique achievement  that differentiates us from our global peers.
Elsewhere, we are pursuing 5G-enabled opportunities in  operational technologies such as autonomous machines and  remote operations.
We are looking at emerging cross-industry  ecosystem business models in sustainability and energy  transition, which will be the big drivers of growth in the coming  years.
HV: On the cloud, the biggest technology trend in recent years,  we were one of the earliest to set up dedicated business units  for each of the three leading hyperscaler clouds.
Our early  investments in building deep expertise and a large portfolio  of innovative cloud-native solutions helped us capture  tremendous growth and gain share.
We are today one of the largest partners – in some cases,  the largest partner – to each of those providers, in terms of  number of employees with certifications, volumes of workloads  migrated to the cloud and in number of solutions and  intellectual property on their platforms.
We are the launch partner for their latest offerings, whether it  is AWS’ Mainframe Modernization, Finspace, and IoT Fleetwise  offerings, or Azure’s Sustainability, Supply Chain Platform,  and Financial Services and Retail Industry Cloud, and now  for Google Cloud’s Generative AI solutions.
If all this isn’t  leadership, what is?
Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat  |  29 Revolutionizing Small Value Payments in South Africa BankservAfrica, Africa’s leading automated clearing house,  has been facilitating payments in South Africa and the region,  for over five decades through its seamless interbank clearing  and settlement services.
It has a track record of pioneering  innovations like the SASWITCH, a national network of  interoperable ATMs, in the mid-80s.
When the South African Reserve Bank unveiled its Vision  2025 strategy to reform the South African national payment  system framework, BankservAfrica took the lead along with its  ecosystem partners, and engaged TCS to build a new platform  for rapid payments that would usher in the era of modern,  cost-effective, instant digital payments on the continent.
TCS designed a high availability, containerized, cloud optimized  solution with TCS BaNCS for Market Infrastructure at its core,  using high performance microservices for clearing and payment.
Hosted on a public cloud, the solution is very resilient and can  auto-scale.
On the front-end, users can make a payment, or a request  for payment, through a payment service called PayShap,  formally launched in March 2023.
Very conveniently, users  don’t need to enter the recipient’s bank account or branch  code details to make payments.
Instead, they can use a  unique identifier such as the recipient’s mobile number, or  a  b a n k - g e n e r a t e d  i d e n ti fi c a ti o n  n u m b e r,  w h i c h  s e r v e s  a s                                                                                                     a proxy for the full banking details.
This proxy and resolution  is enabled through a tamper-proof blockchain-based solution  powered by TCS’ Quartz Smart Solution.
By democratizing access to a frictionless system for low value  payments, TCS’ innovative solution for BankservAfrica has the  potential to reduce the use of cash for small transactions and  accelerate formalization of the unorganized sector.
It will drive  new fee-based revenues for banks, and also offer customer  insights with which they can offer credit to more consumers.
This will not only improve financial inclusion, but also add to  South Africa’s GDP growth – a fitting outcome for two very  purpose-driven organizations that came together to build this  platform of national importance.
BankservAfrica views cost-effective digital payments as a  pathway to improving credit access and financial inclusion in  South Africa.
After an extensive evaluation, we selected TCS for  their deep understanding of the payments ecosystem, global  experience, technological expertise, intellectual property  and shared values.
The outcome has been very gratifying.
By  changing consumer behaviors, PayShap has the potential to  reshape sectors and transform the South African economy.
Roshan Moonsamy                                                                                   Interim CEO and CFO  BankservAfrica Customer Stories  |  30 Supporting T akenaka  Corporation Realize  its Vision of a  Sustainable Society  Founded by a master builder (toryo) more than  400 years ago, Takenaka Corporation has  specialized in building construction with an  integrated design-build approach that includes  initial planning and aftercare services like  maintenance.
It has redefined urban landscapes  in Japan and around the world, with famous  landmarks like Tokyo Tower and Changi International  Airport.
At the core of its longstanding business success  is its passion for innovation rooted in its toryo spirit,  quality management, and its commitment to realizing a  sustainable society.
Takenaka’s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial  revolution in the building industry by embracing digital  transformation across the construction value chain.
It is  addressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such  as labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase  employee productivity and improve the work-life balance of  employees.
Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design  and construction planning, next-generation work sites with  construction robots and remotely operated cranes, and  environmentally conscious smart buildings with  intelligent controls using IoT .
The foundation for this  innovation is the Building 4.0 TM digital platform, which  is being developed and operated in partnership with TCS.
Building 4.0TM will integrate data from sales, design, estimation,  engineering, construction management, facilities management  services, human resources and accounting.
This will enable  superior decision-making across a wide range of operations  through advanced analysis using machine learning and AI.
In building design, for example, structural engineers can use  AI-based cross-section estimations to more efficiently implement  optimal structural designs.
In construction, it can enable better  construction planning using accurate forecasts of materials and  personnel required to achieve target schedules, improve visibility  of project progress, and enhance labor productivity.
TCS is supporting Takenaka in promoting innovation, building  construction digital twins, simulating human behavior, utilizing  knowledge of the construction field, and exploring “what-if”  scenarios.
The knowledge gained from these efforts will help  Takenaka develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions  through better designs, understand project risks, and improve  KPIs for quality, cost, schedule, safety, and the environment.
Through Building 4.0TM, Takenaka will continue to create  new value for society and customers while improving  business efficiency.
It will also contribute to the realization  of a sustainable society enabling new architecture and urban  creation services that is in harmony with the environment and  local communities.
We selected TCS for supporting our digital transformation not only  because of its accumulated global knowledge and technological  capabilities, but also because throughout the long histories of both  companies, there is a common bond in our corporate cultures of  valuing stakeholders, including society and customers as well as  employees.
Building 4.0 will turn the dreams of our stakeholders  into reality, and we would like to develop it as a foundation to  connect with a sustainable society of the future.
Keizo Iwashita                                                                                     General Manager of Digital Division & Executive Officer Takenaka Corporation Customer Stories  |  31 ML: One swallow does not a summer make.
This unprecedented  event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too,  and might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just  like anybody else.
As for our track record in retaining senior  leadership talent, it remains industry-leading.
I am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business  heads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS.
We have over  125,000 TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years  in TCS.
This cohort represents the true strength of TCS.
They  are the custodians of our culture, values and institutional  memory, and have been central to our ability to weather the  unprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting  it affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients  have come to expect from TCS.
We not only retained our leadership talent better, but also  expanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by  incubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with  P&L responsibilities.
The breadth and depth of our leadership  bench today makes our succession planning an industry  benchmark, with multiple equally-qualified successors for any  leadership position, starting from the CEO down, as you recently  witnessed.
SS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it  a tailwind.
We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from  backfilling and retention expenses.
If we onboarded a lateral hire  at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee  cost is a recurring one.
But yes, hopefuly we won’t have any new  headwind due to attrition in FY 2024.
Also, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental  cost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an  opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense.
That is one  important margin lever for FY 2024.
Utilization improvement,  flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are  the other levers.
On the other hand, we will have our usual wage  increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel  expenses during the year .
SS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily  margin dilutive.
A few high profile mega-deals in the industry  whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in  that perception.
In the last five years, TCS has won several mega  deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens  of large deals, with TCV over $50 million.
And yet, during this  period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between  24 and 26 percent.
Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct  them.
A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost  reduction at the time of contract renewal.
The service provider  can either drop prices and sacrifice margins to deliver those  You stood out in the industry with virtually zero attrition at  senior levels.
Now you had CEO-level attrition for the first time  in your history.
What does this say about your retention of  senior talent?
Is normalizing attrition a margin tailwind for FY 2024?
What is  your margin outlook for the year?
You won many large outsourcing deals in FY 2023, and your  highest ever number of large deals in Q4.
Won’t this hurt  margins in FY 2024?
Q&A with CFO Samir Seksaria Milind Lakkad CHRO Q&A   |  32 ML: Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem.
The pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons.
SS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind  because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living  adjustments written in.
But in the medium and longer term, this  will get adjusted.
Wage inflation affects everybody in the market including the  clients themselves.
Newer contracts reflect the changed cost  structure for onsite effort.
Also, contractual terms now peg  annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates.
That  should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts.
SS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency  depreciation.
Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit,  interest rate differentials and capital movements.
But for  argument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit  of currency depreciation in the future.
Now remember, the  currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation  in India which historically, we never passed on to clients.
In  the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new  contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been.
So in the  longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins.
ML: In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into  clients’ expectations around project velocity and throughput.
For a given project team size, clients will expect much higher  output at a much faster pace, compared to today.
On aggregate,  as the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to  increase.
With ever-increasing dependence on technology for  competitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to  keep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent.
So the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going  away any time soon.
SS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness.
Based  just on the productivity improvements in code generation  using generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which  is freely available to everyone – service providers as well as  clients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by  extension, margins.
Margin improvement is possible from selling  higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use  generative AI.
Likewise, new software products or platforms  which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes.
With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you  manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile  doing similar work?
Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your  margins?
Without the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater  strength than in the past.
How will your margins sustain then?
Finally, a question on generative AI.
Will the productivity gains  delink revenue growth from headcount addition in the future?
Can we expect a higher margin as a consequence?
ML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for  everybody, but there were drawbacks.
Tenured employees who  are well networked within the organization can work effectively  and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up  over the years.
That isn’t the case with more junior employees.
Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team- building suffered a lot in these two years.
Then there is the matter of organizational culture.
Over half our  workforce today was hired after March 2020.
New employees  get acculturated through physical interactions with senior  colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their  behaviors and ways of thinking.
Without those interactions,  employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly  impacted.
All these factors led us to gradually bring back people  to our offices during the year .
Why is Return to Office so important to TCS?
Why not let  employees continue to work from home?
ML: Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or  lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual.
There might be  other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home  during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for  some women, keeping them from returning to office even after  everything normalized.
The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our  efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down  on it.
Focused leadership development programs like iExcel  are driving tremendous change.
Of all the leadership positions  fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up  23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for  only 14% of the applicant pool.
This speaks well of the quality  of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as  the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting  diversity.
Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1%  of our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce.
Attrition among women is higher than for men.
Why?
How are  you addressing this?
savings, or propose a completely different operating model  that uses lesser effort, protects or even expands margins, and  achieves the client’s objectives.
TCS has differentiated itself in this space with the latter  approach.
Its win-win propositions reimagine the customer’s  operating model, leveraging AI and machine learning to reduce  human intervention while improving process velocity and  operational resilience.
Customers have really taken to this idea.
In FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation  deals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18  in the prior year .
One, we are running a program called Elevate that empowers  employees to take control of their careers and pursue their  aspirations by achieving certain learning goals.
Meeting  those goals can result in significant pay increases, perhaps  even a doubling of salary.
Second, there will be a natural  time-correction through performance-linked wage increases,  promotions and voluntary attrition.
Q&A   |  33 Innovating to Improve Crop Yields and Farmer Incomes With climate change, agriculture is increasingly vulnerable  to extreme weather events, inconsistent rainfall, as well as  increased pest and disease outbreaks.
This affects crop yields,  farmer incomes and food security.
To help address these challenges, TCS built a digital platform  to empower the Indian farmer and improve the resilience of  the nation’s farming sector.
The TCS Digital Platform for Next  Generation Agriculture (DNA) is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based  decision intelligence and crop monitoring system that provides  customized, site-specific predictive advisory services to farmers  and other players in the food value chain.
TCS DNA uses an innovative `Sky-Earth’ convergence, intelligently  fusing remote-sensing data from earth observation satellites and  drones with data from proximal sensors and handheld devices  on the field.
This gives scale and reduces cost significantly  without sacrificing accuracy.
Proprietary AI/ML algorithms are  utilized to analyze the data and provide reliable information and  predictive intelligence on weather, soil condition, crop health,  and pest forecasts.
Farmers can use these insights to make  quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs  and improve their yield.
Rallis India Ltd, a leading agri-input company, partnered with TCS  for the first field deployment of the new platform, to improve  the productivity of its hybrid seed production farms, as well as  for internal business planning.
Branded Drishti (“Vision”), the  platform is used to monitor approximately 130 million hectares  of agricultural land across India, for various aspects such as  crop productivity, soil moisture, early alerts for pest outbreak,  as well as seasonal weather anomalies and extreme weather  events.
The platform has helped Rallis increase the field scouting  efficiency of its hybrid seed production team, and improved  yield by 1 to 2%.
TCS DNA is also helping Amalgamation Plantations, the second  largest producer of tea in India, improve the quality and  sustainability of tea leaves procured from small tea growers.
It is being used to remotely monitor various aspects of small  plantations using satellite imagery, predict pest and disease  and improve quality.
This is expected to help small tea growers  improve their income by 15% and reduce rejections by 20%.
Our partnership with TCS is helping us alleviate  the issues of farmers and agriculture.
The Drishti  platform identifies problem areas and offers  actionable insights to farmers in India, leading to  effective crop management by reducing the risks  and minimizing the loss in yield.

: 1129/2021 Place: Mumbai Da te: 12.04.2023 Management Discussion and Analysis   |  86 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Management  Discussion and  Analysis Overview of the Industry Global GDP in FY 2023 was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war  and resultant dislocations in supply chains, leading to surging  food and energy inflation.
Central banks raised interest rates  sharply in response.
As a result, the global GDP is estimated to  have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the  prior year 1.
Global technology spending on Enterprise software and IT  services crossed the $2 trillion 2 mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY .
IT services grew 3.5% YoY , to $1,250 billion.
This growth was led  by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise  due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital  transformation to cover more back-office operational areas.
The global IT services industry continues to be a highly  fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid- single digit market share.
TCS is among the largest IT services  providers globally, with a market share of 2.2%, and has  outperformed the market, growing significantly higher than  market growth over the last decade.
Global Spend on IT Services ($ Bn) TCS Revenue $ Bn FY 2013 FY 2023 2.4x 1.4x USD Billion 1600 800 400 200 100 50 10 0 11.6 878 1,250 27.9 The outperformance may be attributed to market share gains  resulting from TCS’ longer-term, purpose-driven partnerships  with its customers, its agile organization structure, and a very  stable management team; its investments in organic talent  development, research and innovation, intellectual property and  in building newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet  share with clients; and better execution resulting in greater  customer satisfaction.

21.1 (20.6) Business Outlook Global growth is projected to moderate from 3.4 percent in  2022 to 2.8 percent in 20238 , weighed down by central banks  raising interest rates to fight inflation, and Russia’s war in  Ukraine.
In major economies, the heightened risk of a recession  – made worse by a banking crisis – has led to uncertainty in  enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on capex and  certain discretionary programs.
Despite this, spending on IT services has been resilient so far .
Cloud migration programs are continuing apace, and clients  continue to launch new G&T projects.
The higher level of  uncertainty in the business environment has made clients  more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and business  operating model transformations that can not only deliver  significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile  and resilient.
All this has resulted in a strong order book for  FY   2023, at $34.1 Bn, which is 1.2 times revenue.
The pipeline  has also grown well.
This provides visibility on medium-term growth amid near- term uncertainty.
If the delayed decision-making and cash  conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023  flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some  moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong  growth.
Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in  FY 2024 include: •  T echnology transformation: IT infrastructure  modernization, cloud enablement, application and data  estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and  collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins,  cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/ Edge and AI adoption.
8  IMF World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023 Management Discussion and Analysis   |  95 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 • G&T : Customer experience transformation using  personalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive  experiences using XR/Metaverse, product and business  model innovation, supply chain modernization, M&A  integration / divestitures, sustainability.
•  Oper ations: Traditional outsourcing, vendor consolidation  and multi-services deals, AI/ML-led transformation of IT  / business operations for greater resilience and leaner  operating models, managed services models and real time  operation visibility.
Enterprise Risk Management9 FY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges continuing  to shape the overall risk profile of the company.
Macroeconomic  and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the year .
The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions, trade wars  and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct and  cascading impacts on economies and businesses.
Shortages,  rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy crisis led to  further uncertainties in the economic growth environment,  with the year ending with banking industry upheavals in US and  Europe.
During the year, IT organizations including TCS faced the  knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact  of hybrid modes of working.
Technological advancements and  breakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up  new vistas of both risks and opportunities.
TCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business  environment very closely and has strengthened the deployment  of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address  the risks and leverage the associated opportunities.
This  framework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk  response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk  governance.
Key risk indicators and control indicators are used  to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their mitigation  actions respectively.
TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering  strategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic  risks, thus enabling informed decision-making.
Risks are  assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and  bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units,  geographies, business functions, customer relationships and  individual projects.
Listed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact on the company and mitigation strategies.

Positive Management Discussion and Analysis   |  105 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Internal Financial Control Systems and their Adequacy TCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control  with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, on the lines  of the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway  Commission.
The Internal Control – Integrated Framework  (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency  and accountability in an organization’s process of designing  and implementing a system of internal control.
The framework  requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage  appropriate responses.
The company has successfully laid down  the framework and ensured its effectiveness.
TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the  nature of its operations.
These have been designed to provide  reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing  reliable financial and operational information, complying with  applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use,  executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring  compliance with corporate policies.
TCS has a well-defined  delegation of power with authority limits for approving contracts  as well as expenditure.
Processes for formulating and reviewing  annual and long-term business plans have been laid down.
TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP)  system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data  for accounting, consolidation and management information  purposes.
It has continued its efforts to align all its processes  and controls with global best practices.
TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s  internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation  17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)  Regulations, 2015  (SEBI LODR) as of March 31, 2023.
B S R & Co. LLP , the statutory auditors of TCS have audited the  financial statements included in this annual report and have  issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control  over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies  Act, 2013).
TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP (PwC) LLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its activities.
The  audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each  year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved  by the Audit Committee.
In line with international practice,  the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of  internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such  as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement,  employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including  the subsidiaries and foreign branches.
TCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party  consultants and professionals for business specific compliances  such as quality management, service management, information  security, etc.
The Audit Committee reviews reports submitted  by the management and audit reports submitted by internal  auditors and statutory auditors.
Suggestions for improvement  are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective  action.
The audit committee also meets TCS’ statutory auditors  to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal  control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its  major observations periodically.
Based on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies  Act 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR), TCS’ Audit Committee  has concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the company’s  internal financial controls were adequate and operating  effectively.

Being a  part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability,  the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and  transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the Tata  Code of Conduct (TCoC).
The Compan y has adopted a Code of Conduct for its  employees including the Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director and the Executive Directors.
In addition,  the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct for its non- executive directors which includes Code of Conduct for  Independent Directors that suitably incorporates the duties  of independent directors as laid down in the Companies  Act, 2013 (“the Act”).

The de tails of TCS’ board structure and the various  committees that constitute the governance structure1 of  the organization are covered in detail in this report.
The v arious material aspects of corporate governance and TCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below: Material Topic TCS’ Approach Board effectiveness,  independence and protection  of minority shareholders’  interests Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to  serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively  serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability  and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability.

Corporate Governance Report About TCS | 3 1 GRI 2-9 2 GRI 2-10 Corporate Governance Report   |  114 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Material Topic TCS’ Approach TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at   https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD.
Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent  directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent.
None of the independent directors is related to each other,  or to the non-independent directors.
Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.
Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds  directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as  an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.
TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC  which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders.
Further a qualified, diverse  and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.
TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures  and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and  material developments.
The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured  global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the  management or the Board.
Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office  through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure.
The Stakeholders’  Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.
Avoidance of conflict of  interest3 Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief  Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).
TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses  covering avoidance of conflict of interest.
Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any   employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility,  with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval.
For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.
Values, Ethics and compliance6 Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and  has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global  business.
The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual,  Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.
The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate  citizenship.
It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights,  prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and  avoidance of conflicts of interest.
Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining.
Web-based  annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code.
Further,  frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values  and the TCoC.
Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through  inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.
Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical  behaviour .
They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company,  which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department.
Employees and other  stakeholders can also report any non  - compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by  senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower  Policy without fear of retaliation.
Information about these channels is communicated to  employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

are monitored through formal compliance  procedures led by the Corporate compliance office.
Changes to legislation are closely  monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.
Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer,   Chief Risk Officer and the Chief HR Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and  Executive Director (COO and ED), and CEO and MD respectively.
At the apex level, the Audit  Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery  and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations.
Tax Strategy7 TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the  respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner .
TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose  of gaining tax advantages.
TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where  available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the  tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates.
Compliance is achieved through a  robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing  the tax risk.
TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by  itself or by its employees or vendors.
TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities  worldwide.
Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the  proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.
Board Oversight of  Sustainability Matters8 TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by  creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers  and local communities, while also valuing the environment.
The various sustainability topics  material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below: Material Sustainability Topics Board Committee Financial reporting, robustness of internal controls and risk  management systems, auditor remuneration, compliance to  policies around insider trading, whistle blower, ethics and TCoC.

Stakeholders’ Relationship  Committee Community initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility,  including compliances.
Corporate Social  Responsibility Committee Succession planning TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and an  organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three business  groups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and Business  Transformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that  enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy.
Succession  planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior  management.
Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key  functions within their units.
Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board.
Business or unit  heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an  opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

Literacy as a Service Adult non-literacy continues to be a problem holding back India  from reaching its full economic potential.
Women account for  65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized  communities.
To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised  the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the  Government of India’s eﬀorts to improve literacy.
LaaS provides  an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT  with the theory of cognition and laws of perception.
LaaS adopts  creative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as  animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.
Modules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10  hours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen  entitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages – nine Indian,  and three foreign.
Thus far, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance  for over 1.13 million learners (~60% women) and more than  200,000 Preraks through literacy.
In August 2022, TCS launched the ‘Each one Empowers one’  portal which allows employees of TCS and Tata Group, along  with their families, to empower non-literates in their local  community, such as security guards, domestic workers and  gardeners.
The program has generated transforming impact by promoting  social inclusion, ﬁnancial stability and economic growth.
It has also  propelled neo-literates to receive better access to government  beneﬁt programs, ﬁnancial systems and empowered them to have  a more signiﬁcant say in family and community decision-making.
LaaS Case Study Pyari Ben resides in the Bijori hamlet  of Puwasa village, in Madhya Pradesh’s  Alirajpur district, one of the least literate  and poorest districts in the country.
Due  to limited local employment prospects,  villagers from Alirajpur travel for work  to nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an  exception in this regard.
She never had the opportunity to  attend school, so she never achieved literacy.
This became  diﬃcult because she couldn’t keep track of her hard-earned  daily income as a construction worker .
She gained basic literacy skills after joining the Literacy as  a Service (LaaS) program, which made her realize that her  contractor used to defraud her by not paying her the proper  wages.
LaaS gave her the awareness she needed to ﬁght for  her rights and ultimately get her dues.
She can now calculate  her working hours and daily pay, create a budget, and save  money.
She created a bank account and enrolled in Ayushman Bharat,  a health insurance scheme, to obtain medical beneﬁts for  herself and her family.
As a migrant who travels from her  village to distant work locations, she can now read and  recognize train numbers to board the correct train.
Pyari  inspired other women in the village and encouraged them to  participate in this program.
Ignite My Future (IMF) Ignite My Future is a teacher professional development program  which introduces the concept of computational thinking into all  core subjects.
This is a transdisciplinary education program that  transforms the way students learn.
IMF has generated a great impact through professional  development oﬀerings, special projects as well as volunteer  and customer engagements with the partnered schools.
IMF’s  Learning Leaders community supports the growing global  community of partnered educators, committed to learnings  about the power of computational thinking.
This year, IMF  India launched Learning Leaders’ regional chapters, catering to  regional learning requirements of the teachers from the partner  districts across India.
Corporate Social Responsibility  |  138 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 goIT prepares students with engaging design workshops and  custom mentorship to pursue the careers of tomorrow of  which involve STEM and computer sciences.
It uses a four- pronged model of (1) volunteer-driven engagements, in- person or virtually, (2) seamless year-round connects via goIT  Online, (3) SDG-focused monthly challenges and (4) Work  experience designed to introduce students to local experts  and opportunities.
Each prong is layered with school district  partnerships and mentoring by industry professionals from  TCS which helps students develop core skills and makes goIT a  unique program.
After over a decade of success and a footprint across 42  countries, goIT has beneﬁted over 144,000 students who have  designed more than 29,000 tech-for-good digital innovation  prototypes.
Over 41,000 students and educators have beneﬁted from this  program in FY 2023 globally.
goIT Case Study Speaking about her experience at the ﬁrst inaugural TCS goIT  program in Saudi Arabia, Leah, a Grade 7 student, said, “I am  super happy to have had the opportunity to get involved in the  design thinking program.
The mobile app training is cool, and  I am proud of my project on improving world health by using  technology.” The event was celebrated with more than 100 learners from  the Al Sahafa International School, Riyadh.
Under the theme  of UN SDG, students ideated solutions for good health and  wellbeing, aﬀordable and clean energy, and zero hunger .
Grade 7 students prototyped a mobile solution called ‘Team  Earth’ which displays the location of the nearest renewable  energy outlets and ﬁnds an environmental, social, and  governance volunteer.
Meanwhile, Grade 5 students pitched a  technology solution to solve world hunger by creating an app  called ‘Free Supermarket’ which would help people make and  receive donations.
Excited to see the STEM exposure students received through  the TCS goIT program, the Academic Coordinator of Al Sahafa  International School, Ola Mourad said, “Programs like this  are extremely important in showing students how they can  succeed in a range of ﬁelds, with a good grounding in IT.” BridgeIT BridgeIT is a unique initiative created to bridge the digital  divide that places socially and economically underprivileged  communities at a disadvantage.
The program creates digital  entrepreneurs who use IT to help local citizens avail essential  digital services in education, adult literacy, unemployment  and social discrimination.
It attempts to address prevailing  social inequities in India by proactively reaching out to women,  Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) communities.
Launched in 2014, BridgeIT has a footprint across 30 districts in  10 states.
The program oﬀers budding entrepreneurs the skills,  mentoring, technology, tools and resources required to set up a  Digital Service Centre from where they can provide services such  One of the IMF’s pioneering STEM initiative interventions, Global  Innovations Project (GIP) aims to connect students and teachers  from around the world as they explore and solve real-world  problems using computational thinking.
This year, IMF India has launched its Season 1 of GIP , where  students were asked to explore accessible and adaptive tools,  identify and problem-solve community level issues that are  limiting the accessibility and inclusivity of all the learners.
Teachers and students from schools like School of Scholars  (Maharashtra), BGS Schools (Karnataka), Podar International  School (Maharashtra), Rajya Ashram Paddhati Vidyalaya (Samaj  Kalyan Department, Uttar Pradesh), APSWREIS (Andhra Pradesh)  in India have collaborated with schools from North America in  this experiential journey.
Overall, the participants from India worked on 109 innovation  projects, clocking over 560 collaborative learning hours and 268  videos over Microsoft Flip tool.
Teachers were very appreciative  of the opportunity to learn and collaborate with educators  around the world.
In FY 2023, IMF beneﬁ ted more than 293,000 students and  educators across North America, India, UK and Ireland, APAC and  ANZ.
IMF Case Study This year, Ignite My Future made its impact through  professional development, volunteer and customer  engagement and special projects.
One such collaboration was  with the Meghe Group of Schools to encourage students for an  interest in STEM and computational thinking.
“The purpose of education is best served when students  are doing something that would not only improve their  competencies but also create positive social impact.
Global  innovation project is one such opportunity I believe, because  students are not only reﬂecting upon what they have learnt but  are also getting step closer towards sustainable development  goals.
I am glad and proud of all the eﬀorts that students and  teachers have put in, also that they have consciously chosen  to be a part of this project in identifying how can they improve  accessibility not only around them but also pick up global  perspectives around it.
I am sure that the seeds of eﬀorts that  we are putting in most our students today, will give us citizens  of tomorrow who would have SDGs as inherent part of their  lives.
Thankyou TCS!” - Director, Meghe Group of Schools goIT TCS’ ﬂagship program goIT (go Innovate Together) is a Digital  Innovation program which prepares students with culturally  relevant and context-appropriate learning experiences, coupled  with modern technologies.
Across the world, the gap between employers’ needs and  available skills is growing.
The National Science Foundation  predicts that 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next  decade will require a form of mathematics and science skilling.
Insuﬃcient numbers of students pursuing these streams, and  lack of focus on innovation, problem-solving and creativity in  school curricula, are the big challenges in ful ﬁ lling those future  jobs.

In FY 2023, the program had 347 active digital entrepreneurs  providing several of these services in 1,735 villages.
146 of these  entrepreneurs were women.
BridgeIT Case Study Priyanka Kumari, a native of Dihi village, Latehar District,  Jharkhand, had never dreamt that one day she would be an  entrepreneur and earn an income of more than `40,000/-per  month.
Priyanka always had a desire to have her own identity.
When she got married, she was still doing her graduation.
She continued her studies after marriage and completed her  graduation in 2016.
In 2020, when she heard of BridgeIT she  grabbed the opportunity to be part of the program.
Gradually, she became a successful digital entrepreneur and is  now providing several services such as photocopying, printing,  taking and printing passport size photos, paying land taxes,  booking railway tickets, Aadhaar, PAN Card and Ration card  services, etc.
Today, Priyanka not only runs a shop near her  residence, she also has taken up the responsibility of another  shop at the Panchayat Bhawan of her village, employing two  other people from the village.
BridgeIT has inspired her to dream big and is successfully  supporting Priyanka in achieving her plans for future.
She says,  “My dream is to expand my business further and I want to keep  the latest models of mobile phones and other accessories for  sale in my shop.
Moreover, I also want to open a tent house  employing more needy people in the business.
Besides, I am  planning to buy a new scooty.” Youth Employment Program (YEP) YEP tackles one of the biggest challenges in India –  unemployment among youth, especially those from  marginalized sections of society, due to lack of 21st century  skills.
YEP provides employability training, imparting skills such  as business communication, aptitude, computer programming  and domain skills with the help of subject matter experts,  domain leaders, and certiﬁed trainers from TCS.
The program oﬀers participants a smooth transition from college  to careers, building their conﬁdence and enhancing their social  and economic status through its unique teach, coach, mentor,  and place model.
It helps them navigate opportunities available  in the Indian job market with career guidance and mentoring,  training on interview skills and access to market-facing  certiﬁcations and hands-on real-time project experience.
Since its inception, the program has: •  Impr oved the economic and social status of the  beneﬁciaries and their families.
•  Enc ouraged diversity and gender parity within the  workforce while creating inclusion and access for  marginalized groups across the country.
•  Incr eased the credibility and visibility of the training partner  institutions involved with YEP .
•  Enabled access f or corporates to season-agnostic, industry- ready talent.
•  Cr eated speciﬁc career paths for students in hospitality,  banking, retail and IT (which include cyber security,  networking, IT automation, Data Analytics, UX, SFDC to  name a few, etc.).
In FY 2023, more than 31,000 students were trained across  India, of which 57% were women and 17% from the groups  qualifying for aﬃrmative action programs.
Over 10,000 students  have gained employment in the IT/ITES, banking, retail ﬁelds.
YEP Case Study Preeti Diwakar was born and brought up  at Panipat in Haryana, and later her family  shifted to Kaushambi in Uttar Pradesh.
Her  father worked as a helper at local grocery  shops while her mother supported with  household chores in neighborhood.
Their  meagre income barely put food on the table  for the family of  ﬁ ve.
Preeti had to  ﬁ ght hard in her pursuit  of education.
She funded her own education by taking up  tuitions and borrowing course books from senior students  in school.
While pursuing BCom at University of Allahabad,  she discovered a strong desire to learn about the intricacies  of stock market, and later taught her classmates.
But she  had neither the funds to invest nor the conﬁdence to speak  about it.
She also lacked clarity on career goals or available job  prospects.
TCS Youth Employability Program brought a ray of sunshine  to her gloomy worldview.
During the Covid years, Preeti not  only learned math and reasoning skills, she also worked on her  overall personality.
She learnt from her trainer, the importance  of public speaking, projecting conﬁdence in online interviews,  and active listening.
In the TCS NQT exam later that year, she  scored 77.39% and got placed in December ’21.
She launched a website and her ﬁrst YouTube channel  “Commerce Stocking” about stock market investment tips.
In  December’22, she quit her job and became an entrepreneur,  launching her dream website for educating people on the  ﬁnancial sector.
In her own words, it was TCS’ YEP which  enabled her to ﬁnd her own voice and she has been following  it all along since then.

My life suddenly seemed to have  a meaning and purpose.
Giving is the greatest feeling in the  world, and seeing my students achieve their goals and ﬂourish  in their jobs brings me enormous joy.
Continue to contribute  to this worthy cause; these youngsters desperately need  mentoring from TCS YEP Faculties.” TCS Volunteers Deploy with Red Cross, NA In Oct’22, ﬁve TCSers deployed to Florida with the Red Cross  to volunteer in areas impacted by Hurricane Ian, the deadliest  hurricane to have hit Florida in decades.
Their reasons were  di ﬀer ent and reﬂ ected their life experiences.
Some signed on  to a 9-day deployment to give back to the community the help  they had received during a natural disaster .
Others had served  previously with the military or a service organization and  wanted to use that experience to help.
During their deployment, Aria Rahimi, Lewis Hunt, Charu  Mehndiratta, Patty Sanchez, and Niki Shah packed food  supplies and distributed them to aﬀected communities on  Pine Island and other areas in Lee County.
They assisted in  identifying and addressing local needs with respect to shelter,  food, health and spiritual services.
Business with Purpose Business with Purpose is a distinctive framework that enables  ‘Purpose Partnerships’ with like-minded organizations to  advance access, equity and inclusion around the world.
The  function serves as an accelerator for social good and as a  catalyst between purpose-driven organizations.
Several studies  and surveys have revealed that consumers are loyal towards  organizations that are “purpose driven” and have an objective of  “giving back to the community.”  Business with Purpose provides opportunities for business  leaders from customers’ organizations to meet their  commitment to the society.
This is enabled with strategic and  established programs like goIT, Ignite My Future in School, Youth  Employment which addresses pressing issues in countries where  TCS and its customers live and work.
Over 185 customer leaders which include 45 senior executives  participated in various CSR initiatives globally in FY 2023.
Community Innovation Program This initiative provides advisory and technology consulting  services on pro bono basis, to build capacity and capability for  organizations and non-proﬁts that seek to create social and  environmental impact.
In this digital age, it is imperative for non-proﬁt organizations  to use technology to become sustainable and build trust with  a multitude of stakeholders.
TCS’ leadership and employees  provide pro bono technology services to such organizations  to generate sustainable impact.
TCS works closely with key  stakeholders to understand their requirements and build the  right software tools that help them establish a digital presence,  raise funds more easily, build transparency in their operations  and work more eﬃ ciently.
This helps those organizations extend their support to more  local and global beneﬁciaries, demonstrating the force multiplier  eﬀect tha t technology can play.
Millions of dollars of ‘social  value’ have been generated by this program since its inception.
International Medical Corps (IMC) Case Study A ﬁrst responder, International Medical Corps (IMC) provides  emergency relief to those struck by conﬂict, disaster, and  disease.
IMC approached TCS seeking help in digitizing their vendor  pre-qualiﬁcation platform, a critical component of the  procurement workﬂow.
IMC does not procure supplies from  a vendor who has not completed the qualiﬁcation process or  whose qualiﬁcation has lapsed, which can lead to a shortage of  critical supplies that IMC beneﬁciaries depend on.
The process was arduous and complicated with a high  margin for potential error.
After in-depth research seeking  to gain a comprehensive understanding of IMC’s vendor  pre-qualiﬁcation system, TCS redesigned and enhanced the  existing system by placing it in a digital platform that is more  transparent and accessible for IMC’s team.
The system oﬀers  IMC a structured workﬂow for maintaining vendor information,  tracking critical vendor qualiﬁcation status, and ensuring the  organization has on-demand and concurrent access to vital  information throughout the vendor database.
Corporate Social Responsibility  |  143 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Last year, the organization responded directly to the needs of  more than 18 million people in 30 countries on ﬁve continents,  including more than 1 million people in the United States.
“Being a ﬁrst responder organization means our work is  fast-paced and vital to vulnerable populations.
Working  with TCS enabled us to increase the eﬃciency of our vendor  prequaliﬁcation process, which is critical to our operations,”  said Salma Abdelfattah, Pharmaceutical Services Coordinator,  International Medical Corps.
Digital Empowers TCS’s Digital Empowers is a thought leadership initiative that  raises awareness on how digital tools and innovative technology  catalyzes social impact.
The program focuses on convening  experts from technology, business, non-proﬁt, public policy,  and academia to ideate, collaborate, and create digitally driven  solutions towards challenges of social impact.
TCS has grown the  Digital Empowers community by more than 500 individuals and  the website provides up-to-date information for forums, events  and insight reports.
For FY 2023, TCS Digital Empowers, North America partnered  with Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP) and PYXERA  Global to host an eight-part virtual forum series on food security,  the future of work, mental health equity, the digital divide and  disaster response.
The ﬁnal forum took place in February 2023,  and the seven forums in 2022 culminated in an annual 2023  Summit.
The pilot of Digital Empowers Collaborative launched this year,  facilitated a 20-person collaboration from across sectors to  explore how digital can empower a more equitable and inclusive  future of work.
The group hosted four expert speakers and spent  more than 150 professional hours to develop three partnership  solution concepts to improve the future of work: 1)  Digit al Upskilling - A path to bring down the digital divide for  rural residents over the age of 50 for better participation in  the digital economy.
2)  Gener ational Workforce Knowledge Retention - A digital  wiki concept developed to support institutional knowledge  retention and cross-pollination of senior knowledge  to juniors enabling the retention of knowledge from a  growing retiring population amidst the high turnover rate  experienced by many organizations.
3)  E quitable Foundation for the Workforce of Tomorrow – An  employee resource group idea designed for a large-scale  group with high accountability and impact to create a safer  and more transparent workplace Purpose Partnerships TCS’ CSR education programs focus on developing 21st century  skills among the underrepresented and socio-economically  weaker sections of society.

This resulted in a ﬁnal contribution of  €1,260,000.
TCS participated in the ‘Sunﬂower Project’, an initiative from  the ‘Tent Partnership for Refugees’.
It provided mentoring,  training and upskilling to displaced Ukrainians to support their  economic integration in the host countries.
It also organized in- kind donations of more than 300 laptops to schools that support  refugees in Europe.
TCS launched several mentorship programs in Europe to help  refugees enter the labor market.
This involves capacity building  to strengthen the capabilities of NGOs through participation in  TCS’s Global Community Innovation program and exploration  of the upskilling needs of refugees with TCS Education Business  Units.
TCS worked with another non-proﬁt organization in  Finland that trains refugees from Ukraine as part of a program.
Turkey / Syria Earthquake The earthquake in Turkey and Syria caused massive destruction  and loss of lives.
TCSers were quick to respond and extended  their support to the humanitarian tragedy.
Employees  volunteered with local NGOs and launched donation drives  across TCS’ oﬃces in Europe to collect winter clothes, blankets,  food, and hygiene supplies for the aﬀected population.
The company partnered with non-proﬁt partners like  UNICEF , CARE and the European Food Banks Federation to  address critical needs such as access to safe drinking water  and sanitation services, beneﬁ ting over 20 million people.
Furthermore, short-term relief support such as shelter, food and  health and long-term resilience care (child protection, psycho- social protection and temporary learning spaces) were provided.
TCS also made a ﬁnancial contribution to UNICEF’s long-term  humanitarian relief eﬀorts in support and solidarity with the  people of Turkey and Syria.
Additionally, a matched giving  campaign was launched for the global workforce across various  platforms.
Donations made by TCS employees, their families  and networks were matched up to €200,000, for a combined  contribution of up to €550,000, through this.
Assam Floods During the Assam  ﬂ ood, TCS aided the relief activities through  its branch in Kolkata.
Flood responses were carried out in the  severely aﬀected areas of Cachar District, including the Kalain,  Katigorah, Borkhola and Salchapra blocks.
Over 1,200 household beneﬁciaries were identiﬁed after a  thorough door-to-door survey and approximately 850 shelter  kits and 800 housing kits were distributed to them.
The  volunteering eﬀorts included surveying each village to identify  beneﬁciary households, identifying and ﬁnalizing potential  distribution sites, and meeting stakeholders such as the District  Disaster Management Authority, and local security forces to  coordinate eﬀorts.
T CS also rendered additional support through  volunteer mapping, coupon generation and distribution at the  village level, as well as relief distribution.

St atement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG  related challenges, targets and  achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)32  N G Subr amaniam, COO & Executive Director, TCS33: “Our net zero goal underlines our renewed commitment to environmental  stewardship.
To curb emissions and limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre- industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models and aim for sustainable growth.
We are in a  unique position to combine our purpose-driven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but  also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions for a sustainable future,”   A t the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is increased use of renewable sources of energy, and improved  energy efficiency.
The company’s strategy for the latter includes addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate  portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever Energy™, which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI  to optimize energy consumption across campuses.
TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth from  campus expansion and brings down emissions related to employee commutes and business travel.

TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030.
The first part was achieved in FY 2023 through a combination of green infrastructure, green IT, energy efficiency and renewable  energy.
Commitmen t to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  In June 2022, T CS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero  through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign.
This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking  action - Science Based Targets.
TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.
Gr een Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:  All ne w campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency.
They have  roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint.
Currently, 36 TCS offices, with over 23.68 million sq.
ft  of office area, are certified green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC).
These make up over 64.6% of TCS’ total real  estate portfolio in India.
During the y ear, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT  infrastructure.
Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply  (UPS), LEDs, motors, and chillers.
•  HV AC system upgradation included deployment of energy efficient fans for Air handling units (AHUs), Variable Refrigerant  Flow (VRF) systems for 24X7 on variable load, oilless centrifugal chillers like magnetic or ceramic bearing chillers and chiller  plant manager .
•  Ener gy efficient UPS included Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based UPS with high efficiency and modular UPS.
•  Other ener gy efficiency initiatives included LED lighting with advanced controls, EFF1/IE3 rated high efficiency motors, 11KV  power distribution from sub-station to different buildings, use of 11 kV centrifugal chillers and elevators with energy efficient  and gearless motors.
81 Ther e are some inclusions and modifications in estimating carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022.
Sc ope 2 emissions: The emission factors for the grid electricity across various geographies have been taken primarily from IEA v5-IEA 2022  (12/2022) database except for US, Canada, Australia, and India where emission factors are available from regional sources.
For India geography,  the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), user guide 18.0, Dec 2022 emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh (carbon emission factor of grid  electricity, including RE) has been considered for estimating the carbon emissions from procured electricity in FY 2023.
Over the years CEA has  been publishing the weighted average carbon emission factor (conventional) of the grid which was being used by TCS for Scope 2 emissions  until FY 2022 as emission factors (including RE) was not available earlier .
However, in Dec 2022, CEA published the carbon emission factor of  grid electricity (including RE) for the first time for years 2013-14 to 2021-22.
As TCS procures electricity from the India grid, which is mix of  conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate.82 Corr ected Scope 1 emissions data for FY 2022 due to minor changes in fuel consumption data.

93  GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; Ther e are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY  2022.
94 Sc ope 3 emissions: •   Ca tegory 1 & 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG  Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment,  vehicles, and furniture items.
Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated.
In view of adopting  updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%.
•   Ca tegory 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned  vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in  FY 2023.
Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered.
The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total  emissions under category 3.
•   Ca tegory 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to  other supplies.
In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal.
The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen  supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous  wastes, batteries etc.,).
Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight.
The increase in  scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4.
•   Ca tegory 5: No change in approach in FY 2023.
The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of  waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.
•   Ca tegory 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail.
In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at  various geographies during business travel.
Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022.
The increase in scope of reporting contributes  to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6.
•   Ca tegory 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees  (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global).
In pre- pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021  and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category.
The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due  to majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.

Consolidated Financial Statements  |  183 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Independent Auditor’s Report To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata  Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the  Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and  its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which  comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023,  and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including  other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of  changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for  the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial  statements, including a summary of significant accounting  policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred  to as “the consolidated financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according  to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated  financial statements give the information required by the  Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give  a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs  of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated profit and  other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity  and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Our  responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the  Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent  Consolidated  Financial Statements  of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements  that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial  statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of  the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in  accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit  evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Key Audit Matter(s) Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period.
These  matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our  opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters.
Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts,  wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage  of completion computed as per the input method  based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs.
We identified revenue recognition of fixed price  contracts where the percentage of completion is  used as a key audit matter since - •  ther e is an inherent risk and presumed fraud  risk around the accuracy and existence of  revenues recognised considering the customised  and complex nature of these contracts and  significant inputs of IT systems; Our audit procedures included the following: •  Ob tained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls  implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue  and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue  balances.
•  In volvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as  required: 	  Assessed the IT en vironment in which the business systems  operate and tested system controls over computation of revenue  recognised; 	  T ested the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue  reports generated by the system;  Consolidated Financial Statements  |  184 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit •  applic ation of revenue recognition accounting  standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts  with customers) is complex and involves a  number of key judgments and estimates in  mainly identifying performance obligations,  related transaction price and estimating the  future cost-to- completion of these contracts,  which is used to determine the percentage  of completion of the relevant performance  obligation; •  these c ontracts may involve onerous obligations  which requires critical assessment of  foreseeable losses to be made by the Group;  and •  a t year-end, significant amount of work in  progress (Contract assets), related to these  contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.
  T ested the controls pertaining to allocation of resources and  budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorized recording/ changes to costs incurred; and 	  T ested on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the  estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective  projects.
•  On select ed specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that  the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition  accounting standard including – 	  E valuated the identification of performance obligations and the  ascribed transaction price; 	  F or testing the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract  costs and onerous obligations, if any.
We: 		•   assessed tha t the estimates of costs to complete were  reviewed and approved by appropriate designated  management personnel; 		•   perf ormed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred  with estimated costs to identify significant variations and  challenged whether those variations are required to be  considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the  contract; 		•   assessed the appr opriateness of work in progress (contract  assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying  documentation to identify possible changes in estimated  costs to complete the remaining performance obligations;  and 		•   inspect ed underlying documents and performed analytics to  determine reasonableness of contract costs.
Other Information The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the other information.
The other information  comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s  Annual R eport, but does not include the financial statements  and auditor’s reports thereon.
The Holding Company’s Annual  R eport is expected to be made available to us after the date of  this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the  Consolidated Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these  consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements  of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state  of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive  income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section 133 of the Act.
The respective Management and  Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are  responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records  in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding  the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting  frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application  of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant  to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated  financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,  which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the  consolidated financial statements by the Management and  Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the  respective Management and Board of Directors of the  companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing  Consolidated Financial Statements  |  185 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 the ability of each company to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the  respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the  Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in  the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting  process of each company.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our  opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but  is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with  SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit.
We also: •  Iden tify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures  responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•  Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances.
Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the company has adequate internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements in  place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•  E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by the Management and Board   of Directors.
•  Conclude on  the appropriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  appropriateness of this assumption.
If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw  attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a  going concern.
•  E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance of  the Holding Company and such other companies included in  the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the  planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit  findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where  applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to  outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial Controls The respective Company’s Management and the Board of  Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements based on the  criteria established by the respective company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note.
These responsibilities include the design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls  that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the  respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under  the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements based  on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the  Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed  under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an  audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements were established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial  Statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 with reference to financial statements and their operating  effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the preparation of consolidated financial statements for  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations  of management and directors of the Company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of  the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the  consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to  future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As at March  31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company  owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.
The Boar d of Directors approved the consolidated financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and  authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.
2)  St atement of compliance  These c onsolidated financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting  Standard (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under   section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as  amended from time to time.
3)  Basis of pr eparation  These c onsolidated financial statements have been  prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.
All  assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources  and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Group has  considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
The s tatement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows  from operating, investing and financing activities of the  Group are segregated.
The Group considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.
The functional curr ency of the Company and its Indian  subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`).
The functional currency  of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange  rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign  currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising  on settlement and restatement are recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in  foreign currencies are not retranslated.
The signific ant accounting policies used in preparation of  the consolidated financial statements have been discussed  in the respective notes.
4)  Basis of c onsolidation  The Compan y consolidates all entities which are controlled  by it.
The Compan y establishes control when; it has power over  the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns  from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to  affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant  activities of the entity.
En tities controlled by the Company are consolidated from  the date control commences until the date control ceases.
The r esults of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year  are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and  up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The financial s tatements of the Group companies are  consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company  transactions, balances, income and expenses are  eliminated in full on consolidation.
Chang es in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do  not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity  transactions.
The carrying amount of the Company’s  interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted  to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the  subsidiaries.
Any difference between the amount by which  the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value  of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly  in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.
Asse ts and liabilities of entities with functional currency  other than the functional currency of the Company have  been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the  balance sheet date.
Statement of profit and loss of such  entities has been translated using weighted average  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  197 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 exchange rates.
Translation adjustments have been  reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the  statement of changes in equity.
When a foreign operation  is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control,  significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative  amount of exchange differences related to that foreign  operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of  profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
5)  Use of es timates and judgements  The pr eparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management to make  estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the  periods presented.
Es timates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  and future periods are affected.
The Gr oup uses the following critical accounting estimates  in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:  (a)  R evenue recognition    R evenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method.
The Group uses  judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion  of the contracts which is used to determine degree of  completion of the performance obligation.
(b)  Use ful lives of property, plant and equipment    The Gr oup reviews the useful life of property,  plant and equipment at the end of each reporting  period.
This reassessment may result in change in  depreciation expense in future periods.
(c)  Impairmen t of goodwill    The Gr oup estimates the value-in-use of the cash  generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash  flows after considering current economic conditions  and trends, estimated future operating results and  growth rate and anticipated future economic and  regulatory conditions.
The estimated cash flows are  developed using internal forecasts.
The discount rates  used for the CGUs represent the weighted average  cost of capital based on the historical market returns  of comparable companies.
(d)  F air value measurement of financial instruments    When the f air value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets,  their fair value is measured using valuation techniques  including the Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs  to these models are taken from observable markets  where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing fair  values.
Judgements include considerations of inputs  such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.
Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the  reported fair value of financial instruments.
(e)  Pr ovision for income tax and deferred tax assets    The Gr oup uses estimates and judgements based  on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of  revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is  exercised while determining the provision for income  tax.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent  that it is probable that future taxable profit will be  available against which the deductible temporary  differences and tax losses can be utilised.
Accordingly,  the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the  carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of  each reporting period.
(f )  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities    The Gr oup estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable  that outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligations.
These provisions are reviewed at the end  of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect  the current best estimates.
The Gr oup uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities.
Contingent liabilities are  recognised when there is a possible obligation arising  from past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence  of one or more uncertain future events not wholly  within the control of the Group or a present obligation  that arises from past events where it is either not  probable that an outflow of resources will be required  to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the  amount cannot be made.
Contingent assets are  neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated  financial statements.
( g)  Emplo yee benefits    The acc ounting of employee benefit plans in the  nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use  assumptions.
These assumptions have been explained  under employee benefits note.
(h)  Leases    The Gr oup evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to  be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.
Identification of a lease requires significant judgement.
The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the  lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the  applicable discount rate.
The Gr oup determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both  periods covered by an option to extend the lease  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  198 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option; and periods covered by an option to terminate  the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to  exercise that option.
In assessing whether the Group  is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend  a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a  lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances  that create an economic incentive for the Group to  exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to  exercise the option to terminate the lease.
The Group  revises the lease term if there is a change in the non- cancellable period of a lease.
The disc ount rate is generally based on the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being  evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar  characteristics.
6)  R ecent pronouncements  Minis try of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to  time.
On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:  Ind AS 1 – Pr esentation of Financial Statements  The amendmen ts require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant  accounting policies.
Accounting policy information,  together with other information, is material when it can  reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements.
The Group  does not expect this amendment to have any significant  impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 12 – Inc ome Taxes  The amendmen ts clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and  decommissioning obligations.
The amendments narrowed  the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15  and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no  longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition,  give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary  differences.
The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its  financial statements.
Ind AS 8 – Acc ounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors  The amendmen ts will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates.
The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates.
Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in financial statements that are subject to  measurement uncertainty”.
Entities develop accounting  estimates if accounting policies require items in financial  statements to be measured in a way that involves  measurement uncertainty.
The Group does not expect this  amendment to have any significant impact in its financial  statements.
7)  Busi ness combinations  The Gr oup accounts for its business combinations under  acquisition method of accounting.
Acquisition related costs  are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit  and loss as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets,  liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition  for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the  acquisition date.
P urchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value  of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Where  the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed  the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values  of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is  recognised as capital reserve.
The in terest of non-controlling shareholders is initially  measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling  interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable  net assets.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an  acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition,  the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the  amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in  equity of subsidiaries.
Business c ombinations arising from transfers of interests in  entities that are under common control are accounted at  historical cost.
The difference between any consideration  given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in  shareholders’ equity.
8)   Fina ncial assets, financial liabilities and equity  instruments  Financial asse ts and liabilities are recognised when the  Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which  are initially measured at transaction price.
Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair  value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or  financial liability.
The Gr oup derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,  or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when,  and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  199 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Cash and c ash equivalents  The Gr oup considers all highly liquid investments, which  are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and  usage.
Financial asse ts at amortised cost  Financial asse ts are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
Financial asse ts at fair value through other  comprehensive income  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
The Gr oup has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments  not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Financial asse ts at fair value through profit or loss  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at  fair value through other comprehensive income on initial  recognition.
The transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in  statement of profit and loss.
Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities ar e measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.
E quity instruments  An equity ins trument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of  its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are  recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.
Deriv ative accounting  •  Ins truments in hedging relationship    The Gr oup designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as  hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The Gr oup uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company and its  subsidiaries which are approved by their respective  Board of Directors.
The policies provide written  principles on the use of such financial derivatives  consistent with the risk management strategy of the  Company and its subsidiaries.
The hedg e instruments are designated and  documented as hedges at the inception of the  contract.
The Group determines the existence of  an economic relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item based on the currency,  amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce  the risk associated with the exposure being hedged  is assessed and measured at inception and on an  ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no  longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have  been accumulated in other equity are immediately  reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.
The e ffective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under  the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Gr oup separates the intrinsic value and time value  of an option and designates as hedging instruments  only the change in intrinsic value of the option.
The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and  time value of an option is recognised in the other  comprehensive income and accounted as a separate  component of equity.
Such amounts are reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss when the related  hedged items affect profit and loss.
Hedg e accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no  longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or  loss recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity till that time remains and is  recognised in statement of profit and loss when the  forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and  loss.
Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the  statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes  ineffective.
•  Ins truments not in hedging relationship    The Gr oup enters into contracts that are effective  as hedges from an economic perspective, but they  do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The change in  the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
Impairmen t of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Gr oup assesses at each date of balance sheet whether  a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  200 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 through a loss allowance.
The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables  that do not constitute a financing transaction.
In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used  a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix.
The  provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information.
The expected  credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix.
For  all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at  an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since  initial recognition.

Carr ying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022,  approximate the fair value due to their nature.
Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other  financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value  due to their nature in each of the periods presented.
Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required.
Fair value of  investments carried at amortised cost is `5,587 crore and `1,672 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(j)  F air value hierarchy  The f air value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable  or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:  •  Le vel 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•  Le vel 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either  directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
•  Le vel 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market  transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
The c ost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide  range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.
The Boar d of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk  management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Under the  guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward,  currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks  associated with the financial assets and liabilities.
The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus of  the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse  effects on the financial performance of the Group.
Mark et risk  Mark et risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices.
Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign  currency exchange rate risk.
•  F oreign currency exchange rate risk    The fluctua tion in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and  loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where  assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities.
Considering  the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from  fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.
The Gr oup, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange.
Further, any  movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact  the Group’s revenue in international business.
The Gr oup evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It  hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
The f oreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of  Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
The f ollowing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy  Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive  income and equity.
Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by  the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).

•  In terest rate risk    The Gr oup’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments.
Hence, the Group is not significantly  exposed to interest rate risk.
Cr edit risk  Cr edit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms  or obligations.
Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well  as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous  basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.
Financial ins truments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments,  derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets.
Inter-corporate deposits of  `1,016 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies.
Bank deposits include  an amount of `4,273 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of  the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023.
None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material  concentration of credit risk.
•  Exposur e to credit risk    The c arrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum  exposure to credit risk was `1,09,258 crore and `1,05,498 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the  total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loan, contract assets and  other financial assets.
The Gr oup’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade  receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and 2022.
•  Geogr aphic concentration of credit risk    Geogr aphic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows: As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America  43.65  44.31  43.79  44.69  India  15.45  14.06  15.51  13.83  United Kingdom  16.05  16.37  16.47  16.86     Geogr aphical concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the  location of the customers.
The allo wance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, was   `126 crore and `123 crore respectively.
The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful trade receivables is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Balance at the beginning of the year  1,333  1,289  Change during the year  126  123  Bad debts written off  (253)  (83) Translation exchange difference  7  4  Balance at the end of the year  1,213  1,333  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  212 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   Liquidity risk    Liquidity risk r efers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations.
The objective of liquidity risk  management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.

Gr oup as a lessee  The Gr oup accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the  contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of  the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.
The Gr oup recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease  commencement date.
The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial  measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease  Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  215 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling  and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located.
The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted  for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
The Gr oup measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily  determined.
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.
For leases with reasonably  similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease  or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.
The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease  payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that  option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate  the lease.
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease  liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any  reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.
The Group recognises the amount  of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit  and loss depending upon the nature of modification.
Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re- measurement in statement of profit and loss.
The Gr oup has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease  term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
The lease payments associated with these  leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Gr oup as a lessor  A t the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
The Group  recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In case of a  finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on  the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease  and the sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from  the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.
If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the  exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arr angement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with  customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Gr oup has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.
The present value of  future cash outflows for such extension periods is `786 crore and `773 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Lease c ontracts entered by the Group majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course.
The Gr oup does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.

Depr eciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value  over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at  the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

P roperty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher of the fair value less cost to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU)  to which the asset belongs.
If the r ecoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

(b)  Goodwill    Goodwill r epresents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of  the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated  impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the  implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.
C GUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication  for impairment.
The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic  uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and  subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other  assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Goodwill c onsists of the following: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023 As at   March 31, 2022 Balance at the beginning of the year  1,787  1,798  Translation exchange difference 71 (11) Balance at the end of the year 1,858  1,787     Goodwill of  `685 crore and `646 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business  in France.
The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate  for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 9.30%.
An analysis of the sensitivity of the  computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on  reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease  below its carrying amount.
The r emaining amount of goodwill of `1,173 crore and `1,141 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, (relating  to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the  recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

The Group offers a consulting- led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
R evenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
•  R evenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
•  R evenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
•  In r espect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation.
The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
•  R evenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer.
In cases where  implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method .
•  R evenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.
•  The solutions off ered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software.
In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the  principal or as an agent of the customer.
The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is  acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
R evenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer.
Revenue  also excludes taxes collected from customers.
The Gr oup’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
The  Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  225 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer  to benefit independently from such deliverables.
Judg ement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation.
The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives.
The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant  financing component.
Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for  a distinct product or service from the customer.
The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction  price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.
The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations  to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.
The Gr oup exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period  of time.
The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls  the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such  product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
Con tract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation.
Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less.
The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.
Con tract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts.
Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of  time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and de ferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
The billing schedules agr eed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments.
Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
In acc ordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
Con tracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements.
The Group reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new  performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change.
In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
The Gr oup disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.
R evenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Consultancy services 2,23,332 1,90,289 Sale of equipment and software licences  2,126  1,465  2,25,458 1,91,754  R evenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).
While disclosing the ag gregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially  satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the  Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115.
Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price  allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised  corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  226 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Unsa tisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations,  changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc).
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,38,231 crore  out of which 53.17% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter .
No consideration from  contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the  changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with  a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service cost, both vested and  unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the  entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
The r etirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations  reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available  refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The Gr oup provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are  treated as defined benefit plans.
De fined contribution plans  Con tributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to  such benefits.
The Gr oup provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined  contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  228 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Short -term employee benefits  All emplo yee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee  benefits.
Benefits such as salaries, wages etc.
and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the  employee renders the related service.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be  estimated reliably.
Compensa ted absences  Compensa ted absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee  renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are  not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are  recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date  using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

The e xpected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as  at March 31, 2023.
The Group is expected to contribute `55 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending  March 31, 2024 comprising domestic component of `8 crore and foreign component of `47 crore.
The signific ant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected  salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective  assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the disc ount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023 As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  (265)  (372) Decrease of 0.50%  290  422   If the e xpected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as  follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023 As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50% 155 200 Decrease of 0.50%  (147)  (188) Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  233 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  The sensitivity analy sis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is  unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermor e, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated  using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the  defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
E ach year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are  analysed in terms of risk and return profiles.
Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

This plan is a defined benefit  plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest  rate declared by Government administered provident fund.
A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government  administered pension fund.
The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as  an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.
In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund  liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there  is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected  amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered  provident fund.
All eligible emplo yees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in  which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident  fund plan.
A part of the company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund.
This plan is a defined  contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund.
The contributions  made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Curr ent income taxes  The curr ent income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas.
The  current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable after taking credit for tax relief  available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Curr ent income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the  jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income  tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
The curr ent income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary  in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.
Adv ance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and  income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and  liability on a net basis.
De ferred income taxes  De ferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is  not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
De ferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  236 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  The c arrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
De ferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary  differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled  and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
De ferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
F or operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of  those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after  the tax holiday ends.
De ferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the  relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
De ferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be  available for set off against future current income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will  be realised.

In addition t o above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company  in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential  information and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra.
In April 2016, the Compan y received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of `7,730 crore (US $940 million) to  Epic which was thereafter reduced by the Trial Court to `3,454 crore (US $420 million).
Pursuant to reaffirmation of the  District Court Order in March 2019, the Company filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order .
Epic also  filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `822 crore (US $100 million) award and   `1,645 crore (US $200 million) in punitive damages.
On Augus t 20, 2020, the Appeals Court (a) vacated the award of `2,303 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages  considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to  reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,151 crore (US $140 million), (b) affirmed the District Court’s  decision vacating the jury’s award of `822 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other  confidential information” by the Company, and, (c) affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of   `1,151 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of the comparative analysis by the Company.
Considering  all the facts and various legal precedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided `1,218 crore   (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30,  2020.
This was presented as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Other Information The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the other information.
The other information  comprises the information included in the Company’s annual  report, but does not include the financial statements and  auditor’s report(s) thereon.
The Company’s annual report  is expected to be made available to us after the date of this  auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not  cover the other information and we will not express any form of  assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing  so, consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our  knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the  Standalone Financial Statements The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act  with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs,  profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in  equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India, including  the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under  Section   133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes  maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance  with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets  of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and  other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,  that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the  preparation and presentation of the standalone financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  Management and Board of Directors are responsible for  assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and  using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of  Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  Standalone Financial Statements  |  253 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the  Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not  a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial  statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit.
We also: •  Iden tify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive  to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The  risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Ob tain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances.
Under Section 143(3)(i) of  the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on whether the company has adequate internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements in place and  the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•  E valuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by the Management and Board of  Directors.
•  Conclude on the appr opriateness of the Management  and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis  of accounting in preparation of standalone financial  statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our  conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or  conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as  a going concern.
•  E valuate the overall presentation, structure and content  of the standalone financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the standalone financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any  significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during  our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate  with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where  applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with  governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements  of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law  or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or  when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a  matter should not be communicated in our report because  the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be  expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such  communication.

: 060154 Date: 12 April 2023  ICAI UDIN: 23060154BGXCZS4294 Standalone Financial Statements  |  259 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the  aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of  Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act (Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal  and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even  date) Opinion We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the  Company”) as of 31 March 2023 in conjunction with our audit of  the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year  ended on that date.
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects,  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements and such internal financial controls were operating  effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements  criteria established by the Company considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on  Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the  “Guidance Note”).
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for  Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are  responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial  controls based on the internal financial controls with reference  to financial statements criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note.
These responsibilities include the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring  the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets,  the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under  the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements  based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with  the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed  under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an  audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require  that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial  statements were established and maintained and if such controls  operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements and their operating  effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements included obtaining an  understanding of internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement,  including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement  of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or  error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with  reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to  Financial Statements A company’s internal financial controls with reference to  financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of standalone financial statements for  external purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles.
A company’s internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements include those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records  that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  (2)   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial  statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the standalone  financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with  Reference to Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls  with reference to financial statements, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not  be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal  financial controls with reference to financial statements to  future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial  controls with reference to financial statements may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Compan y is a public limited company incorporated and  domiciled in India.
The address of its corporate office is TCS  House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001.
As at   March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding  company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share  capital.
The Boar d of Directors approved the standalone financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and  authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.
2)  St atement of compliance  These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards  (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to  time.
3)  Basis of pr eparation  These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  on historical cost basis except for certain financial  instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured  at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting  period.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of  the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and  non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle.
Based on the nature of services rendered to customers  and time elapsed between deployment of resources  and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the  consideration for such services rendered, the Company has  considered an operating cycle of 12 months.
The s tatement of cash flows has been prepared under  indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the  effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals  or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or  payments and items of income or expense associated  with investing or financing cash flows.
The cash flows from  operating, investing and financing activities of the Company  are segregated.
The Company considers all highly liquid  investments that are readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in  value to be cash equivalents.
These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared  in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the  Company.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at  exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and  liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing  on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses  arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in  the statement of profit and loss.
Non-monetary assets and  liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in  foreign currencies are not retranslated.
The signific ant accounting policies used in preparation of  the standalone financial statements have been discussed in  the respective notes.
4)  Use of es timates and judgements    The pr eparation of standalone financial statements  in conformity with the recognition and measurement  principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company  to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported  balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent  liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements  and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the  periods presented.
Es timates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised  and future periods are affected.
The Compan y uses the following critical accounting  estimates in preparation of its standalone financial  statements: (a)  R evenue recognition  R evenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method.
The Company uses  judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the  contracts which is used to determine degree of completion  of the performance obligation.
(b)  Use ful lives of property, plant and equipment  The Compan y reviews the useful life of property, plant  and equipment at the end of each reporting period.
This  reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense  in future periods.
(c)  Impairmen t of investments in subsidiaries  The Compan y reviews its carrying value of investments  carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more  frequently when there is indication for impairment.
If the  recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the  impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit  and loss.
(d)  F air value measurement of financial instruments  When the f air value of financial assets and financial  liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be  measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  267 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 fair value is measured using valuation techniques including  the Discounted Cash Flow model.
The inputs to these  models are taken from observable markets where possible,  but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is  required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and  volatility.
Changes in assumptions about these factors could  affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
(e)  Pr ovision for income tax and deferred tax assets  The Compan y uses estimates and judgements based on  the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue,  costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised  while determining the provision for income tax.
A deferred  tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that  future taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be  utilised.
Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement  to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at  the end of each reporting period.
(f)  Pr ovisions and contingent liabilities  The Compan y estimates the provisions that have present  obligations as a result of past events and it is probable  that outflow of resources will be required to settle the  obligations.
These provisions are reviewed at the end  of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the  current best estimates.
The Compan y uses significant judgements to assess  contingent liabilities.
Contingent liabilities are recognised  when there is a possible obligation arising from past events,  the existence of which will be confirmed only by the  occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the Company  or a present obligation that arises from past events where  it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate  of the amount cannot be made.
Contingent assets are  neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial  statements.
(g)  Emplo yee benefits  The acc ounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of  defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions.
These assumptions have been explained under employee  benefits note.
(h)  Leases  The Compan y evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a  lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116.
Identification  of a lease requires significant judgement.
The Company  uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term  (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable  discount rate.
The Compan y determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods  covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company  is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods  covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company  is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.
In  assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an  option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts  and circumstances that create an economic incentive for  the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease,  or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.
The  Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the  non-cancellable period of a lease.
The disc ount rate is generally based on the incremental  borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a  portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.
5)  R ecent pronouncements  Minis try of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard  or amendments to the existing standards under Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to  time.
On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment  Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:  Ind AS 1 – Pr esentation of Financial Statements  The amendmen ts require companies to disclose their  material accounting policies rather than their significant  accounting policies.
Accounting policy information,  together with other information, is material when it can  reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary  users of general purpose financial statements.
The  Company does not expect this amendment to have any  significant impact in its financial statements.
Ind AS 12 – Inc ome Taxes  The amendmen ts clarify how companies account  for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and  decommissioning obligations.
The amendments narrowed  the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15  and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no  longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition,  give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary  differences.
The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in  its financial statements.
Ind AS 8 – Acc ounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors  The amendmen ts will help entities to distinguish between  accounting policies and accounting estimates.
The  definition of a change in accounting estimates has been  replaced with a definition of accounting estimates.
Under  the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary  amounts in financial statements that are subject to  measurement uncertainty”.
Entities develop accounting  estimates if accounting policies require items in financial  statements to be measured in a way that involves  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  268 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 measurement uncertainty.
The Company does not expect  this amendment to have any significant impact in its  financial statements.
6)   Financial asse ts, financial liabilities and equity  instruments  Financial asse ts and liabilities are recognised when the  Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which  are initially measured at transaction price.
Transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or  issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair  value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or  financial liability.
The Compan y derecognises a financial asset only when the  contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire,  or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all  the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another  entity.
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when,  and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged,  cancelled or have expired.
Cash and c ash equivalents  The Compan y considers all highly liquid investments, which  are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are  subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash  equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances  with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and  usage.
Financial asse ts at amortised cost  Financial asse ts are subsequently measured at amortised  cost if these financial assets are held within a business  whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect  contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the  financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest on the  principal amount outstanding.
Financial asse ts at fair value through other  comprehensive income  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through other  comprehensive income if these financial assets are held  within a business whose objective is achieved by both  collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are  solely payments of principal and interest on the principal  amount outstanding and selling financial assets.
The Compan y has made an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments  not held for trading in other comprehensive income.
Financial asse ts at fair value through profit or loss  Financial asse ts are measured at fair value through profit  or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at  fair value through other comprehensive income on initial  recognition.
The transaction costs directly attributable  to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in  statement of profit and loss.
In vestment in subsidiaries  In vestment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less  impairment loss, if any.
Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities ar e measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method.
E quity instruments  An equity ins trument is a contract that evidences residual  interest in the assets of the company after deducting all  of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company  are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue  cost.
Deriv ative accounting  •  Ins truments in hedging relationship    The Compan y designates certain foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts as  hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange  risks.
These hedges are accounted for as cash flow  hedges.
The Compan y uses hedging instruments that are  governed by the policies of the Company which are  approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies  provide written principles on the use of such financial  derivatives consistent with the risk management  strategy of the Company.
The hedg e instruments are designated and  documented as hedges at the inception of the  contract.
The Company determines the existence  of an economic relationship between the hedging  instrument and hedged item based on the currency,  amount and timing of their respective cash flows.
The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce  the risk associated with the exposure being hedged  is assessed and measured at inception and on an  ongoing basis.
If the hedged future cash flows are no  longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have  been accumulated in other equity are immediately  reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the  statement of profit and loss.
The e ffective portion of change in the fair value of the  designated hedging instrument is recognised in the  other comprehensive income and accumulated under  the heading cash flow hedging reserve.
The Compan y separates the intrinsic value and  time value of an option and designates as hedging  instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the  option.
The change in fair value of the intrinsic value  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  269 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 and time value of an option is recognised in the other  comprehensive income and accounted as a separate  component of equity.
Such amounts are reclassified  into the statement of profit and loss when the related  hedged items affect profit and loss.
Hedg e accounting is discontinued when the hedging  instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no  longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or  loss recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity till that time remains and is  recognised in the statement of profit and loss when  the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and  loss.
Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the  statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes  ineffective.
•  Ins truments not in hedging relationship    The Compan y enters into contracts that are effective  as hedges from an economic perspective, but they  do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The change in  the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
Impairmen t of financial assets (other than at fair value)  The Compan y assesses at each date of balance sheet  whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets  is impaired.
Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses  to be measured through a loss allowance.
The Company  recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets  and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a  financing transaction.
In determining the allowances  for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used  a practical expedient by computing the expected credit  loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision  matrix.
The provision matrix takes into account historical  credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking  information.
The expected credit loss allowance is based on  the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance  rates used in the provision matrix.
For all other financial  assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount  equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an  amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the  credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly  since initial recognition.

Carr ying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximate the fair  value due to their nature.
Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities  which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented.
Fair  value measurement of lease liabilities is not required.
Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is  `5,351 crore and `1,470 crore as at  March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (k) F air value hierarchy  The f air value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable  or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:   •  Le vel 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•  Le vel 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either  directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
derived from prices).
•  Le vel 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair values are determined in whole or in  part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market  transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
The c ost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide  range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.
The Boar d of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk  management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Under  the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange  forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks  associated with the financial assets and liabilities.
The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors.
The focus of  the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse  effects on the financial performance of the Company.
Mark et risk  Mark et risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market  prices.
Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes.
The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of  foreign currency exchange rate risk.
•  F oreign currency exchange rate risk    The fluctua tion in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other  comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities  are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company.
Considering the countries and economic  environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in  those countries.
The Compan y, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange.
Further,  any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may  impact the Company’s revenue in international business.
The Compan y evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks.
It  hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.
The f oreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a  simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the  Company.
The f ollowing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet  which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.
Further the exposure as  indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  282 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   •  In terest rate risk     The Compan y’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments.
Hence, the Company is not  significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
Credit risk    Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the  contractual terms or obligations.
Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of  creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks.
Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of  customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.
Financial ins truments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans,  investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets.
Bank  deposits include an amount of `2,428 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which is individually in excess  of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023.
None of the other financial instruments of the  Company result in material concentration of credit risk.
•  Exposur e to credit risk      The c arrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum  exposure to credit risk was `90,655 crore and `90,388 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the  total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference  investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.
The Compan y’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of  outstanding trade receivable and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.
•  Geogr aphic concentration of credit risk     Geogr aphic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows: As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022 Gross% Net% Gross% Net% United States of America  54.14  55.13  52.43  53.78  India  12.03  10.37  12.73  10.68  United Kingdom  15.48  15.80  16.47  16.84      Geogr aphic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on  the location of the customers.
The allo wance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was   `98 crore and `96 crore, respectively.
The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful trade receivables is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Balance at the beginning of the year  1,137  1,082  Change during the year  98  96  Bad debts written off (137) (39) Translation Exchange difference 1 (2) Balance at the end of the year 1,099 1,137  Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  283 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23   Liquidity risk    Liquidity risk r efers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations.

Compan y as a lessee  The Compan y accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the  contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of  the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  286 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  The Compan y recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease  commencement date.
The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial  measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease  incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling  and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located.
The right-of-use asset is  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted  for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
The estimated useful lives of right-of-use  assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment  whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the  statement of profit and loss.
The Compan y measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement  date of the lease.
The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily  determined.
If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate.
For leases with reasonably  similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the  lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole.
The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable  lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to  exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option  to terminate the lease.
The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the  lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect  any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.
The Company recognises the  amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of  profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification.
Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero  and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the  re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.
The Compan y has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease  term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
The lease payments associated with these  leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Compan y as a lessor    A t the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease.
The  Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In  case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate  of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.
When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in  the head lease and the sub-lease separately.
It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use  asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset.
If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the  Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.
If an arr angement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with  customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Compan y does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.
8)  Non- financial assets and non-financial liabilities  (a)  Pr operty, plant and equipment  P roperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing  the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment  loss, if any.
Depr eciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value  over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation.
The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at  the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

P roperty, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying  amounts may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e.
higher of the fair value less cost to  sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely  independent of those from other assets.
In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU)  to which the asset belongs.
If the r ecoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

10)  R evenue recognition  The Compan y earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions.
The Company offers a  consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.
R evenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the  consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
•  R evenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts  expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
•  R evenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide  services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
•  In r espect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of  accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation.
The contract  costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
•  R evenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software  is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer.
In cases where  implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services  and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
•  R evenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the  customer.
•  The solutions off ered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software.
In such cases, revenue for  supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the  principal or as an agent of the customer.
The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is  acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.
R evenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level  credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer.
Revenue  also excludes taxes collected from customers.
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  295 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  The Compan y’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
The  Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.
Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer  to benefit independently from such deliverables.
Judg ement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each  distinct performance obligation.
The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable  consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and  incentives.
The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant  financing component.
Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for  a distinct product or service from the customer.
The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction  price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.
The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations  to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct  performance obligations.
The Compan y exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a  period of time.
The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who  controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of  such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.
R evenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.
Con tract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for  capitalisation.
Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less.
The assessment of  this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be  used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.
Con tract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts.
Contract assets are classified  as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of  time is required, as per contractual terms.
Unearned and de ferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.
The billing schedules agr eed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress  payments.
Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.
In acc ordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the  obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.
Con tracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements.
The Company reviews  modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new  performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change.
In the event transaction price is  revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.
The Compan y disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.
R evenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Consultancy services 1,88,748 1,59,106 Sale of equipment and software licences  1,606  1,235  1,90,354 1,60,341 Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  296 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  R evenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Banking, Financial Services and Insurance  68,240  58,614  Manufacturing  16,905  14,576  Retail and Consumer Business  33,169  26,966  Communication, Media and Technology  33,606  28,778  Life Sciences and Healthcare  22,398  18,341  Others  16,036  13,066  1,90,354 1,60,341  R evenue disaggregation by geography is as follows: (` crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023 Year ended   March 31, 2022 Americas  North Americ a 1,13,208  90,630   La tin America  382  314  Europe  Unit ed Kingdom  30,676  27,595   Con tinental Europe  19,209  17,595  Asia Pacific  12,017  11,178  India  10,941  9,547  Middle East and Africa  3,921  3,482  1,90,354 1,60,341  Geogr aphical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.
In formation about major customers  No single cus tomer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2023 and   March 31, 2022.
While disclosing the ag gregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially)  satisfied performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the  Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115.
Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction  price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised  corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.
Unsa tisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations,  changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc).
The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,13,145 crore  out of which 55.41% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter .
No consideration from  contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the  changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with  a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service cost, both vested and  unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the  entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.
The r etirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations  reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available  refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The Compan y provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which  are treated as defined benefit plans.
De fined contribution plans  Con tributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to  such benefits.
The Compan y provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are  treated as defined contribution plans.
Short -term employee benefits  All emplo yee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee  benefits.
Benefits such as salaries, wages etc.
and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the  employee renders the related service.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be  estimated reliably.
Compensa ted absences  Compensa ted absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee  renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date.
Compensated absences which are  not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are  recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date  using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

The e xpected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan  obligations as at March 31, 2023.
The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year  ending March 31, 2024 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2023.
The signific ant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected  salary increase.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective  assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
If the disc ount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023 As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  (121)  (159) Decrease of 0.50%  127  170   If the e xpected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as  follows: (` crore) As at   March 31, 2023 As at   March 31, 2022 Increase of 0.50%  129  171  Decrease of 0.50%  (123)  (161) Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  303 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  The sensitivity analy sis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is  unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Furthermor e, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated  using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the  defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.
E ach year an Asset - Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are  analysed in terms of risk and return profiles.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Curr ent income taxes  The curr ent income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company having its branches in India and overseas where it  operates.
The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief  available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Curr ent income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the  jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates.
The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income  tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.
Adv ance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and  income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and  liability on a net basis.
De ferred income taxes  De ferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a  business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  306 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  De ferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the  deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
The c arrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
De ferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.
F or operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of  those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after  the tax holiday ends.
De ferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the  relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
De ferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be  available for set off against future current income tax liability.
Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance  sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will  be realised.

TCS leveraged its deep expertise in IoT , advanced analytics,  4 T CFD Governance A and B 5  GRI 2-13 Sustainability Disclosures  |  334 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 and machine learning to come up with a suite of offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™,  IP2™, and TCS Envirozone™.
Clients across industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods are engaging the  company to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas  emissions across their end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling.
Strategy 6 A) Describe the clima te-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.
Current regulation TCS is required to follow all the environmental regulations around emissions, water discharge, waste recycling  etc.
Compliance to these regulations is monitored as part of the company’s risk management function and  integrated into its mitigation plans.
TCS discloses its performance against various environmental parameters  as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated Business Responsibility & Sustainability  Reporting (BRSR) framework, which is a part of this Integrated Annual Report.
Emerging regulation Emerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity  tariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which impact TCS.
Regulations around procurement of  renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolving  in all major geographies.
TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational  sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes.
Technology With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCS  offices eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and  works on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology.
These are considered as operational  risks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient.
Additionally,  TCS is one of the market leaders in the cloud migration opportunity, helping clients migrate their workloads  from owned data centers to hyperscaler clouds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with  those workloads.
Legal TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others)  on a periodic basis and has a robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all  legal requirements of current, amended and new regulations.
Market Climate change is driving a lot of changes in TCS’ customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and new  opportunities, giving the company an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation  journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.
Reputation Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly  aware of climate change related issues.
It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain  TCS’ reputation.
Acute physical Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in  coastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood,  and cyclones.
E.g., The company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are  exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.
Chronic physical Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic  physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood.
Also, with  TCS’s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, Kolkata, rise in sea level and related  impacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are  more likely.
These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure.
6  T CFD Strategy A, B and C. The time horizon considered by TCS during the current year for its assessment of short, medium and  long term are 0 to 5 years, 5 to 10 years and 10 to 20 years respectively.
Sustainability Disclosures  |  335 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 B) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced the organization business, strategy and  financial planning.
Ha ve climate-related  risks and opportunities  influenced your  strategy in this area?
Description of influence Products and  services Yes As TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing  opportunities to provide technology-led solutions to help them achieve their  sustainability goals.
The change in technology consumption reflects the prevailing  trends in the economy.
Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put  the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability  imperative.
Each of these represents an opportunity that can contribute towards the growth of  not just as one company, but of the ecosystem as a whole.
TCS leveraged its deep  expertise in IoT , advanced analytics, and machine learning to come up with a suite of  offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™,  and TCS Envirozone™.
Clients across industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods  are engaging TCS to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy  consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas emissions across their end-to- end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling.
Supply chain and/or  value chain Yes Supply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations  identified by the Company under its sustainability risk.
TCS’s Green Procurement policy  outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable.
Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s  IT and other infrastructure assets procurement as this is directly correlated with TCS’  emission profile.
Climate related risks play a very important role in the company’s supply chain  engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in  carbon performance along with other ESG elements.
Investment in R&D Yes TCS’ investments in research and innovation have resulted in solutions like  Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™.
TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last  few years to reduce its energy consumption and is now offering these to clients to  help them achieve their sustainability goals.

Operations Yes Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations.
The  company has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green  policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure.
TCS’ campuses are designed  to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested  periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption.
Green buildings,  efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon  footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line  with circular economy principles are integral to the company operations.
All these  initiatives are helping TCS achieve its Net Zero target by 2030.
Sustainability Disclosures  |  336 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23  Ha ve climate-related  risks and opportunities  influenced your  strategy in this area?
Description of influence Direct costs, Capital  expenditures, Capital  allocation, Assets Yes TCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement  of Companies Act 2013, on the lines of the globally accepted risk-based framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway  Commission.
The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to  increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing  and implementing a system of internal control.
The framework requires a company  to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.
The company has  successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.
Climate risks and opportunities are the key factors while making financial  considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and  renewable energy.
Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the  company’s overall capital investment.
Major investments are in green buildings, roof  top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives.
In FY 2023 TCS has invested ₹3,063  crore in projects to improve environmental and social impacts.
These investments,  along with other mitigation steps, helped the company reduce its Scope 1 and 2  emissions by 71% from base year 2016.
These initiatives also help the company to  position itself as a leader in the climate domain contributing to TCS’ market value.
C) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2  degree Celsius or lower scenario Climate related   scenario Parameters, assumptions, analytical choices Transition scenarios  IEA B2DS The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk  and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends.
The top-down  analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) nature  loss and ecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customer  and workforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of  externalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes.
Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value  chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification  of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities.
The key value drivers analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain  including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs,  operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End markets (demand for low  carbon services/ products, market share and competition).
In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach  has been selected as its more conservative scenario.
The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs  and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy.
The assumptions used in the analysis  also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand.
Changing customer behavior and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number  of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.
Sustainability Disclosures  |  337 Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Physical climate  scenarios RCP 8.5 The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS had a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and  opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends.
The top-down analysis  of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) nature loss and  ecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customer and  workforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of  externalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes.
Detailed analysis was conducted on a) material climate change physical risks and opportunities across  value chain, and b)assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including  identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities.
The key value drivers’ analysis  assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input  supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/  damage costs due to disruption of operation) & c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products,  market share and competition).
The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario.
The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between  3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps us understand the worst- case climate impacts on our operations.
Inputs for the assessment included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energy  efficiency and solar energy.
The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of  TCS over the years and increased energy demand.
Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include - 1) A robust Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events.
2) Investments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).
