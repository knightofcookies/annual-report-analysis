HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 10 11 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Chairman's Message Dear Stakeholders, Greetings!
It gives me immense pleasure to  present to you the Integrated Annual  Report of our Bank for the financial  year 2022-23.
The year 2022-23 gone by was a  momentous year in many ways.
It  was a year in which the world largely  shook off the effects of the COVID-19  pandemic thus enabling Governments,  businesses and people to rebound  in their activities with renewed zest  and make fresh beginnings and  investments.
At the same time, quite  unexpectedly, it was the year when  the world was buffeted by a surging  geopolitical turmoil, burgeoning  energy prices and inflation, and the  inevitable tightening of the monetary  policies around the globe.
Despite  global headwinds, the Indian economy  continued to demonstrate resilience.
The runway for growth in India,  predominantly driven by the country’s  domestic consumption, remains  immense.
Global investors and India  watchers have acknowledged the  country’s macroeconomic and   financial stability.
For us at HDFC Bank, the year started  with a path breaking announcement  of the merger of our promoter, HDFC  Ltd., one of the largest housing finance  companies of India with the Bank.
This merger was meant to, inter-alia,  transform the Bank to a financial  services conglomerate straddling  key financial services and products,  including housing loan, life and general  insurance, and asset management  amongst others.
The merged entity would benefit  from increased scale, comprehensive  product offering, balance sheet  resilience and the ability to drive  synergies, enhance operating  efficiencies and underwriting  efficiencies, thereby leveraging the  complementary strengths of both  the organisations.
This would enable  the Bank to serve its customers in  a significantly enhanced way with a  bouquet of financial services.
I am happy to inform you that the  merger has now been completed  within our estimated timelines and  focus now shifts on capturing the   full benefits of the synergies and   future proofing the Bank for the  coming decades.
The Integrated Annual Report being  placed before you would once again  demonstrate that the Bank has  achieved over the past financial year,  robust growth in its businesses with  healthy financial performance and  profitability, and it continues to be one  of the best managed banks in terms of  its risk management, non-performing  assets, regulatory compliance and  governance standards.
This reflects  the effectiveness of our governance  culture and the supervision of the  Board.
Let me elaborate on   these themes.
Governance at the core At the Bank we accord tremendous  importance to very high standards of  corporate governance.
This philosophy  rests on the essential principles  of independence, accountability,  responsibility, transparency, fair  and timely disclosures which have  built credibility over the years.
The  various Committees of the Board met  throughout the year giving them an  opportunity to take stock of various  aspects of critical importance to the  Bank.
These Committees enabled  the Board members to perform  their governance and supervisory  duties and have an oversight on the  performance of senior management.
This ensured that your Bank would not  be buffeted by sudden ebbs and flows  of events.
We stand at the  cusp of a New Era Atanu Chakraborty Part-time Chairman and  Independent Di rector   HDFC Bank Limited 12 Review of the Bank’s  performance and  responsibility to society During the year under review, the  Bank has delivered strong growth  while asset quality remains one of the  best in the industry.
The details of our  performance are captured across the  report before you.
It is important to reiterate that the  Bank recognises its responsibility  to the community and society quite  seriously.
This was reflected last  year as we emerged as a leading  contributor in Government schemes,  particularly those which helped the  nation emerge out of the pandemic.
We were the largest participant under  the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee  Scheme (ECLGS) disbursing over  C44,000 Crore and supporting about  1.25 Lakh MSMEs.
In addition,  the Bank continued to increase its  exposure to the agricultural sector and  weaker sections of society.
The Bank's Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) activities and  initiatives on Environmental, Social and  Governance (ESG) parameters remain  important focus areas for the Board.
Future ready: adopting  Information Technology I am happy to inform you that the  Bank management is focused on  result driven investments in IT and  digital transformation of the Bank and  the Committees of the Board spend  considerable time in the evaluation of  the implementation of the IT strategy  of the Bank.
Over the last year we  have focused on strengthening our  core IT infrastructure in terms of high  availability, capacity additions ahead  of time, new Disaster Recovery site  implementation, moving towards hybrid  cloud architecture etc.
All this enables  us to ensure that we are able to run  the Bank and provide our customers  the convenience of availability of our  services round the clock.
Harnessing the Power of One During the last year, we indicated a  timeline of 12 to 18 months for the  merger process to conclude and we  have completed the merger within the  indicated timelines.
Executing a merger  of this scale and complexity would  not have been possible without the  immense support and co-operation  received from the Government of India,  Reserve Bank of India, Competition  Commission of India, Securities and  Exchange Board of India, Insurance  Regulatory and Development Authority  of India, National Company Law  Tribunal and all the other agencies.
They have helped us navigate through  the complexities of this merger and  on behalf of the Board of Directors of  HDFC Bank, I extend a deep sense of  gratitude to all of them.
I would also like to thank   Shri Deepak Parekh for the role   he has played in nurturing HDFC  and its group companies with great  passion and commitment over four  and a half decades.
The Bank is now fully poised to  take the benefits of the merger.
The  entities have formed an Integration  Committee that has been working on  various streams across businesses,  IT, HR, Risk Management, Operations,  Compliance, etc.
to make t he merger  seamless and effective.
We are also  putting in place the strategy to ensure  that the financial c onglomerate t hat  has emerged has in place adequate  systems and processes to ensure  adherence t o the various regulatory  regimes and a governance framework  for meeting group wide compliance  and risk management objectives.
The  shareholders a nd other stakeholders  are now part of a world class financial  conglomerate and we expect  that by  this time next year we would  be well  positioned to see the benefits of the  Power of One.
In conclusion, I would like to say that  we stand at the cusp of a new era  which will define our fut ure; a future  in which I have full confidence of  demonstrating growth, stability and  serving ou r burgeoning p an India  customer base even better.
Atanu Chakraborty Part-time Chairman and  Independent Director HDFC Bank Limited HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 13 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Message from the MD & CEO For us in India, we can see that our  economy has been resilient and we  as a country have managed these  after effects pretty well, by the speed  and scale of our vaccination and the  deft economic and monetary policy  initiatives by the Government and the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Coming to our Bank, the year started  with a path breaking announcement  of our intent to merge HDFC Ltd. with  the Bank.
I am happy to report that the  merger has come into effect from   July 1, 2023.
I will share further details  on this significant milestone in our  history, further down.
Macroeconomic Environment A prominent global publication referred  to the post-pandemic economy like  the Mona Lisa.
Each time you look,  you see something different.
It was felt  that perhaps the world is simply more  volatile.
However, the good news for  us is that India remained one of the  fastest growing large economies in the  world and an engine of global growth.
We did not have to contend with such  uncertainties.
The Indian economy  exhibited robust resilience in 2022-23  recording a growth of 7.2 per cent,  which was the highest among major  economies of the world.
This achievement comes in a scenario  where global economic growth is  expected to moderate on account  of monetary tightening in developed  economies, the crisis in the US  regional banking sector and the  continuing war in Ukraine.
India is predicted to grow around 6 per  cent in the current financial year.
This  is lower than last year’s growth but is  still much higher than what is projected  for many developed economies.
The  recession fears in major economies  and expected slowdown in export  growth means that India cannot  remain entirely insulated from global  pressures.
However, the domestic  resilience as reflected in 2022-23 is an  indicator that India is likely to withstand  future headwinds.
This brings me to  the India story.
The merger perhaps could  not have been better timed  Dear Stakeholders, Warm greetings to you all.
The year gone by was one in  which the world moved away  from the new normal to the  normal.
The pandemic is largely  over.
However, the after effects  of  decisions made during those  trying and unusual times have  left behind a lot of issues for the  world to address.
This includes  higher inflation and resultant  monetary tightening, and the  regional banking crisis in Europe  and USA.

It is a story of  demographics, education, digitisation,  rising incomes and aspirations and  geopolitical developments coming  together to give the country a once  in a lifetime opportunity.
It starts  with demographics.
About half our  population is below the age of 35.
India’s working age population (15-64  years) is expected to rise and peak  close to 65 per cent by 2030 and  thereafter stabilise.
The proficiency  of Indians in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)  coupled with their felicity with the  English language gives India a clear  differentiator.
Next comes the Government’s rollout  of digital infrastructure - the largest  such in the world.
The result is that  India has taken the lead when it  comes to digital transactions.
More  than 40 per cent of these transactions  are from India.
This also fuels further  aspirations as the Internet is a clear  leveller when it comes to information.
Through mobiles, laptops, PCs, and  social media, Indians have similar  access to information in major cities  and in the heartland.
This in turn is  being backed by increasing purchasing  power with a per capita income of  $2,000.
So, the demand for consumer  goods and financial services is  expected to increase exponentially.
The other consumption enabler is the  Government’s rationalisation of income  tax slabs which will put more money  in the hands of people in lower income  brackets.
On the investment side,  the increase in Government capital  expenditure should crowd in private  sector investment as well.
Global  geopolitical developments too favour  India.
All these create the necessary  climate for India to get a much larger  share of the foreign investment pie,  emerge as a global production hub  and become an $8 trillion economy  in about a decade, from $3.5 trillion.
Naturally, this also acts as an enabler  for growth in financial services which  is under penetrated and underserved.
India’s housing story will also feed off  this growth and the merger could not  have perhaps come at a better time.
The Merger Last year I had explained the rationale  for the merger.
To quickly recapitulate,  this was an opportunity that we truly  believed in.
Buying a home is a family  decision and an emotional one.
This  emotion is transferred to the home  loan service provider and helps build  lifelong bonds with the customer and  his family.
Also, only 2 per cent of our  customers source their home loans  through the Bank, while 5 per cent do  it from other institutions.
This itself is a  huge opportunity.
It is this bond with the customer  that the Bank would like to build on.
HDFC Bank with its stronger digital  platforms, digital journeys and physical  branch network will have the ability  to offer the home loan customer a  complete bouquet of the Bank’s and  subsidiaries’ products and services.
Savings accounts, personal loans,  insurance cover, SIPs can all be  bundled along with a home loan to  create a compelling value proposition  to the customer, that probably does  not exist in the market at the scale at  which this is envisaged.
Going forward  this is clearly going to be a game  changer.
As India grows, home buying across  the country will only accelerate and  emerge as a key driver of India’s GDP  over the next decade, especially  affordable housing.
Investments  in infrastructure are vital for India’s  growth.
A bigger balance sheet post- merger will enable HDFC Bank to take  a larger exposure in infrastructure  HDFC Bank with its stronger digital platforms,  digital journeys and physical branch network will  have the ability to offer the home loan customer a  complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries'  products and services.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 15 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Message from the MD & CEO In my letter to you in the last two years,  I had highlighted my key focus areas.
These are: improving technology  resilience, a clear focus on three Cs:  Culture, Conscience and Customer  and building for the future.
Let me now elaborate on these.
Technology Update: HDFC Bank is today in the midst of  a technology transformation exercise  that focuses both on building the Bank  of the future as well as running the  Bank.
For me, the focus on technology  upgrade and digital transformation are  central to achieving growth as well as  excellence in customer service.
We are focusing on two foundational  aspects.
First, transforming the Bank  through new platforms and customer  experiences offered by the best-in- class products and services through  our digital factories.
Second, running  the Bank efficiently by reinforcing our  core technologies with enhanced  performance and resilience at scale,  through the enterprise factory.
Our  digital transformation journey is being  powered by building competencies  within the Bank.
The factory approach  is focused on leveraging new-age  tech such as AI/ML, cloud-native  architecture, API-driven banking  as well as pioneering industry- first initiatives through emerging  technologies such as generative AI  enablement across banking domains.
Some of our flagship programmes  focused on our customers are  enumerated below: • Our modernised PayZapp 2.0  arrives with a variety of quality-of- life improvements while offering  convenience, security, and a  wide array of payment options at  customers’ fingertips.
This will drive  our acquisition of New To Bank  customers.
• SmartHub has grown into the  preferred banking platform for  merchants with over 1.5 million  using the app, handling over 18 lakh  transactions daily.
• Our Bank One Program is a  cloud-native platform powered by  conversational AI & ML capabilities  offering our customers a unified  banking experience across channels.
With multilingual bots covering ~40  per cent of customer interactions,  the platform has significantly boosted  efficiencies and reduced resolution  times.
• Our Acquisition Platform enables  a smoother and more consistent  customer experience for purchase  of the Bank’s retail products on the  Bank’s platforms and has facilitated  more than 5 million products being  availed by our customers.
• Xpress Car Loan has evolved  into India’s single largest digital  loan platform for origination and  disbursement with over 50,000  happy customers.
• Smart Saathi, our most recent  launch, digitally enables our network  of Business Correspondents and  Business Facilitators by providing  them an omnichannel experience of  our digital products.
• The Bank has driven various industry- first innovations through programmes  such as Digital Cattle Finance, Digital  Rupee, OfflinePay, Digi-Passbook,  exploration of AI / ML based data  extraction and signature verification.
• On the Corporate Banking front,  the Bank hosts Corporate Banking  eXchange (CBX) which is one of  the largest corporate transactions  platforms and a state-of-the-art Trade  Finance platform.
Our conscious effort has been  to launch in small scale, listen to  customer feedback, build acceptance  projects.
This means we can  participate more meaningfully in India’s  growth story and contribute to nation  building.
In light of all this, the pace at  which we aim to grow - we could be  creating a new HDFC Bank every   4 years.
The merger would of course not have  been possible without the support and  guidance of the regulatory authorities  including RBI, SEBI, CCI, IRDAI, BSE,  NSE, PFRDA and NCLT.
I would like to  take this opportunity to thank all   of them.
Now, to come to our performance.
Our Performance As a Bank our performance has been  consistent across business cycles.
We  have grown our Balance Sheet and  Net Profit while maintaining our   asset quality.
Our Balance Sheet grew by 19.2 per  cent to `24,66,081 crore and Net Profit  increased 19.3 per cent to ` 44,108.7  crore.
Net Interest Income increased  by 20.6 per cent to `86,842.2 crore.
GNPA decreased to 1.12 per cent  from 1.17 per cent.
We have been able  to maintain a stable NIM at 4.1 per  cent (4.3 per cent on interest earning  assets) despite deposits growing  by 20.8 per cent on account of low  cost of funds.
The Return on Assets  (ROA) was 2.07 per cent while Return  on Equity was 17.4 per cent.
Our  commitment to shareholders remained  high with a proposed dividend pay-out  of `19 per equity share of ` 1/- which  translates to a dividend pay-out ratio  of 24.07 per cent of the profits for the  financial year ended March 31, 2023.
I am pleased to state that the Bank’s  performance continued to be robust  during FY 2022-23 with sustained  growth across the Wholesale, Retail  and Commercial and Rural Banking  businesses.
16 through word of mouth before we fully  scale.
We will continue to invest in  technology for improving our customer  experience.
Parallelly, our core technology is  being reinforced through the power of  cloud for improved resilience, scale,  and agility.
We have migrated our  data centres to new state-of-the-art  facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru.
We continue to focus on upgrading  our infrastructure with an Active-Active  architecture for greater availabilities  and high-performance apps.
The  'Hollowing the Core' programme is  set to transform the way core banking  is operated.
Basis the investments  made, we have seen a significant  improvement in our resilience and  uptime (basis both internal and  external public sources) metrics.
However, we are not perfect and we  will continue to further strengthen our  core IT infrastructure.
Our competency factories are  maturing into innovation labs and  are increasingly partnering with the  Government institutions and FinTechs  to develop prototypes of the next  wave of digital banking products.
For  instance, we are leveraging generative  AI for structured and unstructured data  extraction from documents, developing  AI-based instant credit decisioning  models and significantly improving  fraud monitoring through real-time self- monitoring ML models.
Attracting and developing the best  engineering talent with new-age tech  skill sets is a top priority for us to lead  into the next age of neo-banking.
The  Bank is strategically positioning itself to  capitalise on new opportunities which  are poised to revolutionise banking  and is making technology investments  for the future.
A steady growth of  strategic investments in emerging  tech and partnerships will ensure that  HDFC Bank stays ahead of the curve  in driving innovations and industry  benchmarks.
Customer Centricity, Service  First Culture and People Every decision of ours is an endeavour  to increase the benefits it brings to our  stakeholders.
A service first culture has always been  one of the anchors of the Bank’s  growth story.
It starts with taking care  of our employees who in turn take care  of our customers.
I have personally travelled across  the country in private buses, with  colleagues across levels travelling  with me.
This has given me the  opportunity to meet employees as well  as customers across multiple locations  in the country.
These interactions  have enriched my understanding and  view of the locations visited and the  myriad opportunities that exist in this  vast country.
I am energised by the  talent and passion that our frontline  colleagues display during these  interactions and also give us enough  ideas to work on.
This is something   I will continue.
In order to institutionalise and measure  a Service First Culture, we have  implemented an at scale episodic  bottom-up Net Promoter System  (NPS).
This allows us to get a real  time customer feedback on their  interactions with the Bank and helps  us draw up plans to keep improving  in the areas where we are still not  up to the mark.
I am happy to report  a consistent increase in our Net  Promoter Score for the Bank as a  whole, year on year and this augurs  well.
I accept that we may not be  perfect with our customer interactions  all the time, and this is one area, I  and the entire Bank are focused on  improving day in and day out.
We  are digitising many of the Customer  Service interactions at a fast pace and  I firmly believe that this  will provide the  impetus to keep improving our Service  First culture.
In addition, we constantly benchmark  ourselves with our compet ition to learn  and better ourselves.
HDFC  Bank  continues to lead the overall brand  NPS ranking ( independent t hird-party  survey) among 20+ compet itors in the  banking category for the second year  in a row.
We have also developed a unique  Service Quality Index (SQI)  for our  key customer facing channels w hich  measures t he performance o f these  channels o n critical customer service  parameters and helps improve on the  same.
The complaints trend indicates  that digital f rauds are increasing,  particularly targeting a vulnerable  section of consumers.
We a re  committed to help safeguard  customers by way of incre asing  awareness amongst people and  improving our technology tools.
The initiative of Vigil Aunt y to promote  awareness amongst cu stomers about  cyber frauds has been wel l received  and we would further in vest in this  area.
In terms of techno logy  investments to prevent frau ds,  the Bank has invested in w rapper,  device binding, devic e assurance and  multi-factor authentication  and would  continue to invest to prot ect our  customers.
As a Bank we are making pr ogress on  our Customer Service, bu t I believe  that this journey has to be accelerated  every year.
More remains to be done  and I am fully committ ed to improving  our customer centrici ty further.
A Service First culture i s not possible  without an organisational cul ture that  acts as the foundation for the same.
Let me dwell on this here.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 17 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Message from the MD & CEO Culture Culture defines the experience of  each employee.
Managers are in  the unique position to represent the  culture the Bank stands for.
Talent,  Potential and Capabilities can best  be harnessed through an enabling  culture.
Towards this the Bank has  adopted the managerial behaviour  architecture - Nurture, Care and  Collaborate.
This encapsulates what  we espouse in our Culture Framework  – the HDFC Bank Way and translates it  into simple behaviours that managers  can demonstrate in their interactions  with their teams.
The Nurture, Care,  Collaborate initiative that covered over  12,000+ managers in the previous year  was extended to the senior leadership  levels and over 6,000 new managers  in FY 2022-23.
The intent is to have  all managers at the Bank equipped to  fully live the cultural ethos of the Bank.
I am fully conscious of the fact that  there may be instances where some  people managers might transgress  our defined way of working.
We have  the resolve to nip this in the bud, both  by way of training/counselling and  appropriate action, to ensure that  the same is not attempted by anyone  else.
Having said that, we have some  distance to traverse on this front.
We  are taking concrete steps towards  building an INCLUSIVE organisation,  which will go a long way in reining in  attrition in the coming years.
The Bank has experienced an increase  in attrition over the last financial year  and a significant part of which was  in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels  (which includes Sales Officers).
One reason that can be attributed  towards this increase, is a post- COVID phenomenon, that may have  prompted the younger workforce to  recalibrate what they ‘want from their  lives’.
This has led to increased attrition  across all sectors.
It is a reality that all  major employers are grappling with,  especially in the BFSI sector.
However, we are cognizant that the  experience of working with HDFC  Bank can be better on several counts,  especially culture.
The Bank upholds  RESPECT for ALL as a fundamental  tenet in the way we work with each  other and our customers.
Listening is vital to understanding  the sentiment of an organisation and  thus we launched Pulse, a real time  feedback platform for employees to  share candid feedback.
This platform  is completely anonymous, and we’ve  already launched 20 surveys to check  the sentiment of the employees  on topics like Work Life Harmony,  Pleasant Parenthood, Future Banker  Program and Onboarding Experience,  to name a few.
We continue to listen,  learn, and act on the feedback so that  we can improve our work environment  and people practices in order to  provide space for all our employees to  excel, thrive and have a long, fulfilling  career at the Bank.
Skilling our people continuously is  another important area that I am  focused on.
We challenge people  with continuous job rotations and  assignments outside of their core  areas, along with on the job and  specialised training where needed.
We will continue to do more on   this path.
Building for the Future In the last two years, I have spoken  about Project Future Ready, to  catalyse, create and capture the next  wave of growth.
The following growth  engines had been identified: Corporate  Banking, Commercial (MSME)  and Rural Banking, Government  and Institutional Business, Wealth  Management, Retail Assets and  Payments, to be driven by our delivery  channels of Branch Banking, Tele- Sales/Service/Relationship and Digital  Marketing.
These can be categorised  as Business Verticals and Delivery  Channels.
Underlying all this will be our  technology and digital platforms.
We have seen progress in our strategy.
The Commercial and Rural Banking  loans have grown by 29.8 per cent.
Your Bank is today the largest SME  Bank in the country and has grown  this book by adhering to stringent  underwriting standards.
We have grown the Corporate and  other Wholesale loans by 12.6 per  cent while maintaining a healthy  ROA.
We have expanded our wealth  management services to over 900  locations.
Our domestic retail loans  have grown by 20.8 per cent without  compromising on asset quality.
Our  payments business continues to  perform well, and we continue to enjoy  a leadership position there.
Branch Banking is the fulcrum of our  customer relationships, and we believe  that a physical branch is extremely  important to customers especially in  semi urban and rural locations.
In FY  2022-23, we added a record 1,479  branches, a majority of which are in  semi urban and rural (SURU) locations.
We plan to add another 675 this year in  SURU locations that will take the total  number of branches in these locations  to over 5,000.
Overall, the Bank plans  to add 1,500 to 2,000 additional  branches during the year.
The concept  of phygital branches will help us to  be agile in meeting customer needs  through digital transactions and at the  same time give customers a sense  of engagement and security with a  physical touchpoint.
Going forward,  18 the new branches, we believe, will be  key to additional deposit mobilisation.
An increasing customer base needs  to be engaged and managed and our  investment on Virtual Relationship  Management is delivering on what we  are building it for.
Digital Marketing has helped  increase the traffic by 35 per cent  on our digital properties.
The traffic  has been harnessed leveraging  advanced analytics and our new  digital acquisition platform, resulting  in direct business generation across  all retail products of the Bank, selling  directly more than 3.8 million products.
I expect the pace of growth of this  channel to further increase and also  encompass practically all service  interactions as we move forward.
Our technology transformation  initiatives coupled with our core  enabling functions of Internal Audit,  Credit and Underwriting, Risk  Management and Compliance/ Governance continue to be integral to  the health and growth of the Bank.
Environment, Social and  Governance Strategy (ESG) According to the United Nations, the  world is now warming faster than at  any point in recorded history.
While this  calls for global action, as a Bank we  are contributing to this in our way.
Two  years back, we committed to become  carbon neutral by 2031-32.
We have  formulated and are implementing a  strategy towards achieving this with  interim milestones.
ESG is being made an integral part  of our credit assessment process.
Assessment of environment and  social factors has been a part of  credit diligence, particularly in project  financing above a certain threshold  for many years now.
This has been  strengthened further through a  comprehensive ESG and Climate  Change assessment framework  in corporate lending.
This is still at  an early stage as right now we are  focused on increasing awareness  among our corporate borrowers and  understanding where they are in their  ESG journey.
Going forward, we would  be looking to make it one of the key  criteria in credit decisioning.
In the  last financial year, we have financed  6,110 MW of renewable energy  capacity.
Over 940 of our branches  have been green certified and all our  future branches will conform to green  building standards.
The overarching  vision is in place for ESG, and we  continue to make steady progress on  this.
Not only do we believe in leading  responsibly but are also committed  to being responsible social citizens.
Through our CSR initiatives under  Parivartan, we have potentially  impacted over 9.93 crore lives.
In  FY 2022-23, around 500 projects  were executed through 250+  Implementation Partners spread  across 27 states of the country.
The  impact of our projects is tracked  internally and externally through impact  assessment studies.
We continue to take affirmative steps  towards being a more inclusive  organisation.
The Bank is committed  to fostering Diversity and Inclusion.
We have prioritised our focus on  two aspects of diversity - Gender  and Persons with Disabilities (PwD).
Women comprising 25 per cent of our  workforce by 2025 is an aspiration  that we are actively pursuing.
We have  been steadily making progress towards  this goal and 23 per cent of our  colleagues are women.
We continue to  maintain gender equity with respect to  pay, promotions and elevations.
Good corporate governance is a  product of culture and conscience,  and this is vital for the long-term  sustainability of the organisation.
Our  focus on compliance and assurance  functions is unwavering and we  continue to strengthen the checks and  balances through these.
Conclusion The year started with the  announcement of the intent to merge  with HDFC Ltd.
This has now been  concluded within the anticipated  timelines.
While this gives the Bank a  strong runway for future growth, it also  helps us contribute to nation building  by helping more Indians buy a home  and secure jobs.
And yes, help the  economy grow further.
I end by expressing my heartfelt  gratitude to our Board members  for their guidance, supervision,  unwavering support and belief in our  abilities.
Finally my gratitude to all my  colleagues for their contribution not  just for the year gone by but also for  their efforts over the years, making the  Bank count amongst the world’s finest  financial institutions.

They  also cross-sell various products of  the Bank and cater to the personal  banking needs of promoters and family  members.
In the rural segment, the Bank is  planning to expand its services to  2.5 Lakh villages in the next two  years.
It funds not only traditional  agriculture but also allied activities.
It  is totally committed to furthering the  Government’s agenda by supporting  its various schemes be it AIF/FPO/ PMFME, and lending to small and  marginal farmers.
HDFC Bank is the leading player in the  commercial vehicle and commercial  equipment financing business with its  share increasing considerably in the  year ended March 31, 2023.
This is a  result of the Bank’s focus on gaining  market share by expanding into deeper  geographies and hiring more feet on  street.
Further, the Bank is working on  an ecosystem to expand its business  under the Transportation Finance  business.
The Commercial and Rural Banking  vertical shall continue contributing  to the Bank's growth as well as the  nation’s growth through its bouquet of  products and services.
Emerging growth engine The Bank's Commercial  and Rural Banking (CRB)  group was set up in  May 2021 to cater to  the needs of the Micro,  Small and Medium  Enterprises (MSME),  emerging corporates,  commercial agriculture,  small and marginal  farmers, healthcare  finance, equipment  finance and commercial  transport companies.
While these are different  businesses, the common  thread binding them is  that they all have a huge  footprint in Semi Urban  and Rural (SURU) India.
As has the Bank with  about half its branches  in SURU locations.
This vertical is also important as its  disbursals help the Bank in meeting  a large part of the Priority Sector  Lending requirements, apart from it  being a high Return On Assets (ROA)  business group for the Bank.

Based on internal discussions and  brainstorming sessions with our  relevant stakeholders, we further  shortlisted 16 topics which were  subsequently shared with internal and  external stakeholders through two sets  of customised questionnaires.
In the  first stage, the responses within each  group were consolidated to derive the  priorities for the respective groups.
In  the next stage, the responses across  different buckets were consolidated by  assigning weights to each stakeholder  group in consultation with our ESG  team.
The collective scores thus  derived were then used to prioritise the  topics assessed as Most important,  Important and Less important.
Our materiality map was developed  by consolidating the inputs provided  by all our major stakeholders.
The  map highlights the crucial economic,  social, environmental, and governance  issues that are relevant to both us and  our stakeholders.
These changes in  the material topics reflect our evolving  priorities in response to stakeholder  feedback: Understanding our priorities Materiality mapping  process To comply with the  latest GRI Universal  Standards 2021, we  performed a materiality  assessment in FY23  to discern and assess  the issues that hold  the utmost importance  for our business and  stakeholders.

Strategy in Action The Bank's long-term goal is to be  the primary banker to customers  and provide them with a wide  range of products as well as build  deep relationships.
Our distribution  footprint is expanding as planned  with continued addition of branch  network overlaying with our digital  capabilities.
Our Risk Management  Framework has stood the test of time  for over two decades and is one of  our key strengths and differentiators.
The merger of HDFC Limited and  HDFC Bank should further enable  the combined entity to enhance its  engagement with customers and  deepen customer relationships.
Our future-ready strategy India continues to be underserved  and underpenetrated in terms of  financial services, presenting an  exciting opportunity for growth in  the financial services industry.
We  remain steadfast in our commitment  to delivering consistent results by  balancing quantity and quality.
The  Bank witnessed healthy growth  across its three segments: Retail  Banking, Commercial and Rural  Banking, and Corporate and other  Wholesale Banking while delivering  consistent profitability and maintaining  asset quality.

The Bank continues to transform itself  into a deeper and engaged customer-centric organisation by focusing on key priorities to drive viz., employee first,  customer first and technology first.
As we recognise the increasing shift  towards digital transactions, we  envision the transformation of retail  branches into engagement centres.
Rather than being solely transactional,  branches will serve as platforms  for meaningful conversations with  customers.
We aim to provide holistic,  need-based financial solutions by  leveraging our diverse range of  products and services.
To achieve  this, we have identified the following  strategic imperatives for re-imagining  the role and architecture of Retail  Branch Banking: Customer Service  and Experience Strengthening  Compliance Effective Risk  Management Zero Paper, Zero  Touch Operations Culture People Learning   and Development Customer acquisition Delivery of products and services Relationship management Customer  Lifecycle  Engagement Service First Digital  Transformation Micro market  focused  multi format  distribution  science Al Analytics  driven customer  conversations  (Next Best Action) Customer life  centric insight led  propositions Growth  segments:  Rural,  Government STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES Virtual Relationship  Management (VRM) Technology   and Digital Leadership in  the Payments  Business Retail  Assets Expanding Wealth  Management Re-imagining the  branch channel Digital  Marketing Heartland:  Commercial   and Rural HDFC Bank edge  for Corporate  Cluster Capturing flows  from Government  and Institutional  (G&I) Business HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 39 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Micro-market focused multi  format distribution We are transforming branch banking  into a multi-format model based on a  granular micro market approach.
This  involves using a multi-variate model  to identify high potential markets,  considering factors such as population  demographics, deposits and advances  data, delinquency insights, climate  risk assessments, and future trends.
Branch formats may vary from full- service phygital branches to smart  banking lobbies or digital banking  units with self-service kiosks, as well  as business correspondent-based  models.
Our approach has led to an  80% expansion in high potential pin  codes.
We closely track profitability  and break-even for each format to  ensure targeted investments and  cost-effectiveness.
By expanding our  presence in identified locations through  multiple formats, we not only increase  our catchment area but also benefit  from network effects.
Therefore, we  continue to invest in expanding our  presence in identified locations through  multiple formats.
Medium-term Goal   (in 24 months) To have a presence in  • 711 Districts (Current as on  March 2023: 697) • 6,000 Cities/ Towns (Current as  on March 2023: 4,080) • Based on need-based and  appropriate format Customer lifecycle  engagement and AI driven  customer conversations We leverage our extensive branch  network as engagement centres to  have high impact conversations with  the customer to partner with them  over the long term.
We source the right  customers through a differentiated  go-to-market approach and engage  in need-based conversations, offering  tailored product propositions.

Digital solutions - A key  driver of Government and  Institutional business The growth in Government and  Institutional business was enhanced  by offering value-added digital  solutions.
A solution penetrated  account maintains two to three  times the average monthly balance  versus a non-penetrated account.
For  example, a gram panchayat enabled  with solutions for tax collections has  deposit value of 6.5X versus a non- solution penetrated account.
Likewise,  an education institution has 30X the  value when it is enabled with solutions  for collections, and pay-outs.

Nurture Tech Talent- Develop the  right talent pool  The first two streams focus on  building the line functions through  building customer-facing neo banking  experiences and frictionless journeys  backed by a resilient core and a cloud  native architecture built for scale.
While we still have some way to go, we  are already seeing the benefits of the  investments in these streams through  some of our success stories across  Heartland: Commercial  and Rural Under the Commercial and Rural  Banking (CRB) segment, our aim is to  support the growth and success of  Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises  (MSMEs) by providing access to  credit and other financial solutions  and services.

committed to resolving challenges  such as limited credit access, high  borrowing costs, and collateral  constraints that are faced by this  sector.
Our lending activities under  this segment play a significant role in  meeting our Priority Sector Lending  (PSL) obligations.
The CRB segment  not only contributes to profitability of  the Bank but also aids in achieving its  inclusion goals, with over 70% of the  core PSL for the Bank as on March 31,  2023 contributed by the CRB group.
The goals in CRB are three-fold.
- To  increase PSL lending, to grow the  book and to generate income along  with maintaining portfolio quality.
Our  Bank’s PSL lending comprises 46% of  our total book of which 36% is organic.
CRB group has been clocking an  average of approximately 29% Y-O-Y  growth for the past eight quarters, with  a GNPA of 1.5% which is one of the  lowest in the industry.

We see this potential as  trends shift from pre-crop working  capital financing to agri infrastructure  financing.
Further as envisioned,  we have built a strong portfolio of  diverse offerings across high income  agri products such as dairy and  horticulture.
Under agriculture finance,  we currently have a presence in 1.65  Lakh villages and we aim to reach 2.25  Lakh villages by the end of FY24.
We are currently the no.1 in the  transportation finance business.
We aim to grow this multi-fold by  Retail Assets Our Retail Assets strategic pillar has  three key tenets for future growth.
Our strategy is to continually enhance  digital offerings across all our retail  assets to do this at prices attuned to  our risk appetite and to consistently  maintain our portfolio quality at high  levels.
Our retail assets portfolio consists  of both secured and unsecured  lending products such as auto loans,  personal loans, gold loans, loans  against property and other retail loans.
Our focus is to provide customer  delight through in-house solutions  that provide us a competitive edge.
Our key indigenous digital products  such as Xpress Car loans, 10 Second  Personal loans, Digital loan against  shares, and Digital loan against  Mutual funds, among others, enable  not only our existing customers but  also new to bank customers to avail  loans in a seamless manner.
While  we continue to innovate and enhance  our digital offerings, we have ensured  robust analytics and risk management  capabilities to back these offerings.
Risk Management is at the core of our  product offerings; further there are  offerings in new and under-penetrated  equipment category as well as non  equipment financing.
We will do  this by leveraging our strong OEM  relationships, common distribution  channels, geographies and customer  base across our existing portfolio and  presence.
Digital journeys and digitisation is a  key enabler for growth in this segment.
We continue to digitise a major part  of CRB business.
We are digitising  customer touchpoints, document  collection processes, sales service  and others, encompassing the entire  customer journey at the Bank.
We have  enabled self-service digital capabilities  across all our branches.
Going  forward, we aim to build capabilities  for digital underwriting through data  management and APIfication.
The segment that the CRB group  serves has a tremendous market  potential and the Bank is in an  excellent position to capitalise on this  opportunity through our extensive  reach, innovative capabilities and  digital prowess.

Our delinquency levels are one of the  lowest in the industry despite being the  market leader in most segments.
We  have built-in processes and controls  and invested in our branch network  to manage the risks associated with  loans.
We have taken specific steps in  this regard with the intent to grow our  Gold Loan portfolio.
Going forward, we are looking to tap  into Government employees as a  major target segment for our products,  and are also excited about the New  to Bank (NTB) 10 sec loans to be  launched in the coming quarters.
As we move forward with the merger,  we aim to capitalise on and retain the  strengths of HDFC Limited combined  with the strengths of the Bank to  ensure a best-in-class home loan  offering.

In  addition, we are also focussing on  new to bank acquisitions through  engagement with large corporates,  targetting Government undertakings  and MNCs to expand our reach.
We  aim to capitalise on the Government  infrastructure push and production- linked incentive scheme (PLI) which will  open up incremental opportunity for  the banking sector.
We have also put  in place a liability strategy to improve  wallet share through our transaction  banking, viz, cash management,  payments, and trade solutions.
Supply  chain financing is also a key growth  driver for the Bank.
We are bolstering  this through the use of technology  such as our supply chain platform  that acts as a one-stop shop for  transaction needs, as well as the  development of need-based offerings.
In the current year, we have embarked  on strategic digital transformation  to further widen and deepen wallet  share from Corporates by enhancing  Employee Experience (EX), Customer  Engagement (CE) and creating an  ecosystem for seamless banking.
We  are enhancing employee experience  through the launch of platforms  enabling an end-to-end journey for  the relationship managers, actionable  analytics, pricing intelligence and  dashboard automation.
On the  customer front, we are shifting from  a product focus to an ecosystem  approach and investing in enabling  ERP integration across functions.
Through these initiatives, we are  re-imagining the corporate cluster to  function as a digital corporate bank.
We believe the runway is long and  our aim is to serve Corporates with  the entire gamut of products and  services and capitalise on the benefit  of synergies across our Bank.

On the back of the Customer First  and Service First Culture, the Bank  follows a three-pronged approach  to wealth management focusing  on the relationship manager, the  service relationship manager, and the  investment analyst.
The relationship  manager acts as a single point of  contact for the customer while the  service relationship manager enables  a service first culture catering to all  the service needs of the customer.
The investment analyst also plays  a key role through robust research  and review of asset allocation and  portfolio management, thus ensuring  wealth creation.

Strategy in Action 50 Digital Marketing Our digital marketing strategy focuses  on creating brand awareness and  building brand loyalty for our financial  solutions and services.
It also aims to  convert the purchasing behaviour of  our customers to adopt unassisted  digital journeys both for improving  customer experience as well as saving  costs to the Bank.
To achieve this, we  deeply analyse customer behaviour  and preferences, identify cohorts for  pitching the most relevant products  services, personalise their experiences  on our digital properties to create  consideration and when customers  show a high purchase intent, provide  them with frictionless customer  journeys to conclude a sale.
Our goal  is to address customer requirements  with the right product, at the right  time, and through their preferred  communication channel.
By executing this strategy, we aim  to improve our direct contribution to  business generation.
Evidence of our  success can be seen in the growth of  customer visits to our website/digital  properties and completion of product  purchase journeys.
To implement  our strategy effectively, we utilise an  omni-channel approach, leveraging  our digital properties (website, Net and  MobileBanking), notifications, SMS,  email, WhatsApp, and paid media  including social media.
Our communication is based on  advanced AI/ML models to ensure  segmentation and personalisation.
Additionally, we invest in advanced  analytics and data science using  cloud-based tools to gain a deep  understanding of customer behaviour,  curate personalised interventions,  and execute digital marketing plans  at scale.
We have revamped our  digital journeys for loans, deposits,  and payment solutions, enabling  customers to purchase products in  a frictionless manner.
Our advanced  analytics engine, 'Spark Beyond,'  allows us to test hypotheses, build  models, and understand customer  needs for meaningful interactions  and relationship building.
To drive  end-to-end outcome of unassisted  business generation, we work in cross- functional teams called PODs.
These  PODs comprising the marketing,  business and product teams drive  completion of purchase journeys  leveraging data-backed analyses to  solve business problems.
Finally, we  actively stimulate customer advocacy  by addressing grievances, managing  online reputation, and utilising ratings,  reviews, and testimonials to earn  customer trust and create brand  advocates.
Our Robust IT and Risk management  structure enables secured handling  of client information which is of  paramount importance to us.

Central  banks are likely to keep monetary  conditions tight through the year as  underlying price pressures remain  sticky and labour markets are tight  in several advanced economies.
The  recent turmoil in the US regional  banking sector and slower than  expected economic recovery in China  are other risks to the global economic  outlook.
After removing COVID-19  related restrictions, China’s economy  bounced back with 4.5% y-o-y GDP  growth in Q1 2023.
However, recent  high frequency data suggests that the  recovery momentum in China might be  slowing.
In 2023, slowdown in developed  economies is likely to be the major  drag on global growth.
The World  Bank estimates global GDP growth at  2.1% in 2023 vs. 3.1% in 2022.
Growth  in advanced economies is expected  to slow to 0.7% in 2023 from 2.6% in  2022, while growth in emerging market  and developing economies is expected  to be marginally better as compared to  2022 (4.0% in 2023 vs. 3.7% in 2022).

This process includes steps  to evaluate vendor supplied patches to  determine servers that require patches  and updates to document procedures  for patching and updating servers,  and to deploy patches and updates in  a timely manner to protect the Bank’s  infrastructure.
Penetration testing To test potentially exploitable  vulnerabilities, penetration tests are  conducted for all critical networks  and systems within the Bank’s  internal environment and for external  applications.
Penetration tests are  triggered based on several events,  including new releases, updates,  or enhancements.
The types of  penetration tests that are conducted  include Network/Host Penetration  Testing and Application Penetration  Testing.
Logging and monitoring The Bank has a logging and monitoring  procedure in place to deal with  network intrusions and incidents.
User  actions, system activity and changes  to the infrastructure are logged.
Logs  are stored securely and are protected  against modification, deletion, and  inappropriate access.
The relative  risk level of the asset and alerts are  generated in the event of audit log  failures.
Monitoring tools aggregate  the log files and suspicious activity  events are automatically reported to  the Security Operations Centre (SOC)  team.
The SOC team performs the  following steps: • Analysis and Incident Detection –  The SOC team collects information  from the system generated event as  well as other information sources to  identify a potential incident.
• Event Tracking and Escalation –  Events are assessed based on the  level of risk and escalated based  on guidance from the Incident  Management policy; escalations  include referral to the Cyber Incident  Response Team (CIRT) for in- depth analysis and forensics and  management for situation awareness.
• Reporting – The CSOC team  periodically reports on events and  incidents to management.
Minimised surface area for cyber- attacks The Bank has a dedicated program  for attack surface management that  includes continuous attack surface  discovery and hunting for weaknesses  on the discovered assets.
There has  been a continuous effort to ensure  that all significant weaknesses are  remediated within a reasonable  timeframe.
We have made significant  advancements to further consolidate  cyber security through initiatives  such as the foundation of a next-gen  Security Operations Center (SOC)  for predictive security and incident  management, introduction of Security  Orchestration, Automation & Response  (SOAR) to reduce incident response  times, network micro-segmentation  for better control, visibility and  preparedness against ransomware,  and round-the-clock defacement  monitoring and vulnerability  management of our internet properties.
The Bank has upgraded its monitoring  and detection systems by deploying  next generation security incident event  management (SIEM) solution fuelled by  artificial intelligence (AI) and machine  learning (ML) capabilities along with  strong UEBA (User Entity Behavioural  Analysis) functionalities and inbuilt  threat modelling.
This initiative and  approach to leverage AI and ML as an  entire suite to proactively detect and  respond to threats is an industry first.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 67 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Changing regulations, customer  preferences, and their material  impact on financial performance  are driving incorporation of  ESG as a key factor in decision- making for organisations and  investors alike.
The Banking  sector, being the custodian of the  world's economies, will play a  central role in ESG development  and holds the key to systemic  transformation required to achieve  net-zero emissions.
Already,  lending decisions at Banks are  becoming responsive to the ESG  criteria.
Additionally, Banks are  incorporating ESG considerations  into their risk management  practices, including climate  scenario analysis and climate- related stress testing.
Financial  products with ESG element, such  as green bonds, social bonds, etc.
are being curated to satisfy the  increasing demand for sustainable  investment options.
ESG Strategy Encompassing Sustainable Finance Driving positive impact  As per a recent report by the World  Bank, green bonds have raised USD  2.5 trillion globally until January 2023.
During the same month, India launched  the first green bond to raise about USD  2 billion for projects that contribute to  climate change mitigation, adaptation,  environmental protection, resource and  biodiversity conservation, and net- zero objectives.
As per a study by the  International Energy Agency, as quoted  in the Reserve Bank of India’s Report  on Currency and Finance, 2022-2023,  to reach net-zero emissions by 2070,  India would need USD 160 billion  per year on average between now  and 2030.
The evident financing gap  presents a compelling case for India’s  financial sector to gear up its efforts  in mobilising substantial funds and  implementing sustainable financing  solutions to support the country's  ambitious decarbonisation goals.
While the RBI had been taking  incremental actions towards aligning  Banks and their lending decisions  towards sustainable development for  over a decade, it has demonstrated  a distinct focus on climate-related  issues in the past year.
In July  2022, the RBI released its seminal  “Discussion Paper on Climate Risk  and Sustainable Finance” providing  broad guidance.
In January 2023, the  RBI issued sovereign green bonds to  mobilise resources for the Government  for green infrastructural investments.
In April 2023, the framework for  mobilising green deposits by regulated  entities has been released by the RBI  with a view to fostering and developing  green finance ecosystem in the  country.
In May 2023, its ‘Report on  Currency and Finance’ uncovered  the possible implications of climate  change for the Indian economy and  in preparing for the future – including  climate stress tests to assess the  banking sector’s vulnerability to climate  risks.
It is also expected to introduce  a disclosure framework on climate- related financial risks, along with  guidance on climate scenario analysis  and stress testing in the near future.
The Securities and Exchange Board  of India (SEBI) is also accelerating  for the ESG transition in India.
Moving forward from mandating ESG  disclosures on quantifiable metrics  for the nine principles of National  Guidelines on Responsible Business  Conduct for top 1000 companies in  India FY23 onwards, it has now also  announced mandatory assurance of  select ESG disclosures for the top  150 companies starting in FY24 which  shall be gradually extended to the top  1000 listed entities by FY27.
It has also  provisioned for ESG ratings based on  these assured disclosures.
The evolving landscape 68 Our ESG strategy The evolving landscape of ESG  integration in the Banking sector  therefore necessitates a holistic  approach that encompasses ESG  aligned decision-making not only for  our internal operational practices,  but also extending beyond onto  our external financing activities.
In  context of the latter, we are building  our systems to navigate challenges  and anticipate disruptions that may  manifest through this evolution in the  coming decade.
This makes it crucial  for us to embrace transformation in  operations and innovation in product  development to drive the transition  towards a more resilient, socially  responsible and environmentally  conscious economy.
The demand  for new solutions that catalyse and  accelerate the transition to a new  economy presents an opportunity for  us to play a role that is more impactful,  and direct than ever before.
The  trinity of innovation, technology and  partnerships offers a tremendous  opportunity for us to create new  markets, products, and business  models that would help build financial  strength.
We are developing a comprehensive  framework to support the integration  of new ESG policies – including  thorough evaluation of environmental,  social and governance risks as a part  of our overall credit appraisal and  approval process, setting specific  goals and targets for supporting  sustainable financing initiatives,  aligning with evolving ESG regulations  and guidelines.
Separately, we are also  firming up an internal strategy around  conducting climate risk assessments  and tracking our financed emissions.
We are also engaging with our  corporate borrowers to understand  their current ESG strategy and long- term climate transition plans, with  a view to tailor our corporate loan  portfolio towards climate-sensitive  financing.
In terms of managing our internal  operational practices, capturing ESG  performance data remains one of our  highest priorities and yet, a formidable  challenge.
The challenge is integral to  distributed nature of our operations  and is further convoluted with the  volume of data and the variance in  formats of data monitoring across  our operations.
We are continuously  working towards bringing the relevant  stakeholders together to communicate  ESG requirements and revise existing  data collection processes - where  required to progressively enhance  the completeness and accuracy  of data.
Our unrelenting efforts in  this direction have enabled us to  continuously further our transparency  and disclosure practices.
We continue  to align our report with multiple  frameworks - such as the GRI, IR,  and SASB, and get the key ESG  performance matrix externally assured.
This year, we have progressed  further and are disclosing the full  suite of applicable BRSR disclosure  requirements.
We are also exploring  data availability and methodologies for  reporting on Task Force for Climate  Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  and Task Force on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
Two years ago, we strategically  pledged to become carbon neutral by  FY32.
Over these two years, we have  worked extensively to formulate and  implement a framework that will keep  us on the path towards this goal, while  we continue to expand our operations.
We continue to invest in a broad  range of technological solutions and  operational measures to reduce energy  consumption at our operating locations  including renewable energy and energy  efficiency projects to lower our carbon  footprint.
Our pursuit of digitalisation,  IT, IoT on one hand and ESG on the  other hand has highlighted several  areas of simultaneous progress;  and we shall continue to leverage  such opportunities by investing in IT  capabilities and IT-enabled solutions.
Upgradation of our data architecture  will continue to complement evolution  of our data governance practices and  data collection strategy.
Underpinning all our ESG efforts is  our resolve to manage expectations  and respond to concerns of our  stakeholders.
Our people practices  are based on principles of respect  for human rights, employee well- being, inclusivity, fairness, and  continuous improvement.
For our  customers, we strive to build long- term relationships based on trust,  proving seamless service management  journeys, offering a responsible suite  of financial products and services,  and safeguarding the confidentiality  and protection of their information.
Our curated community development  initiatives aim to foster resilience,  contribute to nation-building, and  empower local communities through  collaborative partnerships and targeted  programs.
By enforcing responsible  vendor management practices,  we ensure the sustainability values  resonate with our suppliers and  partners.
HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 69 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements ESG Strategy encompassing Sustainable Finance Sustainable finance Sustainable finance is an organic  continuum of our ESG strategy.
The  ESG strategy has set the foundation  for the Bank to channel its resources  towards sustainable projects.
With  ESG gaining momentum as a key  factor in business decision making, the  Bank is leveraging sustainable finance  as one of its key ESG strategies in  the form of enhanced environmental  and social due diligence in lending  and investment decisions thematic  investing, ESG engagement and  sustainable finance frameworks.
Directing capital towards sustainable  projects allows us to integrate ESG as  the fundamental determinant in our  core lending strategy, and generate a  positive impact through our business  model.
Being one of the key players in the  banking industry, we recognize our  role in facilitating the transition to a  low-carbon economy.
With our pan- India presence and strong customer  relationships, we aim to drive positive  change by promoting environmentally  friendly technologies and financing  sustainable infrastructure projects.
We actively support the financing  and investment in environmentally- friendly technologies and low-carbon  infrastructure projects, leveraging  our product offerings and financial  expertise to assist our customers and  clients in transitioning to a sustainable,  low-carbon economy.
The Bank has identified its products  as one of the foremost business  focus areas wherein ESG risks, and  opportunities will be considered  for improvement in systems and  processes taking into account the  expectations from various stakeholders  including investors and regulators.
The Bank is pursuing this through  three thematic areas including ESG  integration in products, sustainable  finance and portfolio emissions.
As the  next step, long-term targets to strive to  contribute to a more sustainable future  are being set.
ESG integration in products We have adopted a four-dimensional  approach for steadily incorporating  ESG factors into the design,  development, and management of our  products.
ESG & Climate Change  Assessment framework:  In FY23, the Bank adopted an  enhanced and more comprehensive  Our approach Our ESG strategy encompasses  people, customers, lending, and  governance for long-term value  creation for all stakeholders.
Effective corporate governance  acts as a binding force that  integrates and supports our  organisational ESG efforts by  providing formalised processes,  and structures that guide our  decision-making and accountability  to ensure successful integration  of both internal and external ESG  initiatives within the organisation.
Our ESG initiatives are overseen  by the CSR & ESG Committee  of the Board.
A separate ESG  apex council at the management  level, chaired by the Group Head for  ESG & CSR and comprising senior  members from various functions,  reports to the CSR & ESG Committee  and provides regular updates to  the Board for annual review.
This  Committee is further supported by  ESG Working Groups including the  Environment Working Group which  oversees the environmental impact  from our operations; the Social and  Governance Working Group which  works on workplace policies and  governance initiatives; and the Product  Responsibility Working Group which  looks at ESG risks (including climate  risks) in the existing portfolio and ESG- linked opportunities.
We are in the process of setting out  specific and measurable targets  aligned with our business operations  and portfolio to track and evaluate  our progress, and report on the same  to the CSR and ESG Committee  of the Board through thorough  consultation with ESG Council and  Working Groups.
We also intend to  accelerate the scale and pace of  delivering value by using collaboration  as a mechanism to effectively foster  strategic partnerships with solution  providers, civil societies, government  agencies that would help us bring  together capabilities and resources to  achieve our ESG objectives.
KEY TENETS OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE Management   of portfolio   emissions Sustainable  Finance  Framework ESG Integration   in Products 70 COVERAGE OF OUR ESG & CLIMATE CHANGE   ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE “ESG & Climate Change Assessment”  framework, as a part of the overall  credit assessment for its wholesale  corporate borrowers.
The framework  has replaced the erstwhile “SEMS  Framework” and is applicable for  all borrowers where the Bank’s  direct funded and non-funded credit  exposure to the borrower exceeds  C100 Crore.
As per the framework, a detailed  template that captures the various  aspects of ESG compliance and  climate change risks/mitigants in  relation to the borrower, and their  business operations as a whole,  is a mandatory part of the credit  assessment and is included in the  Credit Appetite Memorandum (CAM)  for wholesale borrowers.
The template  assesses the various ESG & Climate  Change Risks associated with the  borrower’s operations and mitigation  measures/controls for the same.

As  a pre-disbursement compliance,  implementation of the necessary  mitigation measures is required and  are also monitored on an ongoing  basis during the implementation  phase of the project and corrective  action is taken in case of any adverse  developments.
Client engagement  As the largest private sector Indian  Bank, our role is to create awareness  amongst our borrowers, thereby  encouraging them to measure and  disclose their footprint.
This would  eventually reflect in our Scope 3  emissions and help us move towards  a net-zero portfolio commitment.
We understand that there are  opportunities in transitioning to a net- zero economy, but the ecosystem (in  the country) needs to be developed  to take up such opportunities.
The  Bank has been engaging with its large  corporate customers specifically those  with businesses in “hard to abate”  industries such as Oil & Gas, cement,  steel, power, auto, and mining.
The  purpose of these engagements is to  identify current ESG & Climate change  related focus areas/practices and to  identify best practices and emerging  initiatives being taken by industry  players on ESG and climate risk related  issues including, but not limited to: • Short term emission reduction  targets and long-term net-zero goals • Practices with respect to hazardous/ polluting waste management • ESG & climate related disclosures • Supply chain decarbonisation • Policies and practices with respect to  gender diversity/inclusion The Bank has been sharing such best  practices in wider client engagements  with other borrowers in the same  segments.
ESG compliance and the  impact of climate change has also  become one of the areas of discussion  in our regular customer calls/meetings  with the Customers.
The discussions  are expected to continue to take place  with different borrowers and best  practices/learnings from the same  would be documented.
Inclusion of terms & conditions  related to ESG compliance in  facility documentation As part of the Bank’s standard  facility documentation, an addendum  schedule has now been included  which comprises representations/ warranties/covenants agreed to, by  the borrower on various ESG related  issues.
This schedule is included in all  standard sanction letters Sustainable Finance  Framework It is our endeavour to enhance our  portfolio from a climate and ESG  perspective.
The Bank is in the  process of developing a “Sustainable  Financing Criteria” Framework (“the  Framework”) with the objective of  identifying facilities in its credit portfolio  where financing has been provided  to borrowers in identified industries,  qualifying as “sustainable lending”.
Credit facilities granted towards such  end uses in the specified industries  shall be classified as either “green”  or “social” facilities.
The Bank is  developing the Framework with the  objective of assessing and ultimately  enhancing its commitment towards  sustainable lending in various industry  segments.
The Framework is being developed  using Bond Principles (developed  by the International Capital Markets  Association - ICMA) and Loan  Principles (developed by the Loan  Market Association - LMA) as the basis  for identification of “sustainable finance  segments”.
Some of the key industry  segments which have been identified  thus far as “sustainable segments”  include: • Renewable energy – Solar and Wind  power generation • Hydroelectric power generation • Agriculture and Allied Businesses • Biomass and other non-conventional  energy sources • Sustainable/affordable Infrastructure • Impact NBFCs Renewable Energy Financing FY23 FY22 FY21 15,115 14,839 10,869 6,110 5,860 2,945 Cumulative Underwritten amount ( C Cr) Cumulative RE Capacity financed (MW) ESG Strategy encompassing Sustainable Finance 72 The Bank is in the process of obtaining  a third-party certification of the  methodology behind the framework  and the framework itself.
Once this is  in place, suitable disclosures would  be made in the public domain.
Our  plan to monitor our sustainable finance  portfolio will enable us to identify and  utilise climate transition value creation  opportunities.
Our financed renewable energy (solar  and wind) capacity has more than  doubled in the past 3 years, and we  anticipate financing to renewables as  well as other green projects to further  accelerate in the coming years.
So  far, we have underwritten loans of  C15,115 Crore for a cumulative capacity  of 6,110 MW.
Also, with increased  focus on energy transition projects we  sanctioned credit limits of C160 Crore  towards deployment of electric buses.
Managing our portfolio  emissions  As a progressive financial  service company, we embrace  our responsibility to incorporate  environmental considerations into our  investment decisions.
Through our  investments, we look forward to driving  the transition towards a sustainable,  low-carbon economy while mitigating  the risk of stranded investments.
This includes firming up a strategy to  integrate environmental risks, including  those stemming from climate change,  into our underwriting and portfolio  screening processes in the long term.
Our lending procedures are guided  by borrower and market demand, but  our credit exposure is well-diversified,  with no single industry having a high  concentration.
As a result, our credit  exposure to ecologically/socially  sensitive industry sectors has minimal  negative consequences.
Disclosure of our own portfolio  emissions remains dependent upon  emission data disclosures from our  borrowers.
Although, we acknowledge  the challenges involved, we remain  steadfast to working with our  borrowers to build their capacity for  the same.
Simultaneously, despite the  foreseeable challenges, we also intend  to use our influence to encourage our  borrowers to commit to net-zero.
Less than 1% of the total  exposure comes from fossil  fuels (coal and lignite) and their  extraction/mining.
The Bank has successfully  underwritten project term loan facility  amounting to C2,143 Crore for financing  development of City Gas Distribution  (CGD) network being implemented  by Torrent Gas Jaipur Private Limited.
Jaipur CGD network consists of 132  CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)  stations, 5.28 Lakh household PNG  (Piped Natural Gas) connections  and 8,423 inch-km of natural gas  pipelines.
CGD financing aids the  energy transitions towards greener fuel  reducing the country’s oil dependence  and supports Governments’ initiatives  to make the country a Gas economy.
The Bank is the advisor for  Mahanagar Gas Limited for  acquisition of Unison Enviro  Private Limited a (subsidiary of  Ashoka Buildcon Limited), which is  developing CGD network in three  geographical areas.
Also, the Bank  is the lead arranger for raising funds  from public through IPO listing for  IRM Energy Private Limited.
In alternative fuel space, the Bank  is evaluating multiple proposals  for financing projects involved in  production of Compressed Biogas  (CBG) projects and Ethanol which  reduces the carbon emissions  substituting the conventional fuels  like oil & gas.

Environment Institutionalising  Environmental Sustainability  Through a combination of time-bound,  progressive, and concrete measures,  we are actively reducing our most  material environmental impacts.
This  year, we are excited to introduce  new environmental Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs) in our reporting,  aligning with evolving reporting and  disclosure standards.
Governance We are committed to implementing  environmentally responsible practices,  in alignment with the direction set  forth by our Board of Directors.
The  Environment Working Group as  part of the three different working  groups within the ambit of ESG Apex  Council sets targets and identifies  opportunities for improvement in areas  of emissions, energy, water, and waste,  and reports to the Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) and Environment,  Social and Governance (ESG) of  the Board on our environmental  performance.
Metrics and Targets Informed by regulatory developments  and our stakeholders’ expectations,  we continue to identify material  key performance indicators (KPIs)  for reporting our environmental  performance.
We maintain a vigilant  monitoring system for the identified  KPIs and for the outcomes of new  initiatives across all our operations.
These KPIs encompass metrics related  to energy consumption, greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions, water usage,  and waste management.
The valuable insights drawn from the  monitored data are used for decision- making and target-setting and drives  our sustainability journey.
We are  steadily allocating the necessary  resources, including infrastructure,  personnel, technology, and finances,  to facilitate the monitoring, recording,  and reporting of new data points, as  well as to enhance the accuracy of  data collection.
Key tenets of our   environmental response Innovation Data Governance Practices Partnerships                                Technology 74 Our Energy Performance Being in the service sector, energy  is one of the main resources that we  consume to run our operations.
We  use electricity to power our operating  locations - including our data centres  and fossil fuel in the form of diesel,  petrol and CNG to power diesel-based  generators and company-owned cars.
In FY23, we consumed 1.98 Million GJ  of energy - which is a slight increase  on account of the increased number  of operating locations over last year.
Electrical energy accounts for over  79% of our energy consumption.
Most  of our energy consumption is in the  form of electricity (1.57 Million GJ),  and most of it is procured from the  grid although we continue to look out  for sources of renewable energy to  replace grid energy, wherever feasible.
Our focus is on aligning our  business operations with socially  and environmentally responsible  practices.
This involves integrating  technological advancements and  process improvements into our  daily operations to contribute  to the overall improvement of  the environmental quality and  creating value.
In FY23, our energy intensity stood  at 11.40 GJ/FTE and 10.24 GJ/INR  Crore income.
Compared to FY22,  our energy intensity increased slightly  in the reporting year, on account of  full-scale office-based operations in  FY23 as compared to a significant  proportion of our workforce working  from home during FY22 due to  COVID-19 induced restrictions.
In our efforts to gradually reduce our  carbon footprint, we are progressively  integrating renewable energy sources  into our overall power consumption.
We will install solar panels in our  upcoming offices wherever possible.
We have rooftop solar plants at 10  locations across the country.
Our total  capacity as of March 31, 2023 was  282.5 kWp.
In the state of Maharashtra, 12 of our  offices and branches have transitioned  to green power sourced at a premium  tariff through DISCOMs.
With the  procurement of over 2,533.8 MWh  during FY23, about 1,799 metric  tonnes of carbon emissions were  avoided during the year.
We are also currently exploring open  access for large office premises.
Despite a growing market for open- access procurement of renewable  energy, and the introduction of  progressive rules like "Promoting  Renewable Energy through Green  Energy Open Access Rules, 2022,  there remain a number of regulatory  and market challenges for us to scale  up our RE procurement.
Several states  are yet to adopt the Rules in the form  of Regulations for implementation of  Green Energy Open Access (GEOA)  at the state level, hindering the pace  of adoption of open access RE  across our locations.
We consider  it crucial to eliminate these external  challenges to enable at-scale adoption  of green power across our distributed  consumption centres.

This objective  is achieved through a multifaceted  approach, including the regulation  of existing equipment, installation  of energy-efficient alternatives, and  the implementation of automated  energy management solutions.
Our  comprehensive energy management  and efficiency strategy encompasses  various initiatives, reflecting our  commitment to sustainable practices  and mitigating climate change.
By leveraging digital systems and  data analytics, we gain valuable  insights into energy consumption  patterns.
Our focus extends to  maintaining branches at optimal  temperatures, improving power  efficiency, and automating  energy-consuming assets.
These initiatives enable us to  optimize energy usage, enhance  operational efficiency, and reduce  our environmental footprint.
In FY23, the Bank accounted for  electricity consumption from four of its  co-located data centers in addition to  an owned data center that was closed  during the reporting year.
We are also  implementing measures to increase  the energy efficiency of our data  centres which also leads to operational  efficiency enhancement.
Environment 76 We have incorporated several changes  within our infrastructure to improve  energy efficiency through auto controls  and environment-friendly equipment  and have installed centrally controlled  energy management system in about  600 branches across India till date.
This system has allowed us to control  consumption patterns, resulting in  savings to the tune of 17% annually on  an average.
We are using technology and  innovation as facilitators in our journey  towards low-carbon growth.
We have  implemented elevator and equipment  scheduling to reduce our energy  consumption.
We have also installed  occupancy sensors, capacitor banks  as well as Building Management  Systems at several of our operating  locations.
The energy management  modules with auto controls deployed  across select branches have resulted  in significant energy savings.
We also  have piloted use of modular UPS  in our branches and plan to scale  further.
Additionally, all ACs in our new  premises will conform to the latest BEE  standards.

We intend to adopt a more  holistic approach towards reducing  our environmental footprint at our  operating locations.
We have registered 1,990 projects  (offices & branches) with Indian  Green Building Council (IGBC) for  certification.
Of these, 947 projects  in different cities are certified under  the Green Interiors Rating System of  IGBC as of March 31, 2023.
All our  upcoming branches will be evaluated  for green certification.
Additionally,  some of our offices are also LEED  certified.
IGBC's comprehensive rating  modules encompassing Eco Design  Approach, Interior Materials, Water  Conservation, Indoor Environment,  Energy Efficiency, and Innovation in  Interior Design have been diligently  implemented and met with excellence  throughout our certified branches and  offices.
We prioritise environmental  sustainability and have been using  GreenPro certified materials such  as plywood, laminates, flooring tiles,  ceiling tiles, paints, adhesives, finishes,  and equipment at our select locations.
Additionally, we include low VOC  finishes in our BOQ and contractor  tendering process.
GHG emissions We are dedicated to playing our part  in addressing climate change and  promoting sustainable practices  not only within our operations but  also throughout our value chain.
Our emissions inventory includes  emissions from our operations in India  and includes our Corporate offices  (301), Currency Chests (33), Training  Centres & Guest Houses (26), Data  Centres (5*), Branches (7,813, which  excludes 4 overseas branches and  DBUs) and ATMs (17,765 - Excluding  CDMs), aligning to our reporting to  regulatory authorities as of March  31, 2023.
Collecting complete and  accurate activity data from tens of  thousands of our distributed locations,  of varying sizes & nature, is one of our  key challenges, and hence a strategic  priority action area.
The dynamic  nature of our branch operations,  characterized by the simultaneous  opening and closing of multiple  branches during the annual reporting  cycles further exacerbates the  complexities in accurately determining  and monitoring activity levels at  our locations during the different  timeframes across the reporting  year.
We are continuously enhancing  our data collection processes and  exploring suitable technological  solutions to enhance stakeholder  confidence on completeness of our  inventory.
We are continuously implementing  technical and management solutions  to reduce our GHG footprint.
Our  efforts in this direction are guided by  our commitment to become carbon  neutral by FY32.
We have rolled out an  actionable strategy roadmap designed  through an extensive bottom- up consultative process to make  incremental and measurable progress  towards this goal.
In FY23, our Scope 1 emissions  accounted for 8%, Scope 2# emissions  accounted for 80%, and Scope 3  emissions accounted for 12% of our  total emissions.
Out of the total   Scope 1 emissions, fuel consumption  in diesel generators was the primary  contributor with a share of 55%,  followed by fuel consumption in  company-owned vehicles contributing  to the remaining 45%.
Our Scope 2 emissions encompassed  emissions associated with purchased  electricity from the grid at locations  which are owned or controlled by the  Bank and are owned and co-located  data centres.
We are continuously  taking measures to seek ways to  reduce our scope 2 emissions -  through interventions in our own  operations and through collaboration  with our data centre service providers.
This year we have used both location  based and market based approach to  calculate our Scope 2 emissions.
Electricity consumption at our other  facilities, along with emissions on  account of air travel, car/cab travel,  train travel, paper, and e-waste  contribute to our Scope 3 emissions  that cover categories 5 and 6 and  8 as per the Technical Guidance for  Calculating Scope 3 Emissions of the  WRI GHG protocol.
At present, the  Bank only reports for category 5, 6  and 8 for scope 3 emissions.

78 Our Scope 1 emissions increased  from 20,876.97 tCO2e in FY22 to  29,828.77 tCO2e in FY23.
This  rise can primarily be attributed to  increased employee activity in the  reporting year leading to increased  travel and fuel consumption etc.

We  are continuously enhancing our data  collection systems, processes, and  governance mechanisms to improve  accuracy of data collection for GHG  inventorisation.
Considering Scope 2#  emissions are our primary source of  GHG emissions, we have prioritised  strengthening the mechanisms  for collection of our electricity  consumption data from various  operating locations.
In the first phase,  we are targeting our high consumption  locations, gradually moving on to other  location categories.
Overall, during FY23, actual kWh  data could be obtained for 52% of  the locations which accounted for  about 54% of the total electrical  energy consumed.
For the remaining  locations, a hierarchical approach has  been followed for estimating energy  consumption.
For locations with  available electricity procurement costs,  the same has been used along with  state-level tariff to estimate electricity  consumption.
For other locations,   electricity consumption was calculated  using internally derived electricity  consumption benchmarks specific to  climatic zones.
We have identified ATMs as one of the  location categories where we need to  significantly set up our efforts to collect  actual energy consumption despite  ATMs accounting for approximately 4%  of the total energy consumption.
In FY23, our Scope 3 emissions  increased over FY22.
The emissions  from purchased electricity at other  facilities accounted for 67% of our total  Scope 3 emissions.
In comparison to  FY22, the emissions from our other  facilities have decreased by 3%.
Apart  from these facilities, hired cabs (14%),  air travel (12%), paper waste (7%), rail  travel (0.005%) and e-waste (0.005%)  contributed to our Scope 3 emissions.

1.
For most of our locations (over 90%), the  diesel consumption in DG sets is recorded  in our financial database as the amount  spent for diesel purchased and is converted  into the quantity of diesel fuel consumed  using estimations of diesel prices in different  states.
For the remaining 10% of locations,  we have extrapolated based on estimates  of diesel consumption at other locations  serving as our internal benchmarks for  diesel consumption.
2.
The data for expenditure towards purchase  of fossil fuels for consumption in company- owned vehicles is extracted from the Bank's  financial management system and is used  to derive fuel consumption in liters/kg using  estimates of fossil fuel prices in various  states.
For remaining locations, the national  average fuel price is used and average of  CNG price in NCT is used to estimate CNG  consumption.
3.
At present, the refrigerants data is not  included in the Scope 1 emissions as  the bank is in the process of collating the  refrigerant data.
The Bank has considered both location-based  and market-based approach to calculate its  Scope 2 emissions.
Scope 2 emissions include  GHG emissions from electricity consumed in  the facilities that can be considered to be under  the operational control of the Bank, as well  as its co-located data centres.
A hierarchical  approach has been followed for the estimation  of emissions from this category (i.e.
(i) monitored  data on electricity consumption, (ii) estimated  electricity consumption based on location  specific trends of electricity consumption for  over six months, (iii) estimates of electricity  consumed based on procurement costs and  state-level tariff; and (iv) estimated electricity  consumption based on climatic-zone specific,  internally derived electricity consumption  benchmarks; in that order).
For location based  approach, in all cases, the Grid emission factor  from version 18 of the CEA’s (Central Electrical  Authority) CO2 database has been used.
While  for market based approach, emission factor of  0 has been considered against the electricity  consumed/ procured from captive rooftop solar  plants and green tariff Scope 3 emission estimation: Emission on  account of purchased electricity at our other  locations (i.e.
ATMs) has been estimated using  the same approach as in Scope 2.
Emissions  from hired cabs have been estimated based  on an e-expense report for hired cabs from  the Bank’s financial management system –  which has been used to derive the distance  travelled.
The average emission factor for  various categories of cars from the India GHG  Programme has been used.
For domestic air,  international air and rail travel, information on  trip characteristics has been extracted from  the Bank’s financial management system, and  the distance travelled is derived from publicly  available sources.
The emission factors for  domestic air travel have been taken from  the India GHG programme.
Whereas, the  international air travel emission calculation has  been done as per DEFRA Government emission  conversion factors for greenhouse gas company  reporting, Business travel-air (2022).
Emissions from paper waste and e-waste have  been estimated based on emission factors for  landfilling provided by the latest version of the  USEPA’s WARM tool on the extracted data for  paper waste and e-waste disposed.
During FY23, our Scope 1+2 GHG  emissions intensity decreased by 11%  and 11% y-o-y per FTE and per Crore  income, respectively.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 81 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Measures to reduce GHG emissions We remain committed to implementing meaningful and system-driven changes within the organisation to reduce  the GHG intensity of our operations.
We have adopted firm-level guidelines for operations and procurement for  supply-side and demand-side interventions.
Environment With our unwavering commitment towards environmental  sustainability, we have set forth an ambitious target of  achieving carbon neutrality by 2032.
In our FY22 Integrated  Report, we had also given out our trajectory for carbon  neutrality with interim targets on energy and emissions KPIs.
While our overarching target of achieving neutrality by FY32  remains unchanged, we have re-aligned the interim targets  based on increase in overall emission projections resulting  from the addition of offices and branches from HDFC  Limited, post the merger.
We have mapped our performance  against our target for FY23 in the figure below: FY23 FY24 FY26 FY27 FY28 FY29 FY30 FY31FY  22# FY  25* FY  32** 0.000.000.150.250.270.290.290.300.33 0.310.31 0.31 0.34 Scope 1+2 Emissions    (in Million tCO 2e)   Actual Emissions     Emission Projection With our ever-expanding footprint, we acknowledge the  challenges on our path to carbon neutrality.
We believe  that actions taken now will set the pace for accelerated  emission reduction in the long run, even though their impact  may not be immediately visible.
During the reporting year,  we kickstarted the implementation of our carbon-neutral  strategy with actions across our demand side and supply  side.
Many of these measures were implemented in the later  quarters of the reporting year.
We are confident that these  measures will manifest as substantial emission reductions in  FY24 and beyond.

While we diligently address  emissions within our operating boundary, we also acknowledge the importance of taking measures outside our direct  operations.
We have thus, prioritised two key aspects that have a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions within our value  chain: paper waste reduction and tree plantation.
Waste Management We aim to work progressively towards  sustainable management of waste  generated from our operations.
We  are in the process of formalising  a waste management policy that  prioritises segregation and recycling,  promotes environmental awareness  and ensures safe handling and storage  of waste.
We assign clear roles and  responsibilities, comply with legislative  requirements, and aim to minimise  waste generation.
While we have been continuously  striving to reduce waste generation  from our facilities, during the reporting  year, we have taken a significant step  forward by implementing an effective  recycling program for several waste  categories across several of our  locations.
This expansion reinforces  our commitment to promoting the  circular economy and minimizing our  negative environmental footprint.
7.01 tonnes     Plastic waste recycled in FY23 45,000+   tCO2e/per year    CO2 sequestration potential created  through our plantation activities so far 163.25 tonnes     Paper waste recycled in FY23 30 Lakh+     Trees planted up to FY23 Environment Reducing GHG  emissions across   our value chain Where paper use is unavoidable, we are  switching to recycled paper.
As a result,  associated emissions increased by less than  20% y-o-y in FY23, despite a 13% increase in  our customer base.
Our digital products and services, along  with automation of several internal as well as  customer-linked processes and channels,  have enabled us to reduce paper waste  generation.
The ‘Green Event Guidelines’  rolled out by our retail marketing team has  helped save about 33.10 Lakh Sq.
ft. of paper  during the reporting year.
Our digitised processes and products  have helped customers reduce their  frequency of visits to the Bank’s  branches, ATMs, and offices - thereby  reducing associated emissions.
We have launched an ambitious tree plantation  initiative and have successfully planted over 30  Lakh trees to date.
This program has not only  resulted in significant reductions in our GHG  emissions but has also served as a catalyst for  enhancing our social and relationship capital.
84 We deal with five types of non- hazardous wastes: e-waste, paper  waste, food waste, plastic waste,  and other non-hazardous waste.
We  recognise our responsibility in ensuring  that all these wastes are disposed  responsibly.
For dry waste, we have  implemented waste segregation and  recycling in 16 offices.
All the dry waste  from these offices is collected and  disposed through authorised vendors  who eventually recycle the waste.
In FY23, disposal of our owned IT  assets led to the generation of 87.82  tonnes of e-waste and batteries  in addition to 0.33 tonnes of other  e-waste and batteries from our non-IT  operations at select locations.
We  ensure that our e-waste and batteries  are disposed through authorised  recyclers.
88.15 tonnes     of e-waste generated and  recycled in FY23 293.89 tonnes     Total waste recycled in FY23 Through internal consultations and  partnerships with our vendors, we will  be expanding the coverage of facilities  at which we track our dry waste  (including e-waste) progressively and  scale it up over the next few years.
At  some of our locations, waste diesel oil  is produced due to the operation of DG  sets which is classified as hazardous  waste and disposed using approved,  authorised vendors.
Water Conservation Due to the value of water as a precious  resource, we use water judiciously.
Our water consumption is restricted to  consumption for domestic purposes  and drinking.
At our most locations, we  obtain water from municipal or third- party suppliers.
We are committed to  reducing water consumption and to  accurately measuring and monitoring  it.
As part of this commitment, we have  planned installation of IoT-based water  meters at some of our locations.
In the  coming years, we will be expanding  this coverage in a phased manner.
By incorporating water-saving  practices, and technologies, we are  S.No.

actively working towards a more  sustainable future and playing our part  in addressing global water challenges.
In our IGBC certified branches,  all washrooms are equipped with  low-flow flush & low-flow fixtures;  the urinals are sensor-based with a  flow rate of 1 to 1.5 Low-Pass Filter  (LPF).
Through such measures, most  of our green branches are able to  achieve 27-30% water savings over  the UPC(I) baselines.
Estimated water  consumption at an operational level  with respect to our total employee  strength for FY23 is about 2,167 Million  Litres.
We do not generate industrial  wastewater.
However, for the sewage  that is produced, we have taken  proactive steps by installing sewage  treatment plants at some of our larger  office premises.
Besides our operation, we also have  an impact outside our operational  boundaries by working with  communities to conserve water and to  rejuvenate water bodies.
The details  of this can be found in our ‘Social- Communities’ chapter.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 85 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements TCFD disclosures HDFC Bank recognises the growing  concerns of regulators, investors,  and clients about climate risks that  businesses, particularly banks and  financial institutions, face.
This is  our third year of working on the  recommendations of the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) - which provides a useful  framework for identifying climate- related risks and opportunities,  evaluating effective responses, and  communicating crucial information to  stakeholders.
Governance The Bank has a Board approved and  governed ESG policy framework and  Environmental Policy that identifies  the Bank's environmental risks  and impacts including those from  Climate Change.
The CSR & ESG  Environment 86 Committee of the Board oversees  the Bank’s sustainability and climate  change initiatives.
This committee  oversees and monitors the ESG  framework, the Environmental policy,  actionables and initiatives strategised  and executed by the management  level ESG Apex Council and the ESG  working groups.
The committee also  oversees and monitors the Bank’s ESG  disclosures, highlighting the Bank’s  ESG performance and prioritisation  of material topics.
The ESG Apex  Council is a senior management level  council that governs and reviews the  progress of the three ESG working  groups that drive the ESG agenda  (including climate change) at the Bank.
This committee shapes and guides the  ESG strategy of the Bank.
Updates on  actionable arising from this committee  are further reported to the CSR &  ESG committee of the Board.
The  ESG working groups reports to the  ESG Apex Council and is responsible  for driving the Bank’s ESG strategy  and roadmap to achieve set targets,  including those of climate change.
There are three working groups for  better focus and monitoring: the  Environment working group, the Social  & Governance working group and  the Product Responsibility working  group.
The Environment working  group sets targets and identifies  opportunities for improvement in  areas of emissions, energy, water, and  waste.
The Product Responsibility  group, examines Environmental &  Social (E&S) risks in our portfolio and  lending, including climate risks, while  finding new business opportunities in  the E&S arena.
It is also responsible  and accountable for formalisation  of sustainable finance framework  and processes to identify ESG risks  in lending, engagement with clients  on ESG including climate change  and the action taken on TCFD  recommendations including stress  testing.
Climate change initiatives are  updated to the CSR & ESG committee  of the Board that meets every quarter.
The Bank has a dedicated ESG vertical  that works in conjunction with several  internal and external stakeholders,  to drive the ESG agenda including  managing, mitigating, and reporting  on climate metrics.
The Group Head  (CSR & ESG) reports to the Board  every quarter, chairs the ESG apex  council which drives the ESG & climate  change strategy via the three working  groups.
The management level ESG  council and working groups and  hence the CSR & ESG committee of  the Board reviews plans of action,  targets, current performance against  targets, initiatives undertaken by  internal business units and employees  to mitigate effects of climate change  etc.
The Board Committee also helps  in setting and reviewing performance  objectives thereby prescribing annual  budgets for the same.
The Bank’s  risk team headed by the Chief Risk  Officer spearheads the assessment  and climate risk linked analysis of  the Bank's portfolio.
Credit officers  assess overall E&S risks, especially  climate risks through a comprehensive  “ESG & Climate Change Assessment”  framework, as a part of the overall  credit assessment for its wholesale  corporate borrowers.
Strategy The Bank has been reporting to the  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  on its climate change strategy,  risks, opportunities, and emissions.
From the perspective of climate risk  assessment, we will assess the priority  of physical and transition risks in the  near to medium term.
Some of the  critical parameters to consider would  be GHG emissions, air pollutants and  climate transition risk pathways both  at the sector and borrower level.
There  are two main types of climate related  risks: 1)  Physical risks (both acute and  chronic): Economic losses  (physical damage to property and  assets) from extreme weather  events (flood, cyclone, etc.)
attributed to climate change 2)  Transition risks: Possible process  of adjustment to a low carbon  economy and its effects on the  value of financial assets and  liabilities.
We are actively exploring frameworks  to model and assess climate risk.
For this purpose, we have partnered  with an independent global agency to  source models for assessing climate  transition risk.
Additionally, we are  committed to acquiring granular data  and utilising BRSR data to strengthen  our climate risk assessment tools and  conduct scenario analysis.
Given that  climate risk is an emerging and long- term risk for the Bank, we will consider  adopting a suitable methodology/ pathway to analyse the Bank’s  exposures under different climate  scenarios.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 87 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Current   regulation Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always  integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process.
Current regulations are also  factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the comprehensive ESG & Climate  Change assessment framework for its wholesale corporate borrowers.
Emerging  regulation Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy,  technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy.
This  is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like  coal, thermal and infrastructure.
We are actively exploring frameworks to model and assess climate  risk.
For this purpose, we have partnered with an independent global agency to source models  for assessing climate transition risk.
Additionally, we are committed to acquiring granular data and  utilizing BRSR data to strengthen our climate risk assessment tools and conduct scenario analysis.
Technology While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of our business  today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant  impact on climate risk.
Our low-carbon digital banking products use technology to enable business.
Legal For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental rules, failing  to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into litigation.
This, however, is not a claim against the Bank.
There are no other circumstances in which the Bank  can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit.
Market In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in shifting the demand and supply  for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in low-carbon digital products.
However, we do  recognise the relevance of change in consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this  risk, but do not have the tools at present to quantify/include this as part of our risk assessment  process.
Reputation Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary risk to our business.
We thus  invest in community and customer involvement through surveys and structured engagements to  educate and enlighten them on climate risks and mitigation.
Further, ESG performance measures  are increasingly being used by the global investor community, especially sovereign wealth funds and  pension funds, to assess long-term profitable growth.
We strive to implement environment-friendly  measures throughout our operations.
We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate  change, by including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report.
In addition, in  our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint (third-party  assured).
Acute physical Acute physical hazards can have a negative influence on our credit portfolio by causing bad debts  due to damage to property, infrastructure, and land.
This is also relevant for climate disasters  destroying assets (that serve as collaterals).
We continue to measure physical risks from a climate  risk assessment perspective and will assess the priority of these risks in the near-to-medium  term.
In addition, our Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams conduct business impact  analyses and have rapid response procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as  floods.
Chronic physical Chronic physical risks are far into the future.
Given that climate risk is an emerging and long-term  risk for us, we will consider adopting a suitable methodology/pathway to analyse our exposures  under different climate scenarios.
Risk Management Environment 88 Further details on our ESG strategy  and climate change that drive the  importance of a holistic approach  that encompasses ESG aligned  decision-making not only for our  internal operational practices, but also  extending beyond, onto our external  financing activities are available in  the chapter on ESG strategy and  sustainable finance.
The chapter  also highlights our focus areas in the  domain of sustainable finance including  transition finance, engagement with  borrowers to understand their best  practices, perspective to climate  change and net zero goals.
While  our lending procedures are guided  by borrower and market demands,  the bank's credit exposure is well  diversified across numerous industries,  with no single industry having a high  concentration.
As a result, the Bank's  credit exposure to ecologically/socially  sensitive industry sectors has minimal  negative consequences.
In addition,  as part of our credit policy, we do  not extend finance for setting up of  new units for producing/consuming  ozone-depleting substances (CFC  – 11, CFC – 12, CFC – 113, Carbon  Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform,  Halons – 1211, 1301, 2402) and for  small and medium scale units engaged  in the manufacture of aerosol units  using CFC.
Metrics and Targets We have taken on an ambitious  target for achieving carbon neutrality  of our scope 1 and 2 emissions by  FY32 and are already aligning our  operations to progressively stringent  internal benchmarks for enhancing our  energy performance and integration  of renewable energy.
If FY24, we will  be reviewing our performance against  the internal benchmarks and targets  and incorporating the best available  technologies and practices to realign  our integrated strategy, wherever  required.
Additionally, we aspire to fortify our  commitment to financing climate  change solutions such as energy  transition, renewables, energy  efficiency, sustainable transportation,  green buildings, climate smart  agriculture, among others, and have  already embarked on a process to  examine our financed emissions and  carbon-related asset exposure with  the intent to develop KPIs and set  goals to track the progress towards  assisting our customers and clients in  transitioning to a sustainable, low- carbon economy.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 89 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Our customers are the  key to our existence,   and customer focus  is one of the five core  values driving our  mission to be a world- class Indian Bank.
Customer Centricity Embedding customer focus  in everything we do  Service Quality  Initiatives and  Grievance Redressal The Bank has always endeavoured  to improve customer experience and  has adopted a holistic approach for  the same across multiple channels  ranging from Branch Banking,  PhoneBanking, NetBanking,  MobileBanking, WhatsAppBanking,  EVA chatbot and the Bank’s social  care handles.
The Bank has also  improvised on the relationship-based  banking programmes by introducing  a Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM)  programme to cater to various financial  needs in a personalised manner.
To  improve customer service, the Bank  has implemented a three-step strategy  – Define, Measure, and Improve.
The Bank has established robust  processes to regularly monitor and  evaluate service quality levels not  only at various touchpoints but  also at a product and process level  through the Quality Initiatives Group.
To continuously enhance the quality  of service, the Service Quality team  conducts regular reviews across  various products, processes, and  channels.
The Bank has also created a  unique Service Quality Index (SQI) for  its primary customer-facing channels,  which measures their performance on  critical customer service parameters  and helps improve the same.
The Bank prioritises customer service  satisfaction as reflected in our Board- approved Grievance Redressal Policy.
The Grievance Redressal Policy is  accessible to the public on our website  and in our branches.
The Bank receives customer  complaints largely in relation to Debit/ Credit Cards, Internet Banking,  account operations, loans and  advances amongst others (Refer  Annexure 7 to the Director’s Report).
The Bank's service quality team and  Grievance Redressal mechanism is  being further strengthened to prioritise  prompt resolution of complaints.
The  Bank is working towards providing  timely updates to customers and  MANAGING CUSTOMER   INTERACTIONS AND FEEDBACK Net Promoter  System (NPS) -  ‘Infinite Smiles’  Service Quality  Initatives Grievance  Redressal 90 Building a customer- centric culture using  Net Promoter System  (NPS) - ‘Infinite Smiles’  We, at the Bank, believe that delivering  an outstanding customer experience  is a strong differentiator for a great  product and is key to a sustained  competitive advantage.
The primary  aim of the Infinite Smiles programme is  to establish employee behaviour and  practices which leads to customer- centric actions and continuous  improvements.
Last year, we initiated measurement  on key journeys, identified action areas  to improve customer experience and  implemented several key initiatives.
This has led to a steady improvement  on our NPS over the year.
This year, we built on our commitment  to our customers by scaling the  coverage of our Infinite Smiles  programme – we introduced new  journeys, new episodes and new  products ensuring a much wider  coverage.
Customer focus has seen  increased focus - regular cadence  with key stakeholders and rigorous  follow-up on actions have become the  cornerstones of Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses  critical episodes – On-Boarding  journeys, customer instructions, ATM  transactions.
We now cover 140+  episodes and have contacted around  100 Million customers in FY23 for  their feedback.
Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ program rests on  three meticulously designed pillars  – ‘Listen’; ‘Learn’; and ‘Act’ which  enables us to embed customer- feedback led transformation as a  discipline into our systems, challenge  what is considered as the standard,  and offer a customer experience that  places us amongst the best service  brands.
ensuring their complaints are handled  by dedicated officers in accordance  with regulatory guidelines.
The Bank's Board-approved Protection  Policy limits customer liability in case  of unauthorised electronic banking  transactions.
In addition to customer  awareness sessions, your bank is also  working on implementing technology  specific risk based controls to curb the  menace of financial frauds.
The Bank invites and reviews  performance on customer service,  quality of service provided and  grievance redressal at different levels  including Branch Level Customer  Service Committees (BLCSCs),  Standing Committee on Customer  Service (SCCS) and Customer Service  Committee of the Board (CSCB).
The Bank has participated in  RBI’s Nationwide Intensive  Customer Awareness campaign  to enhance customer awareness  of their rights and responsibilities  in relation to customer service  standards, as well as the Internal  Grievance Redress (IGR) provided  by the Regulated Entities and  Alternate Grievance Redress  (AGR) mechanism of RBI.
The  Bank aims to reach the unreached  customers by spreading the  awareness to the farthest and  remotest areas of the country.
The initiative also aimed to raise  awareness among customers  about the self-protection  measures to safeguard against  the increasing incidents of digital  and electronic financial frauds.

We have now  embedded Smile Score and customer  feedback as an outside-in perspective  for measuring process efficiency.
Infinite Smiles program is a practical  framework to grow by enriching the  lives of our customers and employees.
It is the business equivalent of the  Golden Rule: Treat others as you  would want to be treated.
Guided by our aspiration to move  from score to systems, we have been  working to institutionalise the process  for addressing customer issues that  transcend beyond measurement and  create a culture of customer-centricity  and agility.
We would not only like to anticipate  and react to changing customer  expectations but also like to provide  a proposition to our customers  that makes us more attractive than  competitive alternatives.
With this in view we subscribed to  competitive benchmarking of NPS,  in the form of a subscription based  product NPS Prism®.

Despite  the evolving tactics of fraudsters,  we implemented multiple initiatives  to drive fraud awareness among our  employees and customers.
Realising that traditional financial safety  ads had lost their appeal, we seized  the opportunity to engage Indians  through their love for Bollywood and  social media influencers.
Introducing  our Secure Banking influencer,  "Vigil Aunty," became our strategy  to educate and protect Indians from  fraudsters in an entertaining manner.
We launched Vigil Aunty on the  75th Independence Day through  mass announcements in leading  newspapers.
To maximize reach,  we created thematic and contextual  educative videos featuring Vigil Aunty  on platforms like Facebook, Instagram,  and Josh, where influencer-generated  content thrives.
Through these channels, we kept  our customers informed about the  latest tactics employed by financial  fraudsters, empowering them to  detect cyber fraud attempts and stay  safe.
Additionally, we developed a  WhatsApp Chatbot (729 0030 000) to  provide real-time updates and insights  into the latest news and frauds.
In just 6 months, Vigil Aunty  garnered a staggering reach of  146 Mn+ and built a dedicated  fan base of over 2.3 Mn.
As  part of our commitment, we  conducted more than 5,900  training programmes, benefiting  over 62,500 customers, including  senior citizens, self-help groups,  and law enforcement agencies.
Going beyond awareness, we  proactively tracked online frauds  and vulnerabilities, with a primary  focus on protecting our HDFC Bank  customers.
Leveraging powerful tools,  we monitored fraudsters on Google  and social media channels.
Swiftly,  we identified and took down fake  customer care numbers, social media  profiles, Twitter handles, and career  pages falsely associated with HDFC  Bank.
Our response time for removing  such fraudulent entities was within   24-48 hours.
From September 2022 to March 2023,  we successfully dismantled over  82,692 fake profiles, 1,500 counterfeit  links, and 1,900 deceptive contacts,  effectively mitigating risks and  safeguarding our customers' interests.

This will be the  differentiating factor separating us from  rest of the banks when it comes to  competing with FinTechs and Bigtechs  by enabling rapid technology adoption.
Few processes for such technology  enablement implemented in the Bank  are as follows: 1)  ServiceNow: Our cloud-based  IT service modernisation platform  has completely transformed  employee ticket resolution  experience providing enhanced IT  operational efficiency and resilient  IT compliance posture.
2)   O365: Full suite of Office 365  apps made available allowing  employees to work from  anywhere and collaborate  seamlessly for boosted  efficiencies and productivity.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 103 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Social – People  Cultural transformation propelling  workplace transformation Our people are the soul  of the Bank.
Every HDFC  Banker represents the  Bank to its stakeholders.
Therefore, it is our  responsibility to ensure  that we fully equip  and enable them.
This  encompasses the  organisation’s culture,  our talent processes,  people practices and  employee experience.
Organisational Culture has a deep  impact on the employee experience  and engagement levels of our people.
The HDFC Bank culture framework is  enshrined in the ‘HDFC Bank Way.’   It provides direction and clarity in our  journey towards becoming a future- ready Bank.
Each pillar represents elements that the Bank stands for and believes in.
Reinforcement of the HDFC Bank Way continues to be a key focus area of the Bank.
The HDFC Bank Way The HDFC Bank Way comprises of six defined Culture pillars - Integrity Innovation Inclusion HumilityCollaboration Execution "Our  most important  priorities are going  to be in the way we  conduct ourselves from a  governance and compliance  perspective, how we can  enable a great working  environment for our staff  and how this can lead to  delightful customer service."
Sashidhar Jagdishan MD & CEO- HDFC Bank 104 Culture transformation is a long  term game; won over several short  term sprints.
Culture change in the  organization gains momentum with  small, quick wins.
However, sustained  commitment and effort is required for  it to become part of the organization's  fabric.
Towards this a Supervisory  Behavioral Architecture was  introduced: Nurture, Care, Collaborate  (NCC)' Over the last twenty-four months,  the intervention has covered 18,000  frontline managers who in turn manage  over 1,00,000 customer facing  employees.
As part of this year's  focus on this initiative, we specifically  covered Senior Leadership as they  are the 'Torchbearers of Culture' in the  Bank.
A separate intervention focused  on self-reflection and introspection  was designed for this group of leaders.
The program objective remained  the same, but the intervention’s  manifestation was more reflective and  contemplative in design.
The content  was contextualised to reflect the reality  of the leadership life stages and how  to address them.
The program had  nine key themes and, was designed  as a 3-months journey delivered  through versatile, immersive learning  methodology.
Intense socialising and reinforcing  the ‘Reason to believe’ is critical in  any transformation journey.
Keeping  this in mind we launched NCC  Dialogues where Senior Leaders  across the country connected with  the employees, especially young  managers, and shared stories on  how they embodied Nurture Care  and Collaborate in their professional  journey, challenges they encountered  and strategies they adopted to  overcome them.
We also initiated an engaging and  educative communication campaign  for all employees on ‘Living the  HDFC Bank Way’.
Using principles of  Transactional Analysis, we designed  a situation-based communication  campaign which explicitly differentiates  and articulates the “unacceptable vs  acceptable’ behaviour.
We have also incorporated NCC  parameters in our Organisation and  Manager scorecard.
So, the managers  have a perspective on how they are  experienced as a leader and what they  need to work on.

Recognized as India’s Best  Employer Among Nation Builders,  2023 (2 consecutive cycles) Social – People Diversity, Equity and  Inclusion Inclusion is a fundamental pillar of our  culture framework the ‘HDFC Bank  Way.'
It has been a central theme  of the Nurture, Care, Collaborate  intervention.
Our MD and Senior  Leadership team, during their extensive  travel across the country, actively  engage with officers at the grassroots  level and reinforce the importance of  inclusion among managers and our  frontline employees.
We continue to prioritise our focus  on two critical aspects of the DE&I  agenda:  • Gender diversity  • Persons with Disabilities (PwD) The governance structure established  to set the agenda and provide strategic  direction to DE&I initiatives continues  to be our guiding force in accelerating  momentum in this space.
The Council design consists of Senior  Business Leaders along with HR at the  Centre and in the Regions Women at workplace Gender diversity ratio for the Bank  improved from 22% to 24% over the  last 12 months.
When combined with  Sales Officers workforce, the overall  gender ratio gets moderated to 23% We have initiated several measures  with an intent to a) Increase the  diversity footprint in the Bank b) Enable  career growth and retention of women  c) Ensure gender equity and parity in  pay, promotions etc.
Our Pleasant Parenthood Program is  designed to offer a range of options  and support primary caregivers during  their important life stage transitions:  pre, during, and post maternity leave.
It includes flexibility in work timings  and location, sensitising managers,  performance rating protection,  providing access to health and  nutrition support, counselling services  etc.
To bolster the diversity ratio at mid  to senior levels, we have introduced  the ‘Career Accelerator Program’  (CAP) which is a holistic program  aimed at leadership development  of high potential women at the  mid management levels.
We have  successfully ensured career growth  opportunities for majority of the  women who were part of the maiden  program.
We have established several channels  of communication and connect  with women employees by HR and  business teams, deep dive focus  group discussions and employee  Pulse – Creating a Listening  Organisation In the process of continuously  enhancing our listening capability, we  have also launched PULSE, a real- time continuous listening tool that  allows us to capture micro-experiences  of employees on a real time basis.
Given our scale, geographical spread  and the pandemic realities, meeting  employees in person had become a  challenge.
This has also accelerated  the need to have a tool that will enable  us to tap into what’s working and what  can be improved on a regular basis.
This Virtual Pulse tool gives us the  opportunity to reach out to employees  as often as needed, gaining real-time  insights that can translate into quick  actions on the ground.
Great Place to Work   Re-Certification HDFC Bank was certified as a Great  Place to Work® Organisation for three  consecutive cycles.
This certification  is also a testimony to the Bank's  inherent strength as an Institution par  excellence and the efforts to support  and enable employees through  best-in-class people practices and  processes.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 109 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Social – People Leadership & Professional  Development (LPD) LPD is designed to ensure we remain  a world-class institution.
The LPD  landscape is defined to nurture future  leaders by enhancing their leadership  effectiveness and professional skills.
It is built to develop key leadership  capabilities at all levels, enabling  individuals to lead themselves,  their teams, their functions, and the  organisation as a whole.
In the fiscal year 2023, we  introduced two new programs to  further strengthen our Leadership  Development roadmap: 1)  Crucible: A program for mid- level managers aimed at building  leadership skills to effectively  translate strategy into action.
2)   Aspiring Leaders Programme:  Designed for senior individual  contributors to successfully  transition into people manager  roles 2,100   Sales Officers completed Career  Progresssion Programme 1,500+   Sales Officers moved into   Bank Roles.

Ignite, designed for  middle management levels, places  emphasis on collaborative and  strategic skills, fostering courageous  leadership in the participants.

110 Talent Management  the Digital Way  The Bank achieved a significant  milestone by successfully transitioning  the Talent Management Module to  a digital platform.
This milestone  has resulted in improved operational  efficiency and enhanced the  management of talent across the  organisation.
With a focus on wider  coverage and better control of the  talent management process, the Bank  now has access to comprehensive  employee data.
To support talent management efforts,  the Bank has established a structured  and well-documented Leadership  Competency Framework and Functional  Capability Framework.
These  frameworks serve as the cornerstone  for various talent processes, providing  clear guidelines for identifying and  developing key competencies.
Within the Bank, a robust bi-annual  Performance Management System  (PMS) is in place.
This system requires  every employee to conduct a self- assessment of their performance based  on their designated key result areas.
Subsequently, a joint performance  discussion takes place between the  appraiser and the appraisee, utilising  the self-evaluation as a foundation.
Additionally, the Bank recognises the  importance of succession planning as  a continuous process.
This proactive  approach aligns with other talent  management interventions and aims  to mitigate critical people risks, such  as vacancy fulfilment and transition  challenges.
Succession planning  involves providing employees with  relevant role exposures, specific  mentoring or coaching opportunities,  and addressing their identified learning  needs.
By doing so, the Bank ensures  that employees are prepared to take   up higher responsibilities when the  need arises.
Technological  Enhancement in Core  HR Modules We are also committed to leveraging  technology for automation, controls,  and convenience.
Accordingly,  the Bank continued its focus on  transitioning core HR modules to a  common digital platform.
One significant achievement in this  regard, was the successful transition of  the Talent Management module to the  Bank's Human Capital Management  (HCM) System.
This transition resulted  in notable improvements in transaction  time, user experience, and controls,  leading to significant savings.
This eliminates the need for multiple  touchpoints and simplifies the process  for employees, process owners, and  decision-makers.
The technology  journey is always evolving, and the  Bank is committed in ensuring that  the same is leveraged on a continuous  basis to deliver optimal value to the  organisation.
Talent Acquisition The FY23 proved to be an exciting  period for talent acquisition.
Our  People strength has grown with a  good, strong, diversified mix of talent.
Leveraging multi-channel sourcing and  enhancing our recruitment processes,  we strive to ensure a steady supply  of talent across the organisation.
To  meet our growing talent needs, we  have embraced digitalisation and  implemented various cost optimisation  measures.
Currently employee referrals constitute  the largest source of hiring for the  Bank.
For an organisation of our scale  a sustainable mode of resourcing is  to build a fresher talent pool and the  Bank over the years has invested in  partnerships for Job-ready models.
Over the coming years this will become  the most significant channel for talent  acquisition.
We initiated the process to integrate  employees from HDB to Bank with  a focus to reward performance  orientation and to further enhance  frontline and associate workforce  employee experience.
This is being  facilitated in a phased manner  whereby 6,000+ employees have been  integrated.
Gender diversity is an important  organisational priority that is  seamlessly integrated with the talent  acquisition strategy.
Over the year we  have run specific women hiring drives.
Bank Again’ is a program for hiring  women returning after a career break  and special tie-ups with all women  colleges.

Attrition The Bank has seen increased attrition  over the last FY mainly in the ‘non- supervisory levels’, including Frontline  staff and Sales Officers.
Post Pandemic, people in general  seem to be questioning their priorities  and revaluating their lives in ways that  is impacting what they want from work  they do.
This has led to increased  attrition and has impacted employers  across industries.
At the Bank, we are also aware that  the overall employee experience,  especially on Culture, can be better.
We hold RESPECT for ALL as a  fundamental tenet in the way we  work and relate with each other and  the customer.
However, in a large  Organization, it is possible that there  may be some anomalies.
In these  instances, we take quick action and  make sure that our No Tolerance  stance is re-emphasised.
We do have some distance to travel  on this front.
But, we are staying on  course and doing what we can to  accelerate the journey.
In addition,  there are concrete steps being taken  towards building an INCLUSIVE  ORGANSITION.
We believe all this will  go a long way in reining in attrition.

Our training  programmes aim to educate farmers  on various agricultural techniques that  improve productivity while using locally  produced manure and fertilisers while  reducing the reliance on chemical  fertilisers.
We aim to bring 1 Lakh  acres of farmland under chemical-free  farming by FY25.
This intervention is  designed to allow us to maintain the  soil, environment, and health of our  communities.
Reducing carbon footprint We recognise the importance of  helping our communities reduce their  carbon footprint.
Our initiatives in this  direction include planting trees for  carbon sequestration & biodiversity  conservation, and providing clean and  renewable energy solutions to 1,000  villages.
This goal encompasses supporting at  least 25% of the households in each  of the target villages by providing  solar home lights, biomass chulha,  biogas plants, solar study lamps,  solar irrigation units etc.

Playing a pivotal role in promoting  Financial and Economic Inclusion  HDFC Bank has played a significant  role in promoting financial and  economic inclusion by tying up with  Business correspondent agents and  Business Facilitator agents to provide  banking services to customers in  underserved and unbanked areas.
This  journey started in 2018 by partnering  with Common Service Centres (CSCs)  and has now grown into tie-ups with  five more corporates increasing our  agent network further.
With the help of BCs, the Bank has  been able to expand its footprint in  remote and rural areas, where the  penetration of traditional banking  services is low.
Banking agents are  providing services such as cash  deposit and withdrawal, social security  schemes, opening of savings accounts  and lending to marginalised sections  and small businesses through SLI  Loans, Gold Loan, KGC, Agri Loans,  Business Loan and working  capital loan.
45+  Banking products and services can  be accessed via this network.
These BC Agents and BF Agents are  local entrepreneurs belonging to the  neighbourhood who are trained and  authorised by the Bank to provide  banking products digitally and in a  convenient way.
This has helped to  promote financial inclusion and has  contributed to the overall development  of the country's economy.
40 Lakh  Banking products provided   till date across the country   through these agents Providing credit for marginal  sections and agri ecosystem  Another key element of HDFC Bank's  approach is its focus on lending to  marginal sections including farmers,  small businesses, and traders.
The  Bank has launched several initiatives  through BC and BF Agents for  promoting access to credit for these  segments, including the provision of  collateral-free loans and microfinance  products.
These have helped to  HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 141 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements create employment opportunities  and promote economic growth in  underserved communities.
2.92 Lakh  Farmer accounts opened through  alternate channels to support  the agricultural ecosystem of the  country.
Lending to Marginal sections Additionally, HDFC Bank has focused  on empowering women and Self Help  Groups (SHGs) through its agent  network.
With SLI Loans, the Bank  provides Self Help Groups access to  credit and financial services, helping  to promote entrepreneurship and  self-employment.
Social Security  Schemes help create financial safety  net at affordable cost for the marginal  sections.
Thus paving way for Financial  Inclusion in deeper geographies  through the agent network.

BCs are now offering a range of digital  services such as mobile banking,  Aadhaar-enabled payment system  (AEPS), and digital loan processing.

4,363  Villages positively impacted by  providing them with laptops and  digital infrastructure.
Our Business Correspondent network  of 15,000+ agents are digitally  capacitated to not just provide credit  but also collect the instalments of  these loans removing the hassle of  long travel to branches.
EMIs collected: 1.76 Lakh+  transactions across retail and SLI/ JLG loans.
This has not only made banking more  convenient for customers but has  also helped to reduce the cost-of- service delivery for the Bank.
It has  also enabled to reach out to a larger  customer base, including those who  were previously excluded from formal  financial services due to geographical  and economic barriers.
Recognised as Best Financial  Institution in Digital Innovation, at  Bharat Fintech Summit 2023 Another major step in digital adoption  has been the launch of HDFC Bank  Smart Saathi - a digital distribution  platform, which will help onboard  agents across existing and new  corporate partners with speed and  scale, provide on-ground support and  customised training to agents and  ensure seamless delivery of banking  products across geographies.

Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Dear Stakeholders, Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 29th Annual  Report on the business and financial operations of your Bank,  together with the audited accounts for the year ended March  31, 2023.
The year gone by has been the first normal/near normal one in  the last three years as the world largely shook off the effects of  the pandemic and spread cheer.
On the economic front, India's GDP grew by 7.2 per cent in  Financial Year 2022-23 compared to 9.1 per cent in the preceding  year as per the Central Statistical Organisation.
The higher  growth last year in Financial Year 2021-2022 was largely due to  the negative impact of the pandemic in Financial Year 2020-21.
Growth was supported by pent up consumption demand and  easing of supply – side constraints as the economy recovered  from pandemic induced disruptions.
Increased Government  spending improved investment momentum and in turn supported  the recovery of private sector capital expenditure Overall systemic liquidity remained in surplus for much of the  last financial year.
However, RBI started raising rates from May  2022 onwards, cumulatively increasing by 250 basis points.
Global headwinds resulted in slowing export momentum in the  second half of financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24 GDP growth  forecast being revised by 200 basis points.
Although, Indian  banks remain relatively immune to the effects of US regional  banking turmoil, ripple effects of the global turmoil are likely to  be felt on domestic markets due to high inflation, geopolitical  tensions and persistent but continuing localised disruptions of  the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the long run however, we see resilience in the domestic  market against future headwinds as India remains one of the  fastest growing economies globally.
External stability indicators  continue to remain healthy.
Internal consumption demand is  being  supported by the rationalisation of  income tax slabs as  well as 37.4 per cent increase in capital expenditure to ` 10 lakh  crore in the Union Budget for 2023-24.

Your Bank continued to grow in this environment by conducting  its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the  environment and community at large.

172 On the supply side, services growth strengthened further with  improvement in contact-based services, led by trade, transport  and hospitality.
Construction too experienced healthy growth  as it continued the strong momentum from the previous year.
Financial services and agriculture remained steady while  manufacturing growth remained low, growing by 1.3 per cent  in 2022-23.
However, capacity utilisation in manufacturing has  improved, signalling that built up inventories have cleared,  and we might see an improvement in manufacturing activity  going forward.
Strong and continued support by the Government including  extension of the credit guarantee scheme and Garib Kalyan Anna  Yojana (Free food programme, till December 2022) and the rural  job guarantee programme helped in sustaining the recovery.
The near universal administering of COVID-19 vaccine (over 220  crore doses with more than 102 crore individuals administered  at least one dose) has provided cover from the continuous threat  of new virus variants.
Overall systemic liquidity remained in surplus for much of 2022- 23.
However, RBI started raising rates from May 2022 onwards,  cumulatively increasing the rates by 250 basis points through  the year.
This was necessitated mostly due to external factors.
Geopolitical tensions and sanctions, elevated prices of crude oil  and other commodities and lingering COVID-19 related supply  chain bottlenecks exacerbated global uncertainties.
However,  supply disruptions have now normalised, and domestic  inflationary pressures are showing signs of moderation as well.
Going forward we expect global headwinds to weigh on  domestic economic outlook.
The International Monetary Fund  (IMF) in its latest projections has pared India’s growth forecast for  2023-24 to 5.9 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier citing upward  revision in base and tightening monetary conditions.
However,  India remains one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
Global economic activity continues to experience a slowdown  due to a combination of factors.
These include high inflation,  geopolitical tensions in Europe and elsewhere, and persistent  but localised disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic.
Further,  the US regional banking turmoil has led to volatility in the financial  markets, accentuating downside risks to global economic  prospects.
This was cited as a major reason for downward  revision of global growth forecasts by the IMF in its economic  outlook.
Though India and Indian banks remain relatively  insulated from the banking turmoil, materialisation of adverse  outcomes in the global markets is likely to have ripple effects  on domestic markets as well.
Moreover, India is relatively better  positioned to respond to any adverse global shocks with external  stability related indicators (Short-term debt, Forex reserves, FDI  flows) remaining healthy.
Issuance of Equity Shares and Employee Stock  Option Scheme (ESOP) As on March 31, 2023, the issued, subscribed and paid-up  capital of your Bank stood at ` 5,579,742,786/- comprising  5,579,742,786 equity shares of ` 1/- each.
Further, 34,201,810  equity shares of face value of ` 1/- each were issued by your Bank  pursuant to the exercise of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs).
(For information pertaining to ESOPs, please refer Annexure 1  of the Directors’ Report).
Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) As on March 31, 2023, your Bank’s total CAR, calculated as  per Basel III Regulations, stood at 19.3  per cent, well above  the regulatory minimum requirement of 11.7 per cent, including  a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5 per cent and an additional  requirement of 0.2 per cent on account of the Bank being  identified as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank.
Tier I  Capital was at 17.1 per cent as of March 31, 2023 TOTAL CAR 19.3 per cent WELL ABOVE REGULATORY MINIMUM REQUIREMENT  OF 11.70 PER CENT Management Discussion and Analysis Macroeconomic and Industry Developments India’s GDP registered a growth of 7.2 per cent in Financial  Year 2022-23 as per latest estimates by the Central Statistical  Organisation.
This is a moderation from 9.1 per cent growth  in Financial Year 2021-22, largely due to the base effect for  Financial Year 2021-22 owing to the negative economic impact  of pandemic in Financial Year 2020-21.
Growth was supported  by pent up consumption demand and easing of supply – side  constraints as the economy looked to shake off pandemic  induced disruptions.
Private consumption continued to improve, registering a healthy  growth of 7.5 per cent on strong discretionary spending.
Urban  demand showed resilience while rural demand began to show  early signs of recovery.
Investment momentum remained strong  as private capex recovery began supported by rising Government  capital expenditure.
Exports expanded at a healthy rate of 13.6  per cent in Financial Year 2022-23 crossing the $400 billion mark  for the second year  in a row.
However, exports seemed to have  lost some momentum towards the latter half of 2022-23 as global  growth headwinds rose.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 173 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements On the positive side, there are supports for domestic growth  as well.
The Union Budget 2023-24 increased Government’s  allocation on capital expenditure by 37.4 per cent to over 10  lakh crore.
Further, the rationalisation of income tax slabs  announced in the Budget is likely to aid consumption demand  by putting more money in the  hands of people in the lower  income brackets.
Manufacturing and private capital expenditure  may see improvement as inflation moderates supported by the  pause in RBI’s rate hike cycle.
Finally, the normal monsoon  forecast by IMD augurs well for the agriculture sector.
However,  risk of El-Nino negatively affecting temporal and spatial rainfall  distribution remains.
On balance, we expect India’s GDP growth at 6.0 per cent in  2023-24.
Headline inflation has moderated from its peak of 7.8  per cent year-on-year in April 2022, with a cool off in commodity  prices and food inflation as well as an improvement in supply  chains.
Headline inflation stood at 4.8 per cent year-on-year in  June 2023.
However, there are several risks on horizon.
Uneven  nature of monsoons, El-Nino risk and weak progress in Kharif  sowing are some of major risks to inflation outlook.
In 2023-2024,  we estimate headline inflation to average at 5.1 per cent year-on- year.
We expect the RBI to keep the policy rate unchanged at  6.5 per cent  throughout 2023-2024 and see possibility of rate  cuts only in early 2024-2025.
Overall, the Indian economy remained a bright spot even as  geopolitical tensions, banking and financial sector volatility,  historic inflationary highs and COVID-19 related disturbances  affected much of the large economies.
The global headwinds  could cloud the economic outlook, but  India’s domestic resilience  as reflected over 2022-23 is likely to withstand future headwinds.

Digital Interventions Digitising Milk Procurement : This initiative brings  transparency in the milk procurement and payment process,  which benefits both farmers and dairy societies.
Multi-function  Terminals (MFTs), popularly known as Milk-to- Money ATMs, are  deployed in dairy societies.
The MFTs link the milk procurement  system of the dairy society to the farmer’s account to enable  faster payments.
MFTs have cash dispensers that function as  standard ATMs.
Payments are credited without the hassles of  Directors’ Report 180 cash distribution.
Further, this process creates a credit history  which can then be used for accessing bank credit.
Apart  from dairy and cattle loans, customers gain access to all the  Bank’s products including digital offerings such as 10 Second  Personal Loans, Kisan Credit Card, Bill Pay, and Missed Call  Mobile Recharge.
So far, your Bank has digitised payments at  over 1,700 milk cooperatives across 21 states, benefiting more  than 5.9 lakh dairy farmers.
The Dairy business witnessed 86  per cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 78 per cent  in the book.
Substituting Moneylenders: The Bank is strategically expanding its presence in a market  that was previously dominated by unorganized sectors such as  moneylenders and pawn brokers.

Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal Customer Focus is one of the five core values deeply ingrained  in the ethos of your Bank.
With a holistic approach, your  Bank continuously strives to enhance customer experience,  recognising the significance of this in a highly competitive  business environment, especially with diverse lines of  businesses.
Ensuring exceptional product quality and service  delivery becomes paramount for sustained growth.
Your Bank  desires to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well as  benchmarking with best-in-class business entities and facilitating  the implementation of customer-centric improvements.
Your  Bank has adopted a three-step strategy with regards to  Customer Service - Define, Measure, and Improve.
Your Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to provide  an omnichannel experience to its customers.
On one side, your  Bank has traditional touch points like Branch, Email Management  team and PhoneBanking, and on the other side, it has state- of-  the-art platforms like NetBanking, MobileBanking, the chatbot  Eva and the bank’s exclusive social care handles which offer a  wide range of channel choice to its customers.
Your Bank has  also improvised on the relationship-based banking programmes  by introducing a Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) programme  to cater to various financial needs in a personalised manner.
Customer service performance and grievance redressal are  regularly assessed at different levels, including Branch Level  Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), Standing Committee  on Customer Service (SCCS) and Customer Service Committee  of the Board (CSCB).
Your Bank has implemented robust  processes to monitor and measure service quality levels across  touchpoints, including at product and process level, through  diligent work of the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts regular reviews across  various products, processes and channels, focusing on  improving the customer experience.
A unique Service Quality  Index (SQI) has been developed to measure the performance of  key customer facing channels based on critical customer service  parameters.
This SQI enables continuous improvement initiatives  to raise service standards.
The effectiveness of the quality of  service provided is also extensively reviewed, including at the  Customer Service Committee of the Board.
One of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable level  of customer service is to have an effective internal Grievance  Redressal Mechanism / Framework.
Your Bank has developed  a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy,  duly approved by  the Board, which outlines a framework for resolving customer  grievances.
This policy is accessible to customers through the  Bank’s website and branch network.
Your Bank actively participated in RBI’s Nationwide Intensive  Customer Awareness campaign, aiming to enhance customer  awareness on their rights and responsibilities in context of the  customer service standards and the Internal Grievance Redress  (IGR) provided by the Regulated Entities and Alternate Grievance  Redress (AGR) mechanism of RBI.
The initiative emphasised to  HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 185 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements customers about the self-protection measures for safeguarding  against the growing incidents of digital and electronic financial  frauds, reaching even the farthest and remotest areas of  the country.
Your Bank has created multiple channels for customers to provide  feedback and register grievances, facilitating a transparent and  accessible system.
As a pioneer in innovative financial solutions  and digital platforms, your Bank has witnessed an increased  utilisation of its digital channels, resulting in improved customer  loyalty.
Keeping customer interest in focus, your Bank has  formulated a Board approved Protection Policy, which limits  the liability of customers in case of unauthorised electronic  banking transactions.
Your Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through  a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system.
This  customer experience transformation programme will help  employees empathise better with customers and improve  turnaround times.
Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’, the programme  would help establish behaviours and practices that result in  customer-centric actions through continuous improvements in  product, services, process, and policies.
Your Bank remains committed to placing the customer at the  centre of its operations.
By consistently improving customer  experience, adopting an omnichannel approach, and  implementing robust service quality and grievance redressal  mechanisms, your Bank aims to exceed customer expectations  and build lasting relationships.
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality Your Bank's historical focus on Pillar 1 risks, including Credit  Risk, Market Risk, and Operational Risk, has been expanded  in response to the evolving banking landscape.
Liquidity Risk,  Information Technology Risk, and Information Security Risk  have also emerged as critical considerations.
These risks not  only impact your Bank's financial strength and operations but  also its reputation.
To address these concerns, your Bank  has established Board-approved risk strategy and policies  overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC).
The Committee ensures that frameworks are established for  assessing and managing various risks faced by your Bank,  systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s capital level  and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with internal  risk management policies and processes.
The Committee  guides the development of policies, procedures and systems  for managing risks.
It ensures that these are adequate and  appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and  needs of your Bank and its risk appetite.
The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it  is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence  only at the CEO level.
The gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned  and managed include: •	 Credit	Risk,	including	Residual	Risks •	 Market	Risk •	 Operational	Risk •	 Interest	Rate	Risk	in	the	Banking	Book •	 Liquidity	Risk •	 Intraday	Liquidity	Risk •	 Intraday	Credit	Risk •	 Credit	Concentration	Risk •	 Counterparty	Credit	Risk •	 Model	Risk •	 Outsourcing	Risk •	 People	Risk •	 Business	Risk •	 Strategic	Risk •	 Compliance 	Risk •	 Reputation	Risk •	 Technology	Risk •	 Group	Risk Credit Risk Credit Risk is the possibility of losses associated with diminution  in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties.
Losses  stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value.
Your  Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies,  procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail  and wholesale businesses.
Wholesale lending is managed on  an individual as well as portfolio basis.
In contrast, given the  granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed  largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer  segments.
Robust front-end and back-end systems are in  place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses.
The  factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include income,  demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking behavior.
In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed and used  to assess different segments of customers based on portfolio  behavior.
In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping  exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit rating  Directors’ Report 186 grades, and country, among others.
This is backed by portfolio  diversification, stringent credit approval processes, periodic  post-disbursement monitoring, and remedial measures.
Your  Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile times  in the lending environment by stringently adhering to prudent  norms and institutionalised processes.
Your Bank also has a  robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, which are  reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures are within  approved appetite.
As on March 31, 2023, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non-Performing  Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.12 per cent.
Net Non-  Performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific  Loan Loss provisions) was 0.27 per cent of Net Advances.
Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific  provisions on NPAs.
Its provision for NPAs is higher than the  minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory  norms for Standard Assets.
Digital and Credit Risk Driven by rapid technological advancements, the banking  sector is witnessing the increasing importance of digitalisation  as a critical differentiator for customer retention and service  delivery.
Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and quick  method for customers to secure loans with just a few clicks,  often in minutes, if not seconds.
However, addressing the risks  associated with digital lending is crucial, and your Bank has  implemented appropriate measures to manage these risks  effectively.
Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s  existing customers.
Often, they are customers across multiple  products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their credit  history and risk profile.
This accessibility facilitates the evaluation  of their loan eligibility.
Moreover, the credit checks and scores  used by your Bank in process based underwriting are replicated  for digital loans.
This ensures consistency in the evaluation  process.
To further enhance risk management, your Bank has  established an independent model validation unit responsible for  assessing the credit scoring models utilised in generating credit  scores for digital loans.
These models are subject to ongoing  monitoring, periodic reviews, back-testing, and corrective  actions are implemented whenever necessary.
By implementing these measures, your Bank aims to balance the  convenience and speed of digital lending with associated risks.
Market Risk Market Risk arises primarily from your Bank's statutory reserve  management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and  currency market.
These risks are managed through a well-defined  Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign  Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in  different trading desks or various securities through trading risk  limits/triggers.
The risk measures include position limits, tenor  restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration  of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk  (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario-based P&L  Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on  an end-of-day basis.
In addition, forex open positions, currency  option delta, and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed  and monitored on an intraday basis.
This is supplemented by  a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that  simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and  initiate remedial measures.
Your Bank's Market Risk capital  charge is computed daily using the Standardised Measurement  Method applying the regulatory factors.
Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to  meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring  unacceptable losses.
Your Bank's liquidity and interest rate risk  management framework is spelled out through a well-defined  Board approved Asset Liability Management Policy.
As part of  this process, your Bank has established various Board-approved  limits for liquidity and interest rate risks in the banking book.
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit  responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk  management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management  objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set  by the Board.
ALCO reviews the policy's implementation and  monitoring of limits.
While the maturity gap, Basel III ratios, and  stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, Net Interest Income  and market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk in the  banking book.
This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board-  approved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and  interest rate risk.
Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural  pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded  options available to customers, which are used while managing  maturity gaps and repricing risk.
Further, your Bank has the  necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel  Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking  sector.
The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure your  Bank’s liquidity position.
LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has  an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets  (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately  to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day calendar liquidity  stress scenario.
The LCR helps in improving the banking sector’s  ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic  stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spill over  from the financial sector to the real economy.
Based on Basel  III norms, your Bank’s average LCR stood at 115.51 per cent on  HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 187 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements a consolidated basis for financial year 2022-23 as against the  regulatory threshold at 100 per cent.
AVERAGE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO 115.51 per cent ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS FOR FY 2022-23 The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk measure  under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to measure your  Bank’s liquidity position.
The NSFR seeks to ensure that  your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the  composition of its assets and off-balance sheet activities.
The  NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term time horizon by  requiring banks to fund their activities with more stable sources  of funding on an ongoing basis.
The RBI guidelines stipulated a  minimum NSFR requirement of 100 per cent at a consolidated  level and your Bank has maintained the NSFR well above 100  per cent since its implementation.
Based on guidelines issued  by RBI, your Bank’s NSFR stood at 119.13 per cent on a  consolidated basis at March 31, 2023.
Operational Risk This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal  processes, people and systems or from external events.
It also  includes risk of loss due to legal risk.
Given below is a detailed explanation under four different  heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information  Technology and Information Security Practices and Fraud   Monitoring and Control.
A.
Framework and Process To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a  comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework,  whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk  Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC  of the Board.
An independent Operational Risk Management  Department (ORMD) implements the framework.
Under the  framework, the Bank has three lines of defence.
The first line of  defence is the business line (including support and operations).
The first line is primarily responsible for developing risk mitigation  strategies in managing operational risk for their respective units.
The second line of defence is the ORMD, which is responsible  for implementing the operational risk management framework  across the Bank.
It designs and develops tools required for  implementing the framework including policies and processes,  guidelines towards implementation and maintenance of the  framework.
In order to achieve the aforesaid objective pertaining  to operational risk management framework, the ORMC guides  and oversees the functioning, implementation, and maintenance  of operational risk management activities of Bank, with special  focus on: •	 Identification and  assessment of risks across the Bank  through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)  and Scenario analysis •	 Measurement of Operational Risk based on the actual  loss data •	 Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI) •	 Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and loss  data of the Bank Internal Audit is the third line of defence.
The team reviews the  effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal  controls within your Bank.
B.
Internal Control Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices  across all processes, units and functions.
It has well laid down  policies and processes for the management  of  its  day-to-  day activities.
Your Bank follows established, well-designed  controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective  segregation of business and support functions, segregation of  duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting  and periodic MIS.
Specialised risk control units function in risk- prone products/ functions to minimise operational risk.
Controls  are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.
C. Information Technology and Information Security  Practices Your Bank operates in a highly automated environment and makes  use of the latest technologies available on cloud or on Premises  Data centres to support various business segments.
With advent  of new technology tools and increased sophistication, Bank has  improved its efficiency, reduced operational complexities, aided  decision making and enhanced the accessibility of products and  services.
This results in various risks such as those associated  with the use, ownership, operation, redundancy, involvement,  influence, and adoption of IT within an enterprise, as well as  business disruption due to technological failures.
Additionally,  it can lead to risks related to information assets, data security,  integrity, reliability and availability, among others.
Your Bank  has put in place a governance framework, information security  practices, business continuity plan, Disaster Recovery (DR)  resiliency, Security Enhancements, Public Cloud and Cloud  native services adoption and Enhanced Automated Monitoring  mechanisms to mitigate Information Technology and Information  Security-related risks.
The three lines of defence approach is adopted for enterprise-  wide Technology Risk management.
The first line of defence  Directors’ ReportDirectors’ Report 188 holds primary responsibility of managing the risk and ensuring  proper controls are in place.
The second line of defence defines policies, frameworks and  controls.
Information Technology Risk function and Information  Security Group addresses technology and information security  related risks.
A well-documented Board-approved information  security policy and cyber security policy are in place.
Your Bank has a robust Business Continuity and Disaster  Recovery plan that is periodically tested to ensure that it can  meet any operational contingencies.
Further, there is a well- documented crisis management plan in place to address the  strategic issues of a crisis impacting the Bank and to direct and  communicate the corporate response to the crisis including cyber  crisis.
In addition, employees periodically undergo mandatory  business continuity awareness training and sensitisation  exercises on a periodic basis.

An independent assurance team within Internal Audit acts as a  third line of defence that provides assurance on the management  of IT-related risks.
D. Fraud Monitoring and Control Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance Policy  and a central vigilance team that oversees the implementation  of fraud prevention measures.
Frauds are investigated to identify  the root cause and relevant corrective steps are recommended  to prevent recurrence.
Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management and  Board level also deliberate on high value fraud events and advise  preventive actions.
Periodic reports are submitted to the Board  and senior management committees.
Compliance Risk Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your  Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, legal or  regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or  perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations,  and standards.
Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure  the highest standards of compliance.
A dedicated team of  subject matter experts in the Compliance Department works  with business, support and operations teams to ensure active  Compliance Risk management and monitoring.
The team also  provides advisory services on regulatory matters.
The focus is on  identifying and reducing risk by rigorously testing products and  also putting in place robust internal policies.
Products that adhere  to regulatory norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings,  if any, are fully addressed till the product stabilises.
Internal  policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed  frequency or based on market actions or regulatory guidelines/ actions.
The compliance team also seeks regular feedback on  regulatory compliance from product, business and operation  teams through self-certifications and monitoring.
ICAAP Your Bank has a structured management framework in the  Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to  identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material  adverse impact on its business/financial position/capital  adequacy.
The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board  approved ICAAP Policy.
Stress Testing Framework Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing  Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s  ICAAP.
Stress testing involves the use of various techniques  to assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but  plausible stressed business conditions.
The changes in the  levels of Pillar I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the  changes in the on and off-Balance Sheet positions of your Bank  are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity  factors.
The suite of stress scenarios include topical themes  as well as historically observed geopolitical / macroeconomic  / sectoral and other trends.
The stress testing outcome may  be analysed through capital impact and/or identification of  vulnerable borrowers depending on the scenario.
Group Risk Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited  and HDFC Securities Limited.
The Board of each subsidiary is  responsible for managing their respective material risks (Credit  Risk, Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk,  Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk on Banking Book, Technology  Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk, Business Risk and  others).
The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC)  was instituted in your Bank under the ICAAP framework to  establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess  the nature/ quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and  adequacy of its risk management processes.
Stress testing for  the group as a whole is carried out by integrating the stress  tests of the subsidiaries.
Similarly, capital adequacy projections  are formulated for the group after incorporating the business/ capital plans of the subsidiaries.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Your Bank has a robust BCP program in place that enabled  it to continue to operate and deliver quality services during  COVID and beyond.
Our ISO22301:2019 certified Business  Continuity Program enables us to minimize service disruptions  HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 189 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements and potential impact on our employees, customers and business  during any unforeseen adverse events or circumstances.

The central Business Continuity Office works  towards strengthening the Bank’s continuity preparedness.
The  implementation of the program is overseen by the Business  Continuity Steering Committee which is chaired by the Chief  Risk Officer.
The Business Continuity Procedure has well  defined roles and responsibilities for teams involved in Crisis  Management, Business Recovery, Emergency Response, and  IT Disaster Recovery.
Some of the key roles in this program are as follows: •	 Steering	 Committee	 for	centralized	 monitoring	 of	your	 Bank's Business Continuity program implementation •	 Crisis	 Management	 teams	for	effective	 management	 of	 recovery operations during disruptive events •	 Dedicated	 DR	site	for	recovery	of	critical	core	and	customer	 facing applications •	 Functional 	recovery	plans	for	structured 	and	speedy	 recovery of operations •	 Periodic 	drills	are	done	for	testing	the	effectiveness	of	these	 recovery plans.
As a responsible Bank, these robust practices have enabled us  to continue delivering services seamlessly to customers through  the disruptive events and beyond.
Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls and  processes to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised  operations and ‘segregation of duty’ between the front office  and back office.
The front-office units usually act as customer  touchpoints and sales and service outlets while the back-office  carries out the entire processing, accounting and settlement  of transactions in the Bank’s core banking system.

HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 217 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion  1.
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise  the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Profit and Loss Account and the Cash Flow Statement for the year then  ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other  explanatory information.
2.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone  Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013  (“the Act”) in the manner so required for banking companies and are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  in India and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2023, and its profit and its cash flows  for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion  3.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act.
Our  responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Standalone  Financial Statements” section of our report.
We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the  Standalone  Financial Statements under  the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters  4.
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements of the current year.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We  have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Independent Auditor's Report 218 Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA): Total NPA as at March 31, 2023: `18,011.85 Crores  Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2023: `13,643.71 Crores  (Refer Schedule 17 (C)(2), Schedule 18 note 12) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated   April 01, 2022 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential  Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto,  which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of  Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for  such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the  identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances  considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
The identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by  factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated  based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances,  nature of product, value of security etc.
and is also subject to the  minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI.
Since the identification of Non-performing Advances and provisioning   for Non- performing Advances requires considerable level of  management estimation, application of various regulatory requirements  and its significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key  audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following: -  Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and  operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information  Technology based controls, and focused on the following: •	 Monitoring	of	credit	quality	which	amongst	other	things	includes	 	 	 	 the monitoring of overdue loan accounts, drawing power limit,  pending security creation; •	 Identification	and	classification	of	Non-	performing	Advances	in	 accordance with IRAC norms, other regulatory guidelines issued  by the RBI and consideration of qualitative aspects; and •	 Testing	of	application	controls	including	testing	of	automated	 controls, reports and system reconciliations.
- Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations  of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that basis of  provisioning is in accordance with the Board approved policy and  IRAC norms.
- Tested the controls for identification of loans with default events and  / or breach of key covenant, and for a sample of performing loans,  independently assessed as to whether there was a need to classify  such loans as Non-performing Advances.
- On a test check basis, verified the accounts classified by the Bank  as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) in RBI’s Central Repository of  Information on Large Credits (‘CRILC’).
With respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing  Advances, we reperformed the provision calculations on a sample basis  taking into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the  IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our outcome to  that prepared by the management and tested relevant assumptions and  judgements which were used by the management.
219 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Independent Auditor's Report Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large number  of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the operations  of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such  IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application  controls  are  required   to  ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required,  completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) which  have an impact on the financial reporting process and the related  control testing as a key audit matter because of the high level  of  automation, significant number of systems being used by the Bank for  processing financial transactions, the complexity of the IT architecture  and its impact on the financial records and financial reporting process  of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following: In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we  involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of the  IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems.
We evaluated and  tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT systems and  IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit of the standalone  financial statements and financial reporting process of the Bank.
On  such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT general controls with  respect to the following domains: •	 Program	 change	 management,	 which	 includes	 that	 program	 changes are moved to the production environment as per defined  procedures and relevant segregation of environment is ensured.
•	 User	access	management,	which	includes	user	access	provisioning,	 de-provisioning, access review, password management, sensitive  access rights and segregation of duties to ensure that privilege access  to applications, operating systems and databases in the production  environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
•	 Program	development,	which	includes	controls	over	IT	application	 development or implementation and related infrastructure, which are  relied upon for financial reporting.
•	 IT	operations,	which	includes	job	scheduling,	monitoring	and	backup	 and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness  of relevant key IT dependencies within the key business process,  which included testing automated controls, automated calculations /   accounting procedures, interfaces, segregation of duties and system  generated reports, as applicable.
We communicated with those charged with governance and  management and tested a combination of compensating controls or  remediated controls and / or performed alternative audit procedures,  where necessary.
Other Information 5.
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included  in the annual report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
The annual  report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form  of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified  above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the  Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate  the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial  Statements 6.
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation  of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and  cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting  Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, and the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949  220 and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time.
This responsibility also  includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the  assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate  accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and  maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true  and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
7.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless management and Board of Director either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic  alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 8.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of  these Standalone Financial Statements.
9.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout  the audit.
We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or  error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is  higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances.
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing our opinion on whether  the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management of the Bank.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are  required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up  to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a  going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation.
10.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the  audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
11.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements  regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought  to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
221 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Independent Auditor's Report 12.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters.
We  describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter 13.
The Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended March 31, 2022, were jointly audited by MSKA &  Associates and M M Nissim & Co LLP, who, vide their report dated April 16, 2022, expressed an unmodified opinion on those  Standalone Financial Statements.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 14.
In our opinion, the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of  Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act.
15.
As required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that: (a) we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary  for the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory; (b) the transactions of the Bank, which have come to our notice, have been within the powers of the Bank; (c)  During the course of our audit, we have visited 69 branches to examine the books of account and other records maintained  at the branch and performed other relevant audit procedures.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the  Bank”) as of March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year  ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 2.
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control  over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business,  including adherence to Banks’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the  accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required  under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility 3.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Banks's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial  Statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing  deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls,  both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI.
Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and  if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
4.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system  with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness.
Our audit of internal financial controls with  reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference  to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error.
5.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Banks’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Financial Statements 6.
A Bank's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A Bank's internal financial controls with  reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of  records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial  Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are  being made only  in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable  224 assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's assets that  could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements 7.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including  the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may  occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone  Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone  Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion 8.
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone  Financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were operating  effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank  considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 235 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedule 17 -  Significant accounting policies  appended to and forming part of the financial  statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 A BACKGROUND HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or ‘the Bank’),  incorporated in Mumbai, India is a publicly held banking  company engaged in providing a range of banking and  financial services including retail banking, wholesale  banking and treasury operations.
The Bank is governed  by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies  Act, 2013.
The Bank has overseas branch operations in  Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit at  International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City,  India.
The financial accounting systems of the Bank are  centralised and, therefore, accounting returns are not  required to be submitted by branches of the Bank.
B BASIS OF PREPARATION The standalone financial statements have been prepared  and presented under the historical cost convention and  accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and  are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles in India (‘GAAP’), statutory requirements  prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars and guidelines  issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from time to  time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards (‘AS’) specified  under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read  together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and  the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, in so  far as they apply to banks.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity  with GAAP requires the management to make estimates  and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of  assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as  of the date of the financial statements and the reported  income and expenses for the reporting year.
Management  believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the  financial statements are prudent and reasonable.
Actual  results could differ from these estimates.
Any revision in  the accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the  current and future periods.
C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  1 Investments   Classification:  In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are  classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading”  (‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity”  (‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”).
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done  in accordance with the RBI guidelines.
Under each of  these categories, investments are further classified under  six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government  Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures  and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures  and Other Investments.
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted  on settlement date except in the case of equity shares  which are accounted on trade date.
Basis of classification: Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from  the date of purchase are classified under HFT category.
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are  classified under HTM category.
Investments in the equity  of subsidiaries / joint ventures are classified under HTM  category.
Investments which are not classified in either of  the above categories are classified under AFS category.
Acquisition cost:  Brokerage, commission, etc.

Profit / Loss on short sale is recognised on settlement date.
Valuation: Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories  are marked to market individually and depreciation /  appreciation is aggregated for each group.
Net depreciation,  if any, compared to the acquisition cost, in any of the six  groups, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
The net  appreciation, if any, in any of the six groups is not recognised  except to the extent of depreciation provided earlier.
The  Schedules to the Financial Statements As at March 31, 2023 236 book value of individual securities is not changed on such  revaluation of investments.
Traded investments are valued based on the trades /  quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices  published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd.  (FBIL) with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives  Association (FIMMDA) as the calculating agent.

The market value of unquoted government of India securities,  state government securities and special bonds such as oil  bonds, fertilizer bonds etc.
issued by the government of  India is computed as per the prices published by FBIL with  FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz.
other approved securities and bonds and debentures), and  preference shares, is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e.
applicable FIMMDA published credit spread over the Yield  to Maturity (YTM) rates for government of India securities as  published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up  value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 for  each company.
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest net asset value  declared by the respective schemes of the mutual fund.
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits  being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost.
Investments in Security receipts (SR) and unquoted  units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are valued  as per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset  Reconstruction Company and InvIT trust respectively.
Investments in unquoted units of Alternative Investment  Fund (AIF) are categorised, at the discretion of the Bank,  under HTM category for an initial period of three years and  valued at cost during this period.
Such investments are  transferred to the AFS category after the said period of  three years.
Investments in AFS category are valued at  NAV shown by the AIF in its financial statements.
Units are  valued based on the latest audited financials of the AIF, if  available, or at ` 1 per AIF as per the RBI guidelines.
Pass Through Certificates (PTC) including Priority Sector- PTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spread as  applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating  of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for government  of India securities published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the  calculating agent.
Investments classified under HTM category are carried  at their acquisition cost and not marked to market.
Any  premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining  maturity period of the security on a constant yield-to- maturity basis.
Such amortisation of premium is adjusted  against interest income from investments.
Any diminution,  other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM  category is provided for.
Non-performing investments are identified and provision  are made thereon based on the RBI guidelines.
The  provision on such non-performing investments is  not set  off against the appreciation in respect of other performing  investments.
Interest on non-performing investments is not  recognised until received.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions: Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse  Repo) transactions are reflected as borrowing and lending  transactions respectively.
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as  interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions  is accounted as interest income.
2 Advances Classification: Advances are classified as performing and non-performing  based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills  rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific  loan loss provision, interest in suspense for non-performing  advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors,  provision for funded interest term loan and provision for  diminution in the fair value of restructured assets.
Provisioning: The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including  at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised  derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing  in accordance with RBI guidelines.
Further the NPAs are  classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets  based on the RBI guidelines.
Non-performing assets are  upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing  advances is made based on management’s assessment  of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the  minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI.
The specific provision for retail non-performing advances  is also made based on the nature of product and  delinquency levels.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing  advances is included under Provisions and Contingencies.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 237 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance  with the Bank’s policy.
Recoveries from bad debts written- off are included under other income.
In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing  borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount  of overdue and future receivables relating to positive  marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets  including credit exposures computed as per the current  marked to market values of interest rate and foreign  exchange derivative contracts and gold.
The Bank also  maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency  exposures of borrowers as prescribed by RBI.
In the case  of overseas branches, general provision on standard assets  is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the  respective overseas regulator or RBI.
The provision for  standard assets is included under other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis  makes provision on advances or exposures which are not  NPAs,but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant  environment or specific information or basis regulatory  guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific  advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential  exposures.
These are classified as contingent provisions  and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific  loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible  slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general  provision is categorised as floating provision.
Creation of  floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level  approved by the Board of Directors.
Floating provisions  are used only for contingencies under extraordinary  circumstances and for making specific provisions for non- performing accounts.
Floating provisions are included  under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according  to the asset classification status, provision is held for  individual country exposures (other than for home country  exposure).
Countries are categorised into risk categories  as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.  (‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect of  that country where the net funded exposure is one percent  or more of the Bank’s total assets.
Provision for country risk  is included under other liabilities.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential  framework for resolution of stressed assets and the  resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and  its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented  resolution plans for eligible borrowers.
The asset  classification and necessary provision thereon is made in  accordance with the said RBI guidelines.
The restructured  loans are upgraded into standard category as per the  extant RBI guidelines.
3 Securitisation and transfer of assets Assets transferred through securitisation and direct  assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance  Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met  with) and consideration is received.
Sales / transfers that do  not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings.
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the  Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss  is recognised at the time of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below  the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific  provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and  Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the  net book value, the excess provision is credited to the  Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash  received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption  or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds  the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset  securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security  receipts (SRs) issued against the assets transferred  by it is  more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against  outstanding SRs are higher of the provisions required in  terms of net asset value declared by the Securitisation  Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) and  provisions as per the extant norms applicable to the  underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these  SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming the  loans remained in the books of the Bank.
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) issued  by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).
These are accounted  at acquisition cost and are classified as investments.
The  Bank also buys loans through the direct assignment route  which are classified as advances.
These are carried at  acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in  which case the premium is amortised based on effective  interest rate method.
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank  participation with and without risk.
In the case of participation  with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued  by the Bank is reduced from advances.
In case where  the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate  amount of the participation is classified under advances.
In the case of issue of participation certificate without  risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the  Schedules to the Financial Statements As at March 31, 2023 238 Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank  is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount  of participation acquired is shown as due from banks  under advances.
4 Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any.
Cost  includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site  preparation, installation costs and professional fees  incurred on the asset before it is ready to use.
Subsequent  expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only  when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability  from / of such assets.
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of  the fixed asset on a straight-line basis.
The management  believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the  Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment,  changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset  in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed  assets.
The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are  given below: Asset Estimated  useful life as  assessed by  the Bank Estimated  useful life  specified  under  Schedule  II of the  Companies  Act, 2013 Owned Premises 60 years 60 years Automated Teller Machines  (ATMs) 10 years 15 years Electrical equipments and  installations 6 to 8 years 10 years Office equipments 3 to 6 years 5 years Computers 3 years 3 years Modems, routers, switches,  servers, network and related IT  equipments 3 to 6 years 6 years Motor cars 4 years 8 years Furniture and fittings 16 years 10 years •	 Improvements	 to	lease	hold	premises	are	amortised	 over the remaining primary period of lease.
•	 Software	 and	system	 development	 expenditure	 is	 amortised over a period of 5 years.
•	 Point	 of	Sales	(PoS)	terminals	are	depreciated	over	a	 period of 4 years.
•	 For	 assets	 purchased	 and	 sold	 during	 the	 year,	 depreciation is provided on pro-rata basis.
•	 Whenever	 there	is	a	revision	of	the	estimated	useful	 life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount  is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the  said asset.
•	 Profit	 on	sale	of	immovable	 property	 net	of	taxes	 and transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to  capital reserve.
•	 Assets	 (other	than	PoS	terminals)	costing	less	than	 ` 5,000 individually, are fully depreciated in the year  of purchase.
5 Impairment of assets The Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether  there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the  carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated  recoverable amount.
6 Translation of foreign currency items Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic  operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing  on the date of the transaction.
Income and expenditure  items of integral foreign operations (representative offices)  are translated at the weekly average closing rates and  of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and  offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
Outstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic  and integral foreign operations are translated at the closing  exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’  Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date  and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss is recognised  in the Profit and Loss Account.
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency  assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations  are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI  at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss  arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the  Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of the  non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS-11,  The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the  extant RBI guidelines.
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on  account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts,  guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and  endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange  notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
7 Foreign exchange and derivative contracts Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding  as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are  revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively  as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts  of interim maturities.
The USD-INR exchange rate for  HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 239 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e.
greater  than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as  well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve.
For  other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the  forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI)  are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv  or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts.
Valuation is  considered on present value basis.
For this purpose, the  forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the  valuation date using the discounting yields.
The resulting  profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and  Loss Account.
Marked to market value of foreign exchange  contracts are classified as assets when the fair value is  positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for  trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of  reporting currency required or available at the settlement  date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance  Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate.
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such  forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line  basis as expense or income over the life of the contract.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value,  on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered  into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance  Sheet date.
Marked to market values of such derivatives  are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as  liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes  use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange  forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in  some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the  balance sheet.
The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset  or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself.
Hedge  effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of  the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of  the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised  in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow  hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are  recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow  hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective  hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit  and Loss Account.
The accumulated balance in the cash  flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is  recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time  that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account.
8 Revenue recognition Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account  on an accrual basis, except in the case of non-performing  assets and overdue interest on retail EMI based performing  advances, which are recognised when realised.
In case  of domestic advances, where interest is collected on rear  end basis, such interest is accounted on receipt basis in  accordance with the RBI communication.
Interest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought  out through the direct assignment route is recognised at  their effective interest rate.
Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is  recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant  yield basis.
Dividend on equity shares and preference shares is  recognised as income when the right to receive the      dividend is established.
Income from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on  cash basis.
Loan processing fee is recognised as income when due.
Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when  a significant act / milestone is completed.
Gain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with  the extant RBI guidelines.
Guarantee commission, commission on letter of credit,  annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards  are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period  of contract.
Other fees and commission income are  recognised when due, where the Bank is reasonably  certain of ultimate collection.
Fees paid / received for priority sector lending certificates  (PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the period  of the certificate.
9 Employee benefits  Stock based Employee Compensation: The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’)  provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares  of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors.
The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme -2022  (ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock  Units (RSUs) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its  employees and whole-time directors.
The options / units  granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these  may be exercised within a specified period.
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for  its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of  options granted up to March 31, 2021.
Compensation cost  Schedules to the Financial Statements As at March 31, 2023 240 is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of  the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined  under the option plan.
The market price is the closing  price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading  volume on the working day immediately preceding the date  of grant.
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked  instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted  after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in  accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of  Whole	Time	Directors	/	Chief	Executive	Officers	/	Material	 Risk Takers and Control Function staff.
The fair value of the  stock-based employee compensation is estimated on the  date of grant using Black-Scholes model.
The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line  basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated  forfeiture.
Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest  is recognized.
The compensation expense is recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to  Employee Stock Options Reserve.
On exercise of the stock  options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock Options  Reserve is transferred to Share Premium.
In respect of the  options which expire unexercised, the balance standing to  the credit of Employee Stock Options Reserve is transferred  to General Reserve.
Gratuity: The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined  benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees.
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of  service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an  upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for  each completed year of service to all eligible employees on  resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on  termination of employment.
The Bank makes contributions  to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and  whose funds are managed by insurance companies.
In  respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees,  the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and  administered by the Board of Trustees.
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an  independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using  the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of  AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value  of the defined benefit obligation and the related service  costs.
The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about  demographics, early retirement, salary increases and  interest rates.
Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account.
Superannuation: The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which  employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are  entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary  or under a defined contribution plan.
For those opting for  a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum  equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic  salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain  eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of  Punjab (eCBoP staff)) to a Trust administered by trustees  and whose funds are managed by insurance companies.
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation  fund benefits other than its contribution and recognises  such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
Provident fund: The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund  and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly  all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits  under the provident fund.
The Bank contributes an amount,  on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12%  of employee’s basic salary).
Of this, the Bank contributes  an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up  to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the  Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident  Fund Office.
The balance amount out of the 12% employer’s  share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the  Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees.
The Bank  recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in  which it is incurred.
Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust shall  not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by  the Central Government under the Employees Provident  Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and  shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee  Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established  provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be  provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plan.
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall  is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by  The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards  this liability is made.

HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 241 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements  Pension: In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees  under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension  Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank  contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up  by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and  an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on  an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet  date, which includes assumptions about demographics,  early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to  a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure  and had completed less than 15 years of service, the  contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a  fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a  lock-in-period of two years.
For this category of employees,  liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required  except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which  is provided for.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC  structure and had completed service of more than 15 years,  pension would be paid on separation based on salary  applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure.
Provision thereto is made based on an independent  actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the  NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic  salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined  contribution plan, which is managed and administered by  pension fund management companies.
The Bank has no  liability other than its contribution and recognises such  contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
10 Debit and credit cards reward points The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit  and credit card reward points and cost per point using an  actuarial method by employing an independent actuary,  which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption  and spends.
Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding  reward points are made based on an independent actuarial  valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in  other liabilities and provisions.
11 Bullion The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on  a consignment basis.
The imports are typically on a back- to-back basis and are priced to the customer based on  the price quoted by the supplier.
The difference between  the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion  is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and  reported as ‘‘Other Income’’.
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending  basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest  expense / income respectively.
12 Lease accounting Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken  on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss  Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in  accordance with the AS-19, Leases.
13 Income tax Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e.
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance  with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there  under and considering the material principles set out in  Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the  net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the  year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for  the future tax consequences of timing differences between  the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their  respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward,  if any.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using  the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the  Balance Sheet date.
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets  and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes  levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has  a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends to settle  on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there  is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised  in future.
In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried  forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are  recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation  of such assets.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each  Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the  amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.
14 Earnings per share The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity  share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share.
Basic  earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing  net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by  the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  for the period.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential  dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to  issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity  during the year.
Diluted earnings per equity share are  computed using the weighted average number of equity  Schedules to the Financial Statements As at March 31, 2023 242 shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding  during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive.
15 Share issue expenses Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium  Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
16 Segment information  The disclosure relating to segment information is in  accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per  guidelines issued by RBI.
17 Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities and  contingent assets In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets, the Bank recognises provisions  when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event,  it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  can be made.
Provisions are determined based on management estimate  required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date,  supplemented by experience of similar transactions.
These  are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to  reflect the current management estimates.
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is: •	 a	 possible	obligation	arising	from	a	past	event,	the	 existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence  or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future  events not within the control of the Bank; or •	 a	 present	obligation	arising	from	a	past	event	which	 is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow  of resources will be required to settle the obligation  or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  cannot be made.
When	there	is	a	possible	obligation	or	a	present	obligation	 in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is  remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial  statements since this may result in the recognition of  income that may never be realised.
18 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash including  foreign currency notes and gold in hand, balances with  RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and  short notice.
19 Corporate social responsibility Expenditure towards corporate social responsibility, in  accordance with Companies Act, 2013, is recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account.

Unhedged foreign currency exposure The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk.
The credit appraisal memorandum  prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange risk that the customer  is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external commercial borrowings.
It  could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate  exchange risk.
For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to  enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank.
Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has  the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the  risk.
On a periodic basis, the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers,  whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold.
A Board approved credit risk rating linked  limit on unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer.
The  compliance with the limit is assessed by estimating the extent of drop in a customer’s annual Earnings Before Interest and  Depreciation (‘EBID’) due to a potentially large adverse movement in exchange rate impacting the unhedged foreign currency  exposure of the customer.
Where a breach is observed in such a simulation, the customer is suitably advised to review and  manage its unhedged exposure, where deemed necessary.

•	 Qualitative	disclosures	on	risk	exposure	in	derivatives Overview of business and processes Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates,  exchange rates or indices.
These include forwards, swaps, futures and options.
The notional amounts of financial  instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments  recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current  fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks.
The following  sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank.
Interest rate contracts Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period  commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date).
The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve,  interest rate index or bond yield.
There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date.
The  settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date  discounted for the interest period of the agreement.
Interest rate swaps  involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without  exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.
Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest.
The writer of  the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively.
A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and  floor spreads.
Interest rate futures  are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy  or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a  specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.
Exchange rate contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate  on a future date.
These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.
Cross currency swaps  are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies.
Cross  currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in  another specified currency for a specified period.
Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right  but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before a specified  future date.
Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency  on a certain date in the future, at a specified price.
The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of  currency with another.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 257 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023 The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities.
Sale activities include the structuring and marketing  of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the  regulatory framework as applicable from time to time.
The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity)  principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility.
The Bank  also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.
Constituents involved in derivative business The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties.
The Bank  has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines.
The Bank has credit risk and market risk  departments, as part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market risk limits, within  the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.
Derivative policy The Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative  business.
The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits,  sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at-risk limits  that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval.
All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the market  risk and credit risk units.
Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.
The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative  policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of  business / operations.
Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various  risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite and  the customer’s requirements.
Classification of derivatives book The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book.
Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis  of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines.
The trading book is managed within the  trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
Hedging	policy For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the  relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the  hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness.
Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of  inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter.
Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in  the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value  or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.
The tenor of hedging instrument  may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability.
The Bank as part of its risk management  strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded  in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the balance sheet.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in  the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of  cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, the changes in fair value  of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an  effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
The accumulated balance in the cash  flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that  the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Foreign exchange forward contracts and  principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required  or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued  at the closing spot rate.
The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised  as expense or income over the life of the contract.
258 Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial position.
The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in  the event of crystallisation of the exposure.
Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events  to call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk.
Further, to mitigate the current exposure in non- centrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’) agreements with  some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.
The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements.
Overdue receivables  representing crystallised positive mark to market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the  borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more.
Full provision is made  for the entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing  derivative contracts.

Considering the terms ‘loans not in default’ and ‘special mention account’ under this circular  vis-à-vis loans termed as ‘standard’ as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such  assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore  transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 are not considered relevant for disclosure.

Contingent liability* Brief description 1 Claims against  the Bank not  acknowledged as  debts - taxation The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending.
The Bank  expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on similar issues in the  previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws.
2 Claims against  the Bank not  acknowledged as  debts - others The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
The Bank does not  expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial  conditions, results of operations or cash flows.
3 Partly paid investments This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.
4 Liability on account of  forward exchange and  derivative contracts The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements,  currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for  customers.
Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a  future date at the contracted rate.
Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by  way of interest / principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates.
Interest  rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows.
The notional  amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis  for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate  the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore,  do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks.
The derivative instruments become  favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative  to their terms.
5 Guarantees given on  behalf of constituents,  acceptances,  endorsements and  other obligations As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees  on behalf of its customers.
Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing  of the Bank’s customers.
Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will  make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.
6 Other items for  which the Bank is  contingently liable These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills rediscounted by  the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; e) Investment purchases pending  settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund  (DEAF).

II.
Design and Structure of Remuneration  The design and structure of remuneration in accordance with the RBI guidelines dated November 04, 2019, pertaining  to the performance year 2021-2022 and the related payouts made in the financial year ended March 31, 2023 are  as follows: a)	 Fixed	Pay  The Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into  account all relevant factors including industry practice.
Elements	of	Fixed	Pay: The fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base  salary, allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits.
Perquisites extended are in the nature of company  car, company leased accommodation, club membership and such other benefits or allowances in lieu of such  perquisites / benefits.
Retirement benefits include contributions to Provident Fund, Superannuation Fund  (for employees above certain job bands), National Pension Scheme and Gratuity.
The Bank also provides  pension to certain employees of the erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) under the Indian Banks’ Association  (‘IBA’) structure.
Determinants	of	Fixed	Pay: The fixed pay is primarily determined by taking into account factors such as the job size, performance,  experience, location, market competitiveness of pay and is designed to meet the following key objectives of: (a)  fair compensation given the role complexity and size; (b)  fair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position;  (c) contribution to post retirement benefits; and (d)  compliance with all statutory obligations.
The quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e.
Employees in Executive Vice President and above  grades, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management  Personnel are approved by the NRC and the Board.
The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to  the approval of the RBI.
b)	 Variable	Pay	-	For	Senior	Management	and	Material	Risk	Takers  The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank.
The Remuneration  Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both,  quantitative and qualitative performance measures.
(i)		 Composition	of	Variable	Pay  The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked instruments.
The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2022-23 was the Employee Stock Options.
All plans  for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to  time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank.
These plans provide for the grant of options post  approval by the NRC.
For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the  Reserve Bank of India.
The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay.
In cases where  compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable  pay will be in cash.
280 (ii)		 Limits	on	Variable	Pay  A substantial portion of compensation i.e.
at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual,  business-unit and organization performance.
This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels  of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher.
The total variable pay shall be limited to a  maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period).
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case  the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments.
The non-cash component in 2022-23 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments,  his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(iii)		Deferral	of	Variable	pay  For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs),  deferral arrangements exists for the variable pay.
A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral  arrangements.
If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred.
In cases where cash component of the variable pay is under ` 25 lakh, deferral of cash variable pay is not  applied (in line with RBI guidelines).
The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components  of variable pay.
The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme  Rules which is approved by the NRC and the Board.
In 2022-23, the deferment of cash variable pay,  where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of  Employee Stock Options.
(iv)		Vesting	of	Variable	Pay	  The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the  course of the deferral period.
The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the  deferral period.
The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more  than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.
(v)		 Malus	/	Clawback	Arrangement:  The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking.
The Bank,  therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
Malus Arrangement : The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the  deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e.
any Share Linked Instrument).
The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or  part of the amount of a deferred remuneration.
Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has  already occurred.”  Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward  (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e.
any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years  attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred.
The return would be in terms of  net amount.
The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between  the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration  to the bank under certain circumstances.”  The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving  fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory  norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses.
Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to  have a malafide intent.
Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below.
The occurrence of any / some  / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus  or the Clawback arrangement: HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 281 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023 a)  Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters b)  Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior c)  Fraud that requires a financial restatement d)  Reputational harm e)  Exposing the bank to substantial risk f)  Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering  review by NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement   In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into  consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or  whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes  in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other  socio-economic conditions etc.
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback  arrangement based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person,  the NRC shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event  or misconduct.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for  Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public dis- closure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment  year under ‘malus’ arrangement.
Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for  the assessment year) shall be entertained.
In case the bank’s post assessment gross NPAs are less than  2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of  divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the variable pay.
The time horizon for the application  of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable  to a Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (Job Bands C1 and above) prior to  applying the Malus or Clawback arrangement.
(vi)		Approval	Process:	  The Variable Pay for Senior Management, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk  and control staff is approved by the NRC and the Board.
For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is  approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
Employees	other	than	Senior	Management,	Material	Risk	Takers,	Whole	Time	Directors  The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans: (i)		 Annual	Bonus	Plan	  The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the  business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional  category.
Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for  variable pay is developed.
Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from  compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in  both the quantum and the method of payout across functions.
Typically higher levels of responsibility  receive a higher proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay.
(ii)		 Performance-linked	Plans	(PLPs)	  PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles  who are given business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are  exercised independent of these functions.
All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard  282 framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to  achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees.
A  portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen  performance risks.
Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(iii)		Employee	Stock	Option	Plan	(ESOPs)  Employees in Job Bands D3 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between  short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation.
ESOPs play a key role in the attraction  and retention of key talent.
The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance  rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC.
All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended  from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank.
These plans provide for the  grant of options post approval by the NRC.
The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees.
Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a  period of 48 months.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.
(iv)		Restricted	Stock	Units	(RSUs)  The bank introduced RSUs in FY2022-23 for employees at E3 – D2 bands (upto 10 levels below the  MD).
The overall grant criteria is based on the bank meeting certain parameters such as shareholder’s  return, asset quality, return on assets, profitability and return on capital.
The quantum of RSUs to be granted to individual employees was based on an employee’s grade  and performance rating over the previous three years.
The vesting criteria would be based on the profitability of the bank.
All plans for grant of RSUs are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended  from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank.
These plans provide for the  grant of RSUs post approval by the NRC.
Such RSUs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.
Risk, Control and Compliance Staff  The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions  in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict  of interest between revenue generation and risk management and control.
Accordingly, the overall  variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and  Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals.
The Bank  ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of  fixed compensation.
Guaranteed 	Bonus  Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance  principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice.
For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based  on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost  of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost  implication for the Bank.
For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account  appropriate risk factors and market conditions.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 283 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023  For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain  employees in select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would  be in the form of Employee Stock Options.
Severance Pay  The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension)  except in cases where it is mandated by any statute.
Hedging  The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to  insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their  compensation arrangement.
Statutory Bonus  Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended  from time to time.
III.
Remuneration Processes  Fitment at the time of hire  Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials  of the incumbent.
The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of  the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles.
The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and  the Bank’s talent management priorities.
While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant  of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market.
Accordingly, there could be  certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the  overall pay philosophy.
Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval  with appropriate justification.
Pay Increment / Pay Revision  The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on  optimising cost.
In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of  the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared  to peers.
The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of  fixed pay over time.
This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience,  job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.
Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year.
However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay  during other times of the financial year.
The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning for  the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information  Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank.
However, such pay  revisions are done on an exception basis.
The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Whole time Directors), Senior Management, Key Management  Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board.
The Fixed Pay for the Whole Time Directors is approved by the  NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
C. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes,  including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes.
The Bank follows a comprehensive  framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long  term incentives (i.e.
Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units).
284 Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively  positioned in terms of fixed pay.
The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation  are based on performance.
The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of  employees vis-à-vis market reference points.
Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk  due to attrition is mitigated.
Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of  misconduct by an employee.
Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below: (a)	 Quarterly	/	monthly	performance-linked	pay	(PLP)	plans: All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within its  ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive advantage  for the Bank.
PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the non-fulfillment  of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors.
Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-compliance, mis-sell  etc.
Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any  unforeseen performance risks.
Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(b)	 Variable	Pay: The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various types of  risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.
The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of  the Bank and profitability.
The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit, individual performance, job band  and role of the individual for non-business functions.
The business unit performance is based on factors such as growth  in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key objectives.
Bonus pay out for  an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting  the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct.
The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, Material Risk  Takers, Senior Management (i.e.
employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above ).
Under the malus  clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part.
Under the claw back clause  the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to the reference performance year.
The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and the Board.
D. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement  period with levels of remuneration The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors.
The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as  quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters: 1. Business Performance  - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value 2.
Stakeholder Relationship  - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility 3.
Audit and Compliance  - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and  inspection reports 4.
Digital Transformation  - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank 5.
Organizational Excellence   - This includes succession planning and employee engagement While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time  Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint: a) Increase in plan over the previous year; b) Actual growth in revenue over previous year; c) Growth in net revenue (%); d) Achievement of net revenue against plan (%); e) Actual profit before tax;  HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 285 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023 f) Growth in profit before tax compared to the previous year;  g) Improvement in cost to income over the previous year; h) Improvement in Gross NPA over the previous year; and i) Achievement of key strategic objectives.
The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit and  individual employees is articulated below: Fixed Pay The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market  corrections.
These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the  individual employee.
For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating.
The Bank  strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time.
All other  things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.
Variable	Pay Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following  variable pay plans:  •	 Variable	Pay	Plans:  For Employees in Job Bands of Vice President and Above (includes employees in Senior Management,  Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors) the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term  sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.
Short term Performance:  Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay.
The cash variable  pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the  business performance multiplier and role.
The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary.
Long term Performance:  Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating  and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of  shareholder value.
For	Employees	in	job	bands	below	Vice	President:  At these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual performance.
In FY 2022-23, the Bank introduced RSUs for select employees at E3-D2 bands based on their performance rating  over the previous three years and grade.
The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band.
The bonus multiple  is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and  the functional category of the individual employee.
The business performance category determines the multiplier for  the bonus.
All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the performance  rating.
Employees who are part of the annual cash Variable Pay plan are not part of the Performance Linked Plans  mentioned below.
•	 Performance-linked	Plans	(PLPs)  The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given  sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology.
All PLP payouts are subject to the  achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by  qualitative parameters.
A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any  unforeseen performance risks.
All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,  could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
E. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term  performance  For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the bank seeks to adjust  remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.
286 (i)		 Limits	on	variable	pay  A substantial portion of compensation i.e.
at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business- unit and organization performance.
This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the  proportion of variable pay will be higher.
The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay.
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the  variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments.
The non-cash  component in 2022-23 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share linked instruments, his / her  variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(ii)		 Deferral	of	variable	pay  For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements  will exist for the variable pay.
A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements.
If cash  component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred.
In cases where cash  component of the bonus is under ` 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.
The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components  of variable pay.
The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules  which will be approved by the NRC and the Board.
In 2022-23 the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable,  was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.
(iii)		Vesting	of	Variable	Pay	  The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the course  of the deferral period.
The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the deferral period.
The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be more than a year  in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.
(iv)		Malus	/	Clawback	Arrangement:  The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking.
The Bank, therefore, has  devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
Malus Arrangement : The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred  portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e.
any Share Linked Instrument).
The RBI guidelines  define malus thus “A Malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred  remuneration.
Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”  Clawback Arrangement : The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash  variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e.
any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable  to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred.
The return would be in terms of net amount.
The  RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A Clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the  bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain  circumstances.”  The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent  behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in  financial or non-financial losses.
Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent.
Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below.
The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions /  events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement: a)  Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters b)  Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior c)  Fraud that requires a financial restatement d)  Reputational harm e)  Exposing the bank to substantial risk HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 287 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023 f)  Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by  NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement   In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into consideration  and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether it was on account  of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure  events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement  based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided  by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing  Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay  the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement.
Further,  in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained.
In case  the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public  disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred Variable pay.
The time horizon for the  application of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to a  Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (C1 and above) prior to applying the Malus or  Clawback arrangement.
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the NRC annually.
Employees	other	than	Whole	Time	Directors,	Material	Risk	Takers	and	Senior	Management The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans: •	 Annual	Variable	Pay	plan:  The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual employee,  job band of the employee and the functional category.
Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk  alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed.
Market trends for specific businesses / functions along  with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum  and the method of payout across functions.
Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of  variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay.
Variable Pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder  value creation.
Short term Performance:  Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay.
The cash variable  pay is based on performance rating, the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the  business performance multiplier and role.
The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary.
Long term Performance:  Employee Stock Options are granted to employees at D3 and above bands based on  their performance rating and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank  and creation of shareholder value.
The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.
The Bank also introduced Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) to employees at E3-D2 bands in FY22-23.
The RSUs would  vest over 4 years.
•	 Performance-linked	Plans	(PLPs)  The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given  sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology.
All PLP payouts are subject to the  achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by  288 qualitative parameters.
A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any  unforeseen performance risks.
All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,  could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
F.	 Description	 of	the	different	forms	of	variable	remuneration	(i.e.
cash,	shares,	ESOPs	and	other	forms)	that	the	 Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms  The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture.
Variable pay stimulates  employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
•	 Annual	Cash	Variable	Pay  These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year.
This covers all employees (excluding employees  under PLPs).
This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional  category of the individual.
For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be  higher.
For Material Risk Takers, Senior Management and Whole Time Directors 50% of the cash variable pay is  deferred over 3 years in the event the cash variable pay exceeds ` 25 lakhs.
•	 Performance-linked	Plans	(PLPs)  The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given  sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology.
All PLP payouts are subject to the  achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by  qualitative parameters.
A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any  unforeseen performance risks.
All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,  could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
•	 Employee	Stock	Option	Plan	(ESOP)  This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing      shareholder value.
Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for  stock options.
Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.
•	 Restricted	Stock	Units	(RSUs)  The Bank introduced Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) for employees at E3-D2 bands in FY22-23.
The RSUs would  vest over 4 years.
Quantitative	disclosures The quantitative disclosures for the financial year ended March 31, 2023 cover the Bank’s Whole Time Directors and Material  Risk Takers.
The material risk takers are identified in accordance with the revised guidelines on remuneration issued by the  RBI on November 04, 2019.
Hitherto, the quantitative disclosures would cover the Bank’s Whole Time Directors and Key Risk  Takers as per the erstwhile guidelines on remuneration dated January 13, 2012.

296 Qualitative	disclosure	on	LCR The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector.
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks.
It does this by ensuring  that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and  immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario.
The LCR is expected to  improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus  reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board.
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk  management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance /  limits set by the Board.
The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk Management  Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically  assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management processes, including  providing oversight for managing liquidity risk.
Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations is directly managed at  the Head Office.
The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their liquidity requirements  with support from the Head Office.
Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their liquidity requirements under  guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews the risk assessment of material  risks at the subsidiaries.
Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity requirements in other  currencies as appropriate.
In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which  include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which  would cover all residual deposits).
Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, and cash management  services are classified as Operational Deposits.
Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are  expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows.
These classifications, based on extant regulatory  guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank's stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period.
The  guidelines for LCR were effective January 01, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which have risen in equal annual  steps to reach 100% on January 01, 2019.
This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced  without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity.
The  present requirement, as on March 31, 2023 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities  (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and  offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period.
Given below is a table of run-off factors and  the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years: Particulars Run-off factors Retail Deposits 5% - 10% Small Business Customers 5% - 10% Operational Deposits 5% - 25% Non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs         40% Other legal entities      100% Quarter ended LCR Maintained (Average) LCR Required March 31, 2023 114.85% 100.00% December 31, 2022 112.97% 100.00% September 30, 2022 118.21% 100.00% June 30, 2022 107.43% 100.00% March 31, 2022 111.89% 100.00% December 31, 2021 122.71% 100.00% September 30, 2021 122.78% 100.00% June 30, 2021 125.62% 100.00% HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 297 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2023 The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was at 114.85% as against 111.89% for the quarter ended March 31,  2022, and above the present prescribed minimum requirement of 100%.
The average HQLA for the quarter ended March  31, 2023 was ` 442,566.92 crore, as against ` 385,997.51 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.
During the same  period the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at 89.95% as compared to 89.04% in  the previous year.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) / collateral requirements and undrawn  commitments constituted just about 0.67% and 2.78% respectively of average cash outflow as against 0.58% and 2.51%  respectively for quarter ended March 31, 2022.
The Bank has consistently maintained a robust funding profile with a significant  portion of funding through deposits.
As of March 31, 2023 the top 20 depositors comprised of 4.55% of total deposits indicating  a healthy and stable deposit profile.

Implementation of IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in its press release dated January 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for implementation of  Indian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial banks, insurers / insurance companies and non-banking  financial companies, which was subsequently confirmed by the RBI through its circular dated February 11, 2016.
This roadmap  required these institutions to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods beginning April 01, 2018  with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017.
The implementation of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative  changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the disclosures required under IND-AS.
In April 2018, the RBI  deferred the implementation of IND-AS by a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were expected.
The legislative  amendments recommended by the RBI are under consideration by the Government of India.
Accordingly, the RBI, through  its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice.
The Bank, being an associate of Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (the ‘Corporation’), submits its consolidated  financial information (‘fit for consolidation information’), prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement  principles of IND-AS as specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the Corporation for the purposes of  the consolidated financial statements / results of the Corporation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 17 of the  “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters  4.
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements of the current year.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We  have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
306 Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing advances (NPA): Total NPA as at March 31, 2023: ` 18,011.85 Crores Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2023: ` 13,643.71 Crores (Refer Schedule 17 (C) (2), Schedule 18 note 12 of the standalone financial statements) Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated 1  October, 2021 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential  Norms for Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto,  which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of  Non-performing Advances (“NPA”) and the minimum provision required  for such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement  to determine the identification and provision required against NPA  considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
The identification of NPA is also affected by factors like stress and  liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified NPA is estimated based on ageing and  classification of NPA, value of security etc.
and is also subject to the  minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI.
Our audit procedures included the following: - Understood the process and controls, and tested the design  and operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information  Technology based controls, and focused on the following: •	 Monitoring	of	credit	quality	which	amongst	other	things	includes	 the monitoring of overdue loan accounts, drawing power limit,  pending security creation; •	 Identification	 and	 classification	 of	 NPA	 in	 accordance	 with	 IRAC norms, other regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and  consideration of qualitative aspects; and •	 Testing	 of	 application	 controls	 include	 testing	 of	 automated	 controls, reports and system reconciliations.
- Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations  of provision of non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in  accordance with the Board approved policy.
- Tested the controls for identification of loans with default events  and / or breach of other qualitative factors, and for a sample of  performing loans, independently assessed as to whether there was  a need to classify such loans as NPA.
-   On a test check basis, verified the accounts classified by the Bank  as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) in RBI’s Central Repository of  Information on Large Credits (‘CRILC’).
-    With respect to provisions recognised towards NPA, we  reperformed the provision calculations on a sample basis taking  into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the IRAC  norms and NPA policy of the Bank, and compared our outcome to  that prepared by the management and tested relevant assumptions  and judgements which were used by the management.
307 Overview Our   Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Independent Auditor's Report Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large  number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the  operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume  of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such  IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required  to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required,  completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems)  which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the  related control testing as a key audit matter because of the high level of  automation, significant number of systems being used by the Bank for  processing financial transactions, the complexity of the IT architecture  and its impact on the financial records and financial reporting process  of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:  In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we  involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of the  IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems.
We evaluated and  tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT systems and  IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit of the standalone  financial statements and financial reporting process of the Bank.
On  such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT general controls with  respect to the following domains: •	 Program	 change	 management,	 which	 includes	 that	 program	 changes are moved to the production environment as per defined  procedures and relevant segregation of environment is ensured.
•	 User	access	management,	which	includes	user	access	provisioning,	 de- provisioning, access review, password management, sensitive  access rights and segregation of duties to ensure that privilege  access to applications, operating systems and databases in the  production environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
•	 Program	development,	which	includes	controls	over	IT	application	 development or implementation and related infrastructure, which are  relied upon for financial reporting.
•	 IT	operations,	which	includes	job	scheduling,	monitoring	and	backup	 and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness  of relevant key IT dependencies within the key business process,  which included testing automated controls, automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, segregation of duties and system  generated reports, as applicable.
We communicated with those charged with governance and  management and tested a combination of compensating controls or  remediated controls and / or performed alternative audit procedures,  where necessary.

Key Audit Matter How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit 2.
Information Technology IT systems and controls The Company’s financial reporting processes are  dependent on technology considering significant number  of transactions that are processed daily across multiple and  discrete Information Technology (‘IT’) systems.
The Financial  accounting system of the Company is interfaced with several  other IT systems including Loan Management & Originating  systems and several other systemic workflows.
IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that  changes to applications and underlying data are made in  an appropriate manner.
Adequate controls contribute to  mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of  changes to the applications and data.
These includes implementation of preventive and detective  controls across critical applications and infrastructure.
Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology  systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk  assessment, we planned our audit by assessing the risk  of a material misstatement arising from the technology as  significant for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter.
In course of audit, our focus was on user access management, change  management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation controls and  system application controls over key financial accounting and reporting  systems.
We performed a range of audit procedures, which included: - Review of the report of IS Audit carried in earlier year(s) by an  independent firm of Chartered Accountants pertaining to IT systems  general controls including access rights over applications, operating  systems and databases relied upon for financial reporting.
- Deployed our internal experts to carry out IT general Controls  testing and identifying gaps, if any.
- Our other processes include: - Selectively recomputing interest calculations and maturity dates; - Selectively re-evaluating masters updation, interface with resultant  reports; - Selective testing of the interface of INFOR with other IT systems like  LMS and other workflows.
- Testing of the system generated reports and accounting entries  manually for core financial reporting matters (i.e.
verification around  the computer system).
- Evaluating the design, implementation and operating effectiveness  of the significant accounts-related IT automated controls which are  relevant to the accuracy of system calculation, and the consistency  of data transmission.
- Other areas that were independently assessed included password  policies, system configurations, system interface controls, controls  over changes to applications and databases.

Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form  of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information  identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially  misstated.
When we read the Annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate  the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial  Statements 8.
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements  in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial  performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group including the Employee welfare trust in accordance with the accounting  principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, and the  provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of  India (“RBI”) from time to time.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the trustees of  the Employee welfare trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions  311 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Independent Auditor's Report of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the employee welfare trust and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that  were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements  by the Board of Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid.
9.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group  and the trustees of the Employee welfare trust are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and the Employee welfare  trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern  basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and the Employee welfare trust or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
10.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the trustees of the Employee welfare trust are  responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and the employee welfare trust.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 11.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will  always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of these Consolidated  Financial Statements.
12.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout  the audit.
We also: a Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether   due to fraud  or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is  higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.
b Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances.
Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether  the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls.
c Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management.
d Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt  on the ability of the Group and the Employee welfare trust to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit  evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and  the Employee welfare trust to cease to continue as a going concern.
e Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures,  and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation.
312 f Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within  the Group and the Employee welfare trust to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are  responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included  in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors.
For the other entities included in the  Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible  for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them.
We remain solely responsible for our  audit opinion.
13.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the Consolidated  Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during  our audit.
14.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements  regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought  to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
15.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most  significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse  consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Inherent Limitations of  Internal Financial Controls with  reference to  financial statements 7.

The provision for  standard assets is included under other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis  makes provision on advances or exposures which are not  NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant  environment or specific information or basis regulatory  guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific  advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential  exposures.
These are classified as contingent provisions  and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific  loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible  slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general  provision is categorised as floating provision.
Creation of  floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level  approved by the Board of Directors.
Floating provisions  are used only for contingencies under extraordinary  circumstances and for making specific provisions for non- performing accounts.
Floating provisions are included  under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according  to the asset classification status, provision is held for  individual country exposures (other than for home country  exposure).

3 Securitisation and transfer of assets HDFC Bank Limited Assets transferred through securitisation and direct  assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance  Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met  with) and consideration is received.
Sales / transfers that do  not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings.
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the  Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss  is recognised at the time of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below  the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific  provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and  Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the  net book value, the excess provision is credited to the  Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash  received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption  or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds  the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset  securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security  receipts (SRs) issued against the assets transferred by it is  more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against  outstanding SRs are higher of the provisions required in  terms of net asset value declared by the Securitisation  Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) and  provisions as per the extant norms applicable to the  underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these  SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming the  loans remained in the books of the Bank.
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) issued  by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).
These are accounted  at acquisition cost and are classified as investments.

In the case of participation  with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued  by the Bank is reduced from advances.
In case where  the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate  amount of the participation is classified under advances.
In the case of issue of participation certificate without  risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the  Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank  is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount  of participation acquired is shown as due from banks  under advances.

7 Foreign exchange and derivative contracts HDFC Bank Limited Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding  as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are  revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively  as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts  of interim maturities.
The USD-INR exchange rate for  valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e.
greater  than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as  well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve.
For  other currency pairs and non-deliverable contracts, the  forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI)  are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv  or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts.
Valuation is  considered on present value basis.
For this purpose, the  forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the  valuation date using the discounting yields.
The resulting  profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and  Loss Account.
Marked to market value of foreign exchange  contracts are classified as assets when the fair value is  positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
HDFC Bank Limited  Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 335 Overview Our  Performance Our   Strategy Introduction to   HDFC Bank How We   Create Value Responsible   Business Statutory Reports and   Financial Statements Schedules to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at March 31, 2023 Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for  trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of  reporting currency required or available at the settlement  date of a transaction and are outstanding at the Balance  Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate.
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such  forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line  basis as expense or income over the life of the contract.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value,  on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered  into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance  Sheet date.
Marked to market values of such derivatives  are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as  liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes  use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange  forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in  some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the  balance sheet.
The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset  or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself.
Hedge  effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of  the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of  the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised  in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow  hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are  recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow  hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective  hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit  and Loss Account.
The accumulated balance in the cash  flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is  recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time  that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account.
HDB Financial Services Limited Derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges,  the hedging instrument is measured at fair value and any  gain or loss that is determined to be an effective hedge is  recognised within equity i.e., Cash Flow Hedge Reserve.
Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to the Profit  and Loss Account in the same period as the cash flows of  hedged items affect the Profit and Loss Account.
When a  derivative contract expires or is sold or if a hedge no longer  meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative  profit or loss in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained  in equity until the hedged cash flow is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account.
However, if hedged cash flows  are no longer expected to occur, the profit or loss against  the corresponding derivative contract, accumulated in the  Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, is immediately released through  the Profit and Loss Account.
Changes in the fair values  of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge  accounting are recognised immediately in the Profit and  Loss Account.

The options / units  granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these  may be exercised within a specified period.
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for  its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of  options granted up to March 31, 2021.
Compensation cost  is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of  the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined  under the option plan.
The market price is the closing  price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading  volume on the working day immediately preceding the date  of grant.

Gratuity: The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined  benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees.
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of  service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an  upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for  each completed year of service to all eligible employees on  resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on  termination of employment.
The Bank makes contributions  to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and  whose funds are managed by insurance companies.
In  respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees,  the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and  administered by the Board of Trustees.
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an  independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using  the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of  AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value  of the defined benefit obligation and the related service  costs.
The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about  demographics, early retirement, salary increases and  interest rates.
Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account.
Superannuation: The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which  employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are  entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary  or under a defined contribution plan.

The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation  fund benefits other than its contribution, and recognises  such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
Provident fund: The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund  and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly  all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits  under the provident fund.
The Bank contributes an amount,  on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12%  of employee’s basic salary).
Of this, the Bank contributes  an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up  to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the  Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident  Fund Office.
The balance amount out of the 12% employer’s  share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the  Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees.
The Bank  recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in  which it is incurred.
Interest payable to the members of the  exempted trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate  of interest declared by the Central Government under the  Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions  Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by  the Bank.
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee  Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established  provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be  provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plan.
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall  is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by  The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards  this liability is made.
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the  respective applicable government social security scheme  calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries.
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions,  which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in  the nature of defined contribution.
Pension: In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees  under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension  Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank  contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up  by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and  an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on  an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet  date, which includes assumptions about demographics,  early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to  a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure  and had completed less than 15 years of service, the  contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a  fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a  lock-in-period of two years.
For this category of employees,  liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required  except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which  is provided for.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC  structure and had completed service of more than 15 years,  pension would be paid on separation based on salary  applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure.
Provision thereto is made based on an independent  actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
National Pension Scheme (NPS): In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the  NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic  salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined  contribution plan, which is managed and administered by  pension fund management companies.
The Bank has no  liability other than its contribution, and recognises such  contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
HDFC Securities Limited Short term Short term employee benefits include salaries and  performance incentives.
A liability is recognised for the  amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus  or target based incentives if the Company has a present  legal or informal obligation to pay this amount as a result of  past service provided by the employee, and the obligation  can be estimated reliably.
These costs are recognised as an  expense in the Profit and Loss Account at the undiscounted  amount expected to be paid over the period of services  rendered by the employees to the Company.
Post-employment The Company offers its employees long term benefits by  way of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, of  which some have assets in special funds or securities.
The  plans are financed by the Company and in the case of  some defined contribution plans by the Company along  with its employees.
Defined-contribution plans These are plans in which the Company pays pre-defined  amounts to separate funds and does not have any legal  or informal obligation to pay additional sums.
These  comprise of contributions to the National Pension Scheme,  Employees’ Provident Fund, Family Pension Fund and  Superannuation Fund.
The Company’s payments to the  338 defined-contribution plans are reported as expenses during  the period in which the employees perform the services  that the payment covers.
Defined-benefit plans Expenses for defined-benefit gratuity plan are calculated  as at the Balance Sheet date by an independent actuary  in a manner that distributes expenses over the employee’s  working life.
These commitments are valued at the present  value of the expected future payments, with consideration  for calculated future salary increases, using a discount rate  corresponding to the interest rate estimated by the actuary  having regard to the interest rate on government bonds with  a remaining term that is almost equivalent to the average  balance working period of employees.
The fair values of  the plan assets are deducted in determining the net liability.

The spot, forward and swap contracts, outstanding  as on the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued  at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by  FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India) and at  interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities.
The USD/  INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e.
greater than one (1) year is implied from the applicable INR and  USD swap curves.
For other pairs, where the rates / tenors  are not published by FEDAI, the spot and forward points are  obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the foreign  exchange deals.
The foreign exchange profit or loss is arrived on  present value basis thereafter, as directed by FEDAI, whereby the  forward profits or losses on the deals, as computed above, are  discounted till the valuation date using the applicable discounting  yields.
The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognized in  the Statement of Profit and Loss.
